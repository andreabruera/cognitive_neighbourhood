But mine was answered , for the flat bumped right into a pile for a minute and I flung the scarf and the shawl over my shoulder and scrambled up on a big providential stub . And there I was , Mrs. Allan , clinging to that slippery old pile with no way of getting up or down . It was a very unromantic position , but I did n't think about that at the time .

The liniment cake mistake cured me of carelessness in cooking . Dyeing my hair cured me of vanity . I never think about my hair and nose now -- at least , very seldom .

I meant to tell you , Marilla , honestly I did , but I forgot . Miss Stacy caught me reading Ben Hur in school yesterday afternoon when I should have been studying my Canadian history . Jane Andrews lent it to me . I was reading it at dinner hour , and I had just got to the chariot race when school went in . I was simply wild to know how it turned out -- although I felt sure Ben Hur must win , because it would n't be poetical justice if he did n't -- so I spread the history open on my desk lid and then tucked Ben Hur between the desk and my knee . I just looked as if I were studying Canadian history , you know , while all the while I was reveling in Ben Hur . I was so interested in it that I never noticed Miss Stacy coming down the aisle until all at once I just looked up and there she was looking down at me , so reproachful-like . I ca n't tell you how ashamed I felt , Marilla , especially when I heard Josie Pye giggling . Miss Stacy took Ben Hur away , but she never said a word then . She kept me in at recess and talked to me . She said I had done very wrong in two respects . First , I was wasting the time I ought to have put on my studies ; and secondly , I was deceiving my teacher in trying to make it appear I was reading a history when it was a storybook instead . I had never realized until that moment , Marilla , that what I was doing was deceitful . I was shocked . I cried bitterly , and asked Miss Stacy to forgive me and I 'd never do such a thing again ; and I offered to do penance by never so much as looking at Ben Hur for a whole week , not even to see how the chariot race turned out . But Miss Stacy said she would n't require that , and she forgave me freely . So I think it was n't very kind of her to come up here to you about it after all .

I would n't be a bit afraid , and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry-tree all white with bloom in the moonshine , do n't you think ?

Mrs. Spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that , but I did n't mean to be wicked . It 's so easy to be wicked without knowing it , is n't it ? They were good , you know -- the asylum people . But there is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum -- only just in the other orphans . It was pretty interesting to imagine things about them -- to imagine that perhaps the girl who sat next to you was really the daughter of a belted earl , who had been stolen away from her parents in her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess . I used to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that , because I did n't have time in the day . I guess that 's why I 'm so thin -- I am dreadful thin , ai n't I ?

There 's so little scope for imagination in cookery . You just have to go by rules . The last time I made a cake I forgot to put the flour in . I was thinking the loveliest story about you and me , Diana . I thought you were desperately ill with smallpox and everybody deserted you , but I went boldly to your bedside and nursed you back to life ; and then I took the smallpox and died and I was buried under those poplar trees in the graveyard and you planted a rosebush by my grave and watered it with your tears ; and you never , never forgot the friend of your youth who sacrificed her life for you . Oh , it was such a pathetic tale , Diana . The tears just rained down over my cheeks while I mixed the cake . But I forgot the flour and the cake was a dismal failure . Flour is so essential to cakes , you know . Marilla was very cross and I do n't wonder . I 'm a great trial to her . She was terribly mortified about the pudding sauce last week . We had a plum pudding for dinner on Tuesday and there was half the pudding and a pitcherful of sauce left over . Marilla said there was enough for another dinner and told me to set it on the pantry shelf and cover it . I meant to cover it just as much as could be , Diana , but when I carried it in I was imagining I was a nun -- of course I 'm a Protestant but I imagined I was a Catholic -- taking the veil to bury a broken heart in cloistered seclusion ; and I forgot all about covering the pudding sauce . I thought of it next morning and ran to the pantry . Diana , fancy if you can my extreme horror at finding a mouse drowned in that pudding sauce ! I lifted the mouse out with a spoon and threw it out in the yard and then I washed the spoon in three waters . Marilla was out milking and I fully intended to ask her when she came in if I 'd give the sauce to the pigs ; but when she did come in I was imagining that I was a frost fairy going through the woods turning the trees red and yellow , whichever they wanted to be , so I never thought about the pudding sauce again and Marilla sent me out to pick apples . Well , Mr. and Mrs. Chester Ross from Spencervale came here that morning . You know they are very stylish people , especially Mrs. Chester Ross . When Marilla called me in dinner was all ready and everybody was at the table . I tried to be as polite and dignified as I could be , for I wanted Mrs. Chester Ross to think I was a ladylike little girl even if I was n't pretty . Everything went right until I saw Marilla coming with the plum pudding in one hand and the pitcher of pudding sauce warmed up , in the other . Diana , that was a terrible moment . I remembered everything and I just stood up in my place and shrieked out ` Marilla , you must n't use that pudding sauce . There was a mouse drowned in it . I forgot to tell you before . ' Oh , Diana , I shall never forget that awful moment if I live to be a hundred . Mrs. Chester Ross just looked at me and I thought I would sink through the floor with mortification . She is such a perfect housekeeper and fancy what she must have thought of us . Marilla turned red as fire but she never said a word -- then . She just carried that sauce and pudding out and brought in some strawberry preserves . She even offered me some , but I could n't swallow a mouthful . It was like heaping coals of fire on my head . After Mrs. Chester Ross went away , Marilla gave me a dreadful scolding . Why , Diana , what is the matter ?

So I took the brooch . I thought I could put it back before you came home . I went all the way around by the road to lengthen out the time . When I was going over the bridge across the Lake of Shining Waters I took the brooch off to have another look at it . Oh , how it did shine in the sunlight ! And then , when I was leaning over the bridge , it just slipped through my fingers -- so -- and went down -- down -- down , all purply-sparkling , and sank forevermore beneath the Lake of Shining Waters .

Carrie Sloane kept saying every few minutes , ` The time has come for us to part , ' and that would start us off again whenever we were in any danger of cheering up . I do feel dreadfully sad , Marilla . But one ca n't feel quite in the depths of despair with two months ' vacation before them , can they , Marilla ? And besides , we met the new minister and his wife coming from the station . For all I was feeling so bad about Mr. Phillips going away I could n't help taking a little interest in a new minister , could I ? His wife is very pretty . Not exactly regally lovely , of course -- it would n't do , I suppose , for a minister to have a regally lovely wife , because it might set a bad example . Mrs. Lynde says the minister 's wife over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she dresses so fashionably . Our new minister 's wife was dressed in blue muslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses . Jane Andrews said she thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for a minister 's wife , but I did n't make any such uncharitable remark , Marilla , because I know what it is to long for puffed sleeves . Besides , she 's only been a minister 's wife for a little while , so one should make allowances , should n't they ? They are going to board with Mrs. Lynde until the manse is ready .
