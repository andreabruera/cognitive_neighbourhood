Mrs. Rachel Lynde is Surprised |MRS.
<p/>Rachel Lynde lived just where the Avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow, fringed with alders and ladies' eardrops and traversed by a brook that had its source away back in the woods of the old Cuthbert place; it was reputed to be an intricate, headlong brook in its earlier course through those woods, with dark secrets of pool and cascade; but by the time it reached Lynde's Hollow it was a quiet, well-conducted little stream, for not even a brook could run past Mrs. Rachel Lynde's door without due regard for decency and decorum; it probably was conscious that Mrs. Rachel was sitting at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) window, keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed, from brooks and children up, and that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) noticed anything odd or out of place she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) would never rest until she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof. There are plenty of people in Avonlea and out of it, who can attend closely to their neighbor's business by dint of neglecting their own; but Mrs. Rachel Lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) was a notable housewife; her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) work was always done and well done; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``ran''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>the Sewing Circle, helped run the Sunday-school, and was the strongest prop of the Church Aid Society and Foreign Missions Auxiliary. Yet with all this Mrs. Rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) kitchen window, knitting <div class="bookquote">``cotton warp''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lynde/Mrs. Rachel/Rachel</b></font>)</div>quilts--she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) had knitted sixteen of them, as Avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices--and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up the steep red hill beyond.
<p/>Since Avonlea occupied a little triangular peninsula jutting out into the Gulf of St. Lawrence with water on two sides of it, anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of Mrs. Rachel's all-seeing eye. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) was sitting there one afternoon in early June. The sun was coming in at the window warm and bright; the orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridal flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of bees. Thomas Lynde--a meek little man whom Avonlea people called <div class="bookquote">``Rachel Lynde's husband'' (<font color='red'><b>Avonlea people</b></font>)</div>--was sowing his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) late turnip seed on the hill field beyond the barn; and Matthew Cuthbert ought to have been sowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) on the big red brook field away over by Green Gables. Mrs. Rachel knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) ought because she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) tell Peter Morrison the evening before in William J. Blair's store over at Carmody that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmody</b></font>) meant to sow his (<font color='blue'><b>Carmody</b></font>) turnip seed the next afternoon. Peter had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Carmody</b></font>), of course, for Matthew Cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) whole life. And yet here was Matthew Cuthbert, at half-past three on the afternoon of a busy day, placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill; moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) wore a white collar and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) best suit of clothes, which was plain proof that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) was going out of Avonlea; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) had the buggy and the sorrel mare, which betokened that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) was going a considerable distance. Now, where was Matthew Cuthbert going and why was he (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) going there? Had it been any other man in Avonlea, Mrs. Rachel, deftly putting this and that together, might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions.
<p/>But Matthew so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) might have to talk. Matthew, dressed up with a white collar and driving in a buggy, was something that didn't happen often. Mrs. Rachel, ponder as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) might, could make nothing of it and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) afternoon's enjoyment was spoiled. <div class="bookquote">``I'll just step over to Green Gables after tea and find out from Marilla where he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>)'s gone and why,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the worthy woman finally concluded. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) doesn't generally go to town this time of year and he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) never visits; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>)'d run out of turnip seed he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) wouldn't dress up and take the buggy to go for more; he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) wasn't driving fast enough to be going for a doctor. Yet something must have happened since last night to start him (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) off. I'm clean puzzled, that's what, and I won't know a minute's peace of mind or conscience until I know what has taken Matthew Cuthbert out of Avonlea today. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lynde/Mrs. Rachel/Rachel</b></font>)</div>Accordingly after tea Mrs. Rachel set out; she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) had not far to go; the big, rambling, orchard-embowered house where the Cuthberts lived was a scant quarter of a mile up the road from Lynde's Hollow. To be sure, the long lane made it a good deal further. Matthew Cuthbert's father, as shy and silent as his (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) son after him (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>), had got as far away as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) possibly could from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) founded his (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) homestead.
<p/>Green Gables was built at the furthest edge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) cleared land and there it was to this day, barely visible from the main road along which all the other Avonlea houses were so sociably situated. Mrs. Rachel Lynde did not call living in such a place living at all. <div class="bookquote">``It's just staying , that's what,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) said as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) stepped along the deep-rutted, grassy lane bordered with wild rose bushes. <div class="bookquote">``It's no wonder Matthew and Marilla are both a little odd, living away back here by themselves. Trees aren't much company, though dear knows if they were there'd be enough of them. I'd ruther look at people. To be sure, they seem contented enough; but then, I suppose, they're used to it. A body can get used to anything, even to being hanged, as the Irishman said. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lynde/Mrs. Rachel/Rachel</b></font>)</div>With this Mrs. Rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of Green Gables. Very green and neat and precise was that yard, set about on one side with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim Lombardies. Not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen, for Mrs. Rachel would have seen it if there had been. Privately she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) was of the opinion that Marilla Cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) swept her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) house. One could have eaten a meal off the ground without over-brimming the proverbial peck of dirt. Mrs. Rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bidden to do so. The kitchen at Green Gables was a cheerful apartment--or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully clean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor.
<p/>Its windows looked east and west; through the west one, looking out on the back yard, came a flood of mellow June sunlight; but the east one, whence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry-trees in the left orchard and nodding, slender birches down in the hollow by the brook, was greened over by a tangle of vines. Here sat Marilla Cuthbert, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) sat at all, always slightly distrustful of sunshine, which seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) too dancing and irresponsible a thing for a world which was meant to be taken seriously; and here she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) sat now, knitting, and the table behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) was laid for supper. Mrs. Rachel, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) had fairly closed the door, had taken a mental note of everything that was on that table. There were three plates laid, so that Marilla must be expecting some one home with Matthew to tea; but the dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab-apple preserves and one kind of cake, so that the expected company could not be any particular company. Yet what of Matthew's white collar and the sorrel mare? Mrs. Rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery about quiet, unmysterious Green Gables. '' Good evening, Rachel,'' Marilla said briskly. <div class="bookquote">``This is a real fine evening, isn't it? Won't you sit down? How are all your folks? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed and always had existed between Marilla Cuthbert and Mrs. Rachel, in spite of--or perhaps because of--their dissimilarity. Marilla was a tall, thin woman, with angles and without curves; her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) dark hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) looked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) was; but there was a saving something about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) mouth which, if it had been ever so slightly developed, might have been considered indicative of a sense of humor. <div class="bookquote">``We're all pretty well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lynde/Mrs. Rachel/Rachel</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Rachel. <div class="bookquote">``I was kind of afraid you weren't, though, when I saw Matthew starting off today. I thought maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was going to the doctor's. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla's lips twitched understandingly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had expected Mrs. Rachel up; she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) had known that the sight of Matthew jaunting off so unaccountably would be too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) neighbor's curiosity. '' Oh, no, I'm quite well although I had a bad headache yesterday,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Matthew went to Bright River. We're getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in Nova Scotia and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)'s coming on the train tonight. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>If Marilla had said that Matthew had gone to Bright River to meet a kangaroo from Australia Mrs. Rachel could not have been more astonished. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) was actually stricken dumb for five seconds. It was unsupposable that Marilla was making fun of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>), but Mrs. Rachel was almost forced to suppose it. '' Are you in earnest, Marilla? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) demanded when voice returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>). '' Yes, of course,'' said Marilla, as if getting boys from orphan asylums in Nova Scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well-regulated Avonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation. Mrs. Rachel felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) had received a severe mental jolt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) thought in exclamation points. A boy! Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of all people adopting a boy! From an orphan asylum! Well, the world was certainly turning upside down! She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) would be surprised at nothing after this! Nothing!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What on earth put such a notion into your head? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) demanded disapprovingly. This had been done without her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) advice being asked, and must perforce be disapproved. '' Well, we've been thinking about it for some time--all winter in fact,'' returned Marilla. '' Mrs. Alexander Spencer was up here one day before Christmas and she (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in Hopeton in the spring. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) cousin lives there and Mrs. Spencer has visited here and knows all about it. So Matthew and I have talked it over off and on ever since. We thought we'd get a boy. Matthew is getting up in years, you know-- he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)'s sixty--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) isn't so spry as he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) once was. His (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) heart troubles him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) a good deal. And you know how desperate hard it's got to be to get hired help. There's never anybody to be had but those stupid, half-grown little French boys; and as soon as you do get one broke into your ways and taught something he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)'s up and off to the lobster canneries or the States. At first Matthew suggested getting a Home boy. But I said `no' flat to that. ' They may be all right--I'm not saying they're not--but no London street Arabs for me,' I said. ' Give me a native born at least. There'll be a risk, no matter who we get. But I'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born Canadian.' So in the end we decided to ask Mrs. Spencer to pick us out one when she (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) went over to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) little girl.
<p/>We heard last week she (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) was going, so we sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) word by Richard Spencer's folks at Carmody to bring us a smart, likely boy of about ten or eleven. We decided that would be the best age--old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up proper. We mean to give him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a good home and schooling. We had a telegram from Mrs. Alexander Spencer today--the mail-man brought it from the station--saying they were coming on the five-thirty train tonight. So Matthew went to Bright River to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>). Mrs. Spencer will drop him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) off there. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) goes on to White Sands station herself.'' Mrs. Rachel prided herself on always speaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) mind; she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) proceeded to speak it now, having adjusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) mental attitude to this amazing piece of news. '' Well, Marilla, I'll just tell you plain that I think you're doing a mighty foolish thing--a risky thing , that's what. You don't know what you're getting. You're bringing a strange child into your house and home and you don't know a single thing about him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) nor what his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) disposition is like nor what sort of parents he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) had nor how he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>)'s likely to turn out. Why, it was only last week I read in the paper how a man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife up west of the Island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) set fire to the house at night--set it on purpose , Marilla--and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their beds. And I know another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs--they couldn't break him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) of it.
<p/>If you had asked my advice in the matter--which you didn't do, Marilla--I'd have said for mercy's sake not to think of such a thing , that's what.'' This Job's comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm Marilla. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) knitted steadily on. <div class="bookquote">``I don't deny there's something in what you say, Rachel. I've had some qualms myself. But Matthew was terrible set on it. I could see that, so I gave in. It's so seldom Matthew sets his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) mind on anything that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) does I always feel it's my duty to give in. And as for the risk, there's risks in pretty near everything a body does in this world. There's risks in people's having children of their own if it comes to that--they don't always turn out well. And then Nova Scotia is right close to the Island. It isn't as if we were getting him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) from England or the States. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) can't be much different from ourselves.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I hope it will turn out all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lynde/Mrs. Rachel/Rachel</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Rachel in a tone that plainly indicated her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) painful doubts. '' Only don't say I didn't warn you if he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) burns Green Gables down or puts strychnine in the well --I heard of a case over in New Brunswick where an orphan asylum child did that and the whole family died in fearful agonies. Only, it was a girl in that instance.'' <div class="bookquote">``Well, we're not getting a girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, as if poisoning wells were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case of a boy. <div class="bookquote">``I'd never dream of taking a girl to bring up. I wonder at Mrs. Alexander Spencer for doing it. But there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) wouldn't shrink from adopting a whole orphan asylum if she (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) took it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) head.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lynde/Mrs. Rachel/Rachel</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Rachel would have liked to stay until Matthew came home with his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) imported orphan. But reflecting that it would be a good two hours at least before his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) arrival she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) concluded to go up the road to Robert Bell's and tell the news. It would certainly make a sensation second to none, and Mrs. Rachel dearly loved to make a sensation. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) took herself away, somewhat to Marilla's relief, for the latter felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) doubts and fears reviving under the influence of Mrs. Rachel's pessimism. '' Well, of all things that ever were or will be!'' ejaculated Mrs. Rachel when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) was safely out in the lane. <div class="bookquote">``It does really seem as if I must be dreaming. Well, I'm sorry for that poor young one and no mistake. Matthew and Marilla don't know anything about children and they'll expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) to be wiser and steadier that his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) own grandfather, if so be's he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) ever had a grandfather, which is doubtful. It seems uncanny to think of a child at Green Gables somehow; there's never been one there, for Matthew and Marilla were grown up when the new house was built--if they ever were children, which is hard to believe when one looks at them. I wouldn't be in that orphan's shoes for anything. My, but I pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>), that's what.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lynde/Mrs. Rachel/Rachel</b></font>)</div>So said Mrs. Rachel to the wild rose bushes out of the fulness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) heart; but if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) could have seen the child who was waiting patiently at the Bright River station at that very moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) pity would have been still deeper and more profound. CHAPTER II. Matthew Cuthbert is surprised |MATTHEW Cuthbert and the sorrel mare jogged comfortably over the eight miles to Bright River.
<p/>It was a pretty road, running along between snug farmsteads, with now and again a bit of balsamy fir wood to drive through or a hollow where wild plums hung out their filmy bloom. The air was sweet with the breath of many apple orchards and the meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple; while <div class="bookquote">``The little birds sang as if it were The one day of summer in all the year. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>Matthew enjoyed the drive after his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) own fashion, except during the moments when he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) met women and had to nod to them--for in Prince Edward island you are supposed to nod to all and sundry you meet on the road whether you know them or not. Matthew dreaded all women except Marilla and Mrs. Rachel; he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had an uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) may have been quite right in thinking so, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was an odd-looking personage, with an ungainly figure and long iron-gray hair that touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) stooping shoulders, and a full, soft brown beard which he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had worn ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was twenty. In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had looked at twenty very much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) looked at sixty, lacking a little of the grayness. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) reached Bright River there was no sign of any train; he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was too early, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) tied his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) horse in the yard of the small Bright River hotel and went over to the station house. The long platform was almost deserted; the only living creature in sight being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end. Matthew, barely noting that it was a girl, sidled past her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as quickly as possible without looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) looked he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) could hardly have failed to notice the tense rigidity and expectation of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) attitude and expression. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was sitting there waiting for something or somebody and, since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat and waited with all her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might and main. Matthew encountered the stationmaster locking up the ticket office preparatory to going home for supper, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) if the five-thirty train would soon be along. '' The five-thirty train has been in and gone half an hour ago,'' answered that brisk official. <div class="bookquote">``But there was a passenger dropped off for you--a little girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s sitting out there on the shingles. I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to go into the ladies' waiting room, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) informed me gravely that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) preferred to stay outside. ' There was more scope for imagination,' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s a case, I should say.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm not expecting a girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew blankly. <div class="bookquote">``It's a boy I've come for. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) should be here. Mrs. Alexander Spencer was to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) over from Nova Scotia for me.''  (<font color='red'><b>The stationmaster</b></font>)</div>The stationmaster whistled. '' Guess there's some mistake,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) said. '' Mrs. Spencer came off the train with that girl and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) into my charge. Said you and your sister were adopting her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) presently. That's all I know about it--and I haven't got any more orphans concealed hereabouts.'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew helplessly, wishing that Marilla was at hand to cope with the situation. '' Well, you'd better question the girl,'' said the station-master carelessly. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll be able to explain--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s got a tongue of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own, that's certain. Maybe they were out of boys of the brand you wanted.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) walked jauntily away, being hungry, and the unfortunate Matthew was left to do that which was harder for him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) than bearding a lion in its den--walk up to a girl--a strange girl--an orphan girl--and demand of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) why she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wasn't a boy. Matthew groaned in spirit as he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) turned about and shuffled gently down the platform towards her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had passed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) now. Matthew was not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and would not have seen what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was really like if he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had been, but an ordinary observer would have seen this: A child of about eleven, garbed in a very short, very tight, very ugly dress of yellowish-gray wincey. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat, extending down her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back, were two braids of very thick, decidedly red hair. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face was small, white and thin, also much freckled; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mouth was large and so were her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes, which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others. So far, the ordinary observer; an extraordinary observer might have seen that the chin was very pointed and pronounced; that the big eyes were full of spirit and vivacity; that the mouth was sweet-lipped and expressive; that the forehead was broad and full; in short, our discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded that no commonplace soul inhabited the body of this stray woman-child of whom shy Matthew Cuthbert was so ludicrously afraid. Matthew, however, was spared the ordeal of speaking first, for as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman-child</b></font>) concluded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman-child</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>woman-child</b></font>) stood up, grasping with one thin brown hand the handle of a shabby, old-fashioned carpet-bag; the other she (<font color='blue'><b>woman-child</b></font>) held out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you are Mr. Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) said in a peculiarly clear, sweet voice. <div class="bookquote">``I'm very glad to see you. I was beginning to be afraid you weren't coming for me and I was imagining all the things that might have happened to prevent you. I had made up my mind that if you didn't come for me to-night I'd go down the track to that big wild cherry-tree at the bend, and climb up into it to stay all night. I wouldn't be a bit afraid, and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry-tree all white with bloom in the moonshine, don't you think? You could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls, couldn't you? And I was quite sure you would come for me in the morning, if you didn't to-night. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>Matthew had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>); then and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) decided what to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) could not tell this child with the glowing eyes that there had been a mistake; he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) would take her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) home and let Marilla do that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) couldn't be left at Bright River anyhow, no matter what mistake had been made, so all questions and explanations might as well be deferred until he (<font color='blue'><b>Bright</b></font>) was safely back at Green Gables. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry I was late,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) said shyly. '' Come along. The horse is over in the yard. Give me your bag.'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I can carry it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>the child responded cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``It isn't heavy. I've got all my worldly goods in it, but it isn't heavy. And if it isn't carried in just a certain way the handle pulls out--so I'd better keep it because I know the exact knack of it. It's an extremely old carpet-bag.
<p/>Oh, I'm very glad you've come, even if it would have been nice to sleep in a wild cherry-tree. We've got to drive a long piece, haven't we? Mrs. Spencer said it was eight miles. I'm glad because I love driving. Oh, it seems so wonderful that I'm going to live with you and belong to you. I've never belonged to anybody--not really. But the asylum was the worst. I've only been in it four months, but that was enough. I don't suppose you ever were an orphan in an asylum, so you can't possibly understand what it is like. It's worse than anything you could imagine. Mrs. Spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that, but I didn't mean to be wicked. It's so easy to be wicked without knowing it, isn't it? They were good, you know--the asylum people. But there is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum--only just in the other orphans. It was pretty interesting to imagine things about them--to imagine that perhaps the girl who sat next to you was really the daughter of a belted earl, who had been stolen away from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) parents in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could confess. I used to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that, because I didn't have time in the day. I guess that's why I'm so thin --I am dreadful thin, ain't I? There isn't a pick on my bones. I do love to imagine I'm nice and plump, with dimples in my elbows.''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>With this Matthew's companion stopped talking, partly because she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was out of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy.
<p/>Not another word did she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) say until they had left the village and were driving down a steep little hill, the road part of which had been cut so deeply into the soft soil, that the banks, fringed with blooming wild cherry-trees and slim white birches, were several feet above their heads. The child put out her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that brushed against the side of the buggy. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't that beautiful? What did that tree, leaning out from the bank, all white and lacy, make you think of? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) asked. '' Well now, I dunno,'' said Matthew. <div class="bookquote">``Why, a bride, of course--a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil. I've never seen one, but I can imagine what she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) would look like. I don't ever expect to be a bride myself. I'm so homely nobody will ever want to marry me--unless it might be a foreign missionary. I suppose a foreign missionary mightn't be very particular. But I do hope that some day I shall have a white dress. That is my highest ideal of earthly bliss. I just love pretty clothes. And I've never had a pretty dress in my life that I can remember-- but of course it's all the more to look forward to, isn't it? And then I can imagine that I'm dressed gorgeously. This morning when I left the asylum I felt so ashamed because I had to wear this horrid old wincey dress. All the orphans had to wear them, you know. A merchant in Hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of wincey to the asylum. Some people said it was because he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) couldn't sell it, but I'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) heart, wouldn't you?
<p/>When we got on the train I felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me. But I just went to work and imagined that I had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress--because when you are imagining you might as well imagine something worth while--and a big hat all flowers and nodding plumes, and a gold watch, and kid gloves and boots. I felt cheered up right away and I enjoyed my trip to the Island with all my might. I wasn't a bit sick coming over in the boat. Neither was Mrs. Spencer although she (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) generally is. She (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) hadn't time to get sick, watching to see that I didn't fall overboard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) never saw the beat of me for prowling about. But if it kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) from being seasick it's a mercy I did prowl, isn't it? And I wanted to see everything that was to be seen on that boat, because I didn't know whether I'd ever have another opportunity. Oh, there are a lot more cherry-trees all in bloom! This Island is the bloomiest place. I just love it already, and I'm so glad I'm going to live here. I've always heard that Prince Edward Island was the prettiest place in the world, and I used to imagine I was living here, but I never really expected I would. It's delightful when your imaginations come true, isn't it? But those red roads are so funny. When we got into the train at Charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past I asked Mrs. Spencer what made them red and she (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) didn't know and for pity's sake not to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) any more questions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) said I must have asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) a thousand already.
<p/>I suppose I had, too, but how you going to find out about things if you don't ask questions? And what does make the roads red?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well now, I dunno,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew. '' Well, that is one of the things to find out sometime. Isn't it splendid to think of all the things there are to find out about? It just makes me feel glad to be alive--it's such an interesting world. It wouldn't be half so interesting if we know all about everything, would it? There'd be no scope for imagination then, would there? But am I talking too much? People are always telling me I do. Would you rather I didn't talk? If you say so I'll stop. I can stop when I make up my mind to it, although it's difficult. '' Matthew, much to his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) own surprise, was enjoying himself. Like most quiet folks he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) to keep up his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) end of it. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had never expected to enjoy the society of a little girl. Women were bad enough in all conscience, but little girls were worse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) detested the way they had of sidling past him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) timidly, with sidewise glances, as if they expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a word. That was the Avonlea type of well-bred little girl. But this freckled witch was very different, and although he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) found it rather difficult for his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) slower intelligence to keep up with her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) brisk mental processes he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``kind of liked her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) chatter. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) said as shyly as usual: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you can talk as much as you like. I don't mind.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm so glad.
<p/>I know you and I are going to get along together fine. It's such a relief to talk when one wants to and not be told that children should be seen and not heard. I've had that said to me a million times if I have once. And people laugh at me because I use big words. But if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express them, haven't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well now, that seems reasonable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew. '' Mrs. Spencer said that my tongue must be hung in the middle. But it isn't--it's firmly fastened at one end. Mrs. Spencer said your place was named Green Gables. I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) all about it. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) said there were trees all around it. I was gladder than ever. I just love trees. And there weren't any at all about the asylum, only a few poor weeny-teeny things out in front with little whitewashed cagey things about them. They just looked like orphans themselves, those trees did. It used to make me want to cry to look at them. I used to say to them, `Oh, you poor little things! If you were out in a great big woods with other trees all around you and little mosses and June bells growing over your roots and a brook not far away and birds singing in you branches, you could grow, couldn't you? But you can't where you are. I know just exactly how you feel, little trees.' I felt sorry to leave them behind this morning. You do get so attached to things like that, don't you? Is there a brook anywhere near Green Gables? I forgot to ask Mrs. Spencer that.'' <div class="bookquote">``Well now, yes, there's one right below the house.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fancy.
<p/>It's always been one of my dreams to live near a brook. I never expected I would, though. Dreams don't often come true, do they? Wouldn't it be nice if they did? But just now I feel pretty nearly perfectly happy. I can't feel exactly perfectly happy because--well, what color would you call this? ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) twitched one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) long glossy braids over her (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) thin shoulder and held it up before Matthew's eyes. Matthew was not used to deciding on the tints of ladies' tresses, but in this case there couldn't be much doubt. <div class="bookquote">``It's red, ain't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) said. The girl let the braid drop back with a sigh that seemed to come from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) very toes and to exhale forth all the sorrows of the ages. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's red,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said resignedly. '' Now you see why I can't be perfectly happy. Nobody could who has red hair. I don't mind the other things so much--the freckles and the green eyes and my skinniness. I can imagine them away. I can imagine that I have a beautiful rose-leaf complexion and lovely starry violet eyes. But I cannot imagine that red hair away. I do my best. I think to myself, `Now my hair is a glorious black, black as the raven's wing.' But all the time I know it is just plain red and it breaks my heart. It will be my lifelong sorrow. I read of a girl once in a novel who had a lifelong sorrow but it wasn't red hair. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair was pure gold rippling back from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) alabaster brow. What is an alabaster brow? I never could find out. Can you tell me?'' <div class="bookquote">``Well now, I'm afraid I can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew, who was getting a little dizzy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) felt as he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had once felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) rash youth when another boy had enticed him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) on the merry-go-round at a picnic. '' Well, whatever it was it must have been something nice because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was divinely beautiful. Have you ever imagined what it must feel like to be divinely beautiful?'' <div class="bookquote">``Well now, no, I haven't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>confessed Matthew ingenuously. <div class="bookquote">``I have, often. Which would you rather be if you had the choice--divinely beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically good?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well now, I--I don't know exactly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Neither do I. I can never decide. But it doesn't make much real difference for it isn't likely I'll ever be either. It's certain I'll never be angelically good. Mrs. Spencer says-- oh, Mr. Cuthbert! Oh, Mr. Cuthbert!! Oh, Mr. Cuthbert!!! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Spencer/Mrs. Alexander Spencer/Spencer</b></font>)</div>That was not what Mrs. Spencer had said; neither had the child tumbled out of the buggy nor had Matthew done anything astonishing. They had simply rounded a curve in the road and found themselves in the <div class="bookquote">``Avenue. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The <div class="bookquote">``Avenue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newbridge</b></font>)</div>so called by the Newbridge people, was a stretch of road four or five hundred yards long, completely arched over with huge, wide-spreading apple-trees, planted years ago by an eccentric old farmer. Overhead was one long canopy of snowy fragrant bloom. Below the boughs the air was full of a purple twilight and far ahead a glimpse of painted sunset sky shone like a great rose window at the end of a cathedral aisle. Its beauty seemed to strike the child dumb. She (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) leaned back in the buggy, her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) thin hands clasped before her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) face lifted rapturously to the white splendor above. Even when they had passed out and were driving down the long slope to Newbridge she (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) never moved or spoke.
<p/>Still with rapt face she (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) gazed afar into the sunset west, with eyes that saw visions trooping splendidly across that glowing background. Through Newbridge, a bustling little village where dogs barked at them and small boys hooted and curious faces peered from the windows, they drove, still in silence. When three more miles had dropped away behind them the child had not spoken. She (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) could keep silence, it was evident, as energetically as she (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) could talk. <div class="bookquote">``I guess you're feeling pretty tired and hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>Matthew ventured to say at last, accounting for her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) long visitation of dumbness with the only reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) could think of. <div class="bookquote">``But we haven't very far to go now--only another mile.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) came out of her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) reverie with a deep sigh and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) with the dreamy gaze of a soul that had been wondering afar, star-led. '' Oh, Mr. Cuthbert,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``that place we came through--that white place--what was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well now, you must mean the Avenue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew after a few moments' profound reflection. <div class="bookquote">``It is a kind of pretty place.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pretty? Oh, pretty doesn't seem the right word to use. Nor beautiful, either. They don't go far enough. Oh, it was wonderful--wonderful. It's the first thing I ever saw that couldn't be improved upon by imagination. It just satisfies me here'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) put one hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) breast--<div class="bookquote">``it made a queer funny ache and yet it was a pleasant ache. Did you ever have an ache like that, Mr. Cuthbert?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well now, I just can't recollect that I ever had.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have it lots of time--whenever I see anything royally beautiful. But they shouldn't call that lovely place the Avenue. There is no meaning in a name like that. They should call it--let me see--the White Way of Delight.
<p/>Isn't that a nice imaginative name? When I don't like the name of a place or a person I always imagine a new one and always think of them so. There was a girl at the asylum whose name was Hepzibah Jenkins, but I always imagined her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as Rosalia DeVere. Other people may call that place the Avenue, but I shall always call it the White Way of Delight. Have we really only another mile to go before we get home? I'm glad and I'm sorry. I'm sorry because this drive has been so pleasant and I'm always sorry when pleasant things end. Something still pleasanter may come after, but you can never be sure. And it's so often the case that it isn't pleasanter. That has been my experience anyhow. But I'm glad to think of getting home. You see, I've never had a real home since I can remember. It gives me that pleasant ache again just to think of coming to a really truly home. Oh, isn't that pretty! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They had driven over the crest of a hill. Below them was a pond, looking almost like a river so long and winding was it. A bridge spanned it midway and from there to its lower end, where an amber-hued belt of sand-hills shut it in from the dark blue gulf beyond, the water was a glory of many shifting hues--the most spiritual shadings of crocus and rose and ethereal green, with other elusive tintings for which no name has ever been found. Above the bridge the pond ran up into fringing groves of fir and maple and lay all darkly translucent in their wavering shadows. Here and there a wild plum leaned out from the bank like a white-clad girl tip-toeing to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own reflection.
<p/>From the marsh at the head of the pond came the clear, mournfully-sweet chorus of the frogs. There was a little gray house peering around a white apple orchard on a slope beyond and, although it was not yet quite dark, a light was shining from one of its windows. <div class="bookquote">``That's Barry's pond,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't like that name, either. I shall call it--let me see--the Lake of Shining Waters. Yes, that is the right name for it. I know because of the thrill. When I hit on a name that suits exactly it gives me a thrill. Do things ever give you a thrill?''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>Matthew ruminated. '' Well now, yes. It always kind of gives me a thrill to see them ugly white grubs that spade up in the cucumber beds. I hate the look of them.'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't think that can be exactly the same kind of a thrill. Do you think it can? There doesn't seem to be much connection between grubs and lakes of shining waters, does there? But why do other people call it Barry's pond?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I reckon because Mr. Barry lives up there in that house. Orchard Slope's the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) place. If it wasn't for that big bush behind it you could see Green Gables from here.

So I shut my eyes. But I always have to open them for all when I think we're getting near the middle. Because, you see, if the bridge did crumple up I'd want to see it crumple. What a jolly rumble it makes! I always like the rumble part of it. Isn't it splendid there are so many things to like in this world? There we're over. Now I'll look back. Good night, dear Lake of Shining Waters. I always say good night to the things I love, just as I would to people. I think they like it. That water looks as if it was smiling at me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>When they had driven up the further hill and around a corner Matthew said: <div class="bookquote">``We're pretty near home now. That's Green Gables over--''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) interrupted breathlessly, catching at his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) partially raised arm and shutting her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) eyes that she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) might not see his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) gesture. '' Let me guess. I'm sure I'll guess right. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) eyes and looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>). They were on the crest of a hill. The sun had set some time since, but the landscape was still clear in the mellow afterlight. To the west a dark church spire rose up against a marigold sky.
<p/>Below was a little valley and beyond a long, gently-rising slope with snug farmsteads scattered along it. From one to another the child's eyes darted, eager and wistful. At last they lingered on one away to the left, far back from the road, dimly white with blossoming trees in the twilight of the surrounding woods. Over it, in the stainless southwest sky, a great crystal-white star was shining like a lamp of guidance and promise. <div class="bookquote">``That's it, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said, pointing. Matthew slapped the reins on the sorrel's back delightedly. '' Well now, you've guessed it! But I reckon Mrs. Spencer described it so's you could tell.'' <div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) didn't--really she (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) didn't. All she (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) said might just as well have been about most of those other places. I hadn't any real idea what it looked like. But just as soon as I saw it I felt it was home. Oh, it seems as if I must be in a dream. Do you know, my arm must be black and blue from the elbow up, for I've pinched myself so many times today. Every little while a horrible sickening feeling would come over me and I'd be so afraid it was all a dream. Then I'd pinch myself to see if it was real--until suddenly I remembered that even supposing it was only a dream I'd better go on dreaming as long as I could; so I stopped pinching. But it is real and we're nearly home.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>With a sigh of rapture she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) relapsed into silence. Matthew stirred uneasily. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) felt glad that it would be Marilla and not he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) who would have to tell this waif of the world that the home she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) longed for was not to be hers after all.
<p/>They drove over Lynde's Hollow, where it was already quite dark, but not so dark that Mrs. Rachel could not see them from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) window vantage, and up the hill and into the long lane of Green Gables. By the time they arrived at the house Matthew was shrinking from the approaching revelation with an energy he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) did not understand. It was not of Marilla or himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was thinking of the trouble this mistake was probably going to make for them, but of the child's disappointment. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) thought of that rapt light being quenched in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had an uncomfortable feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was going to assist at murdering something--much the same feeling that came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had to kill a lamb or calf or any other innocent little creature. The yard was quite dark as they turned into it and the poplar leaves were rustling silkily all round it. '' Listen to the trees talking in their sleep,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) whispered, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) to the ground. '' What nice dreams they must have!'' Then, holding tightly to the carpet-bag which contained <div class="bookquote">``all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) worldly goods,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) into the house. CHAPTER III. Marilla Cuthbert is Surprised |MARILLA came briskly forward as Matthew opened the door. But when her (<font color='blue'><b>MARILLA</b></font>) eyes fell on the odd little figure in the stiff, ugly dress, with the long braids of red hair and the eager, luminous eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>MARILLA</b></font>) stopped short in amazement. '' Matthew Cuthbert, who's that? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>MARILLA</b></font>) ejaculated. <div class="bookquote">``Where is the boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There wasn't any boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew wretchedly. <div class="bookquote">``There was only her (<font color='blue'><b>MARILLA</b></font>) .''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) nodded at the child, remembering that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had never even asked her (<font color='blue'><b>MARILLA</b></font>) name. '' No boy! But there must have been a boy,'' insisted Marilla.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We sent word to Mrs. Spencer to bring a boy.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) didn't. She (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) . I asked the station-master. And I had to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) couldn't be left there, no matter where the mistake had come in.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, this is a pretty piece of business!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Marilla. During this dialogue the child had remained silent, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) eyes roving from one to the other, all the animation fading out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) face. Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) seemed to grasp the full meaning of what had been said. Dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) precious carpet-bag she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) sprang forward a step and clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``You don't want me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``You don't want me because I'm not a boy! I might have expected it. Nobody ever did want me. I might have known it was all too beautiful to last. I might have known nobody really did want me. Oh, what shall I do? I'm going to burst into tears!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Burst into tears she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) did. Sitting down on a chair by the table, flinging her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) arms out upon it, and burying her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) face in them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) proceeded to cry stormily. Marilla and Matthew looked at each other deprecatingly across the stove. Neither of them knew what to say or do. Finally Marilla stepped lamely into the breach. '' Well, well, there's no need to cry so about it.'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, there is need!''  (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div>The child raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) head quickly, revealing a tear-stained face and trembling lips. '' You would cry, too, if you were an orphan and had come to a place you thought was going to be home and found that they didn't want you because you weren't a boy. Oh, this is the most tragical thing that ever happened to me!''
<p/>Something like a reluctant smile, rather rusty from long disuse, mellowed Marilla's grim expression. '' Well, don't cry any more. We're not going to turn you out-of-doors to-night. You'll have to stay here until we investigate this affair. What's your name? '' The child hesitated for a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Will you please call me Cordelia? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cordelia</b></font>) said eagerly. '' Call you Cordelia? Is that your name?'' <div class="bookquote">``No-o-o, it's not exactly my name, but I would love to be called Cordelia. It's such a perfectly elegant name.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what on earth you mean. If Cordelia isn't your name, what is?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Anne Shirley,''  (<font color='red'><b>the owner</b></font>)</div>reluctantly faltered forth the owner of that name, <div class="bookquote">``but, oh, please do call me Cordelia.

(<font color='red'><b>the owner</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Unromantic fiddlesticks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said the unsympathetic Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``Anne is a real good plain sensible name.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm not ashamed of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>explained Anne, '' only I like Cordelia better. I've always imagined that my name was Cordelia--at least, I always have of late years. When I was young I used to imagine it was Geraldine, but I like Cordelia better now. But if you call me Anne please call me Anne spelled with an E.'' <div class="bookquote">``What difference does it make how it's spelled?

It looks so much nicer. When you hear a name pronounced can't you always see it in your mind, just as if it was printed out?

<p/>If you'll only call me Anne spelled with an E I shall try to reconcile myself to not being called Cordelia.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well, then, Anne spelled with an E, can you tell us how this mistake came to be made?

But Mrs. Spencer said distinctly that you wanted a girl about eleven years old. And the matron said she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) thought I would do.

Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) added reproachfully, turning to Matthew, <div class="bookquote">``why didn't you tell me at the station that you didn't want me and leave me there?

(<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What on earth does she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) mean? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>demanded Marilla, staring at Matthew. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s just referring to some conversation we had on the road,'' said Matthew hastily. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going out to put the mare in, Marilla. Have tea ready when I come back.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did Mrs. Spencer bring anybody over besides you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>continued Marilla when Matthew had gone out. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) brought Lily Jones for herself. Lily is only five years old and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) is very beautiful and had nut-brown hair. If I was very beautiful and had nut-brown hair would you keep me?'' <div class="bookquote">``No. We want a boy to help Matthew on the farm. A girl would be of no use to us. Take off your hat. I'll lay it and your bag on the hall table. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hat meekly. Matthew came back presently and they sat down to supper. But Anne could not eat.
<p/>In vain she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) nibbled at the bread and butter and pecked at the crab-apple preserve out of the little scalloped glass dish by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) plate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not really make any headway at all. <div class="bookquote">``You're not eating anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla sharply, eying her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) as if it were a serious shortcoming. Anne sighed. <div class="bookquote">``I can't. I'm in the depths of despair. Can you eat when you are in the depths of despair?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I've never been in the depths of despair, so I can't say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>responded Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``Weren't you? Well, did you ever try to imagine you were in the depths of despair?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I didn't.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then I don't think you can understand what it's like. It's a very uncomfortable feeling indeed. When you try to eat a lump comes right up in your throat and you can't swallow anything, not even if it was a chocolate caramel. I had one chocolate caramel once two years ago and it was simply delicious. I've often dreamed since then that I had a lot of chocolate caramels, but I always wake up just when I'm going to eat them. I do hope you won't be offended because I can't eat. Everything is extremely nice, but still I cannot eat.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I guess she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew, who hadn't spoken since his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) return from the barn. <div class="bookquote">``Best put her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to bed, Marilla. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla had been wondering where Anne should be put to bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had prepared a couch in the kitchen chamber for the desired and expected boy. But, although it was neat and clean, it did not seem quite the thing to put a girl there somehow. But the spare room was out of the question for such a stray waif, so there remained only the east gable room.
<p/>Marilla lighted a candle and told Anne to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>), which Anne spiritlessly did, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hat and carpet-bag from the hall table as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) passed. The hall was fearsomely clean; the little gable chamber in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) presently found herself seemed still cleaner. Marilla set the candle on a three-legged, three-cornered table and turned down the bedclothes. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you have a nightgown? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) questioned. Anne nodded. '' Yes, I have two. The matron of the asylum made them for me. They're fearfully skimpy. There is never enough to go around in an asylum, so things are always skimpy--at least in a poor asylum like ours. I hate skimpy night-dresses. But one can dream just as well in them as in lovely trailing ones, with frills around the neck, that's one consolation.'' <div class="bookquote">``Well, undress as quick as you can and go to bed. I'll come back in a few minutes for the candle. I daren't trust you to put it out yourself. You'd likely set the place on fire. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>When Marilla had gone Anne looked around her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wistfully. The whitewashed walls were so painfully bare and staring that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought they must ache over their own bareness. The floor was bare, too, except for a round braided mat in the middle such as Anne had never seen before. In one corner was the bed, a high, old-fashioned one, with four dark, low-turned posts. In the other corner was the aforesaid three-corner table adorned with a fat, red velvet pin-cushion hard enough to turn the point of the most adventurous pin. Above it hung a little six-by-eight mirror. Midway between table and bed was the window, with an icy white muslin frill over it, and opposite it was the wash-stand.
<p/>The whole apartment was of a rigidity not to be described in words, but which sent a shiver to the very marrow of Anne's bones. With a sob she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hastily discarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) garments, put on the skimpy nightgown and sprang into bed where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) burrowed face downward into the pillow and pulled the clothes over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head. When Marilla came up for the light various skimpy articles of raiment scattered most untidily over the floor and a certain tempestuous appearance of the bed were the only indications of any presence save her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) deliberately picked up Anne's clothes, placed them neatly on a prim yellow chair, and then, taking up the candle, went over to the bed. '' Good night,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, a little awkwardly, but not unkindly. Anne's white face and big eyes appeared over the bedclothes with a startling suddenness. <div class="bookquote">``How can you call it a good night when you know it must be the very worst night I've ever had?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said reproachfully. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) dived down into invisibility again. Marilla went slowly down to the kitchen and proceeded to wash the supper dishes. Matthew was smoking--a sure sign of perturbation of mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) seldom smoked, for Marilla set her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) face against it as a filthy habit; but at certain times and seasons he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) felt driven to it and them Marilla winked at the practice, realizing that a mere man must have some vent for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) emotions. <div class="bookquote">``Well, this is a pretty kettle of fish,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) said wrathfully. <div class="bookquote">``This is what comes of sending word instead of going ourselves. Richard Spencer's folks have twisted that message somehow. One of us will have to drive over and see Mrs. Spencer tomorrow, that's certain. This girl will have to be sent back to the asylum.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I suppose so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew reluctantly. <div class="bookquote">``You suppose so!

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Matthew Cuthbert, you don't mean to say you think we ought to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla's astonishment could not have been greater if Matthew had expressed a predilection for standing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) head. '' Well, now, no, I suppose not--not exactly,'' stammered Matthew, uncomfortably driven into a corner for his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) precise meaning. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose--we could hardly be expected to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>).''

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) can talk fast enough. I saw that at once.

I don't want an orphan girl and if I did she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) isn't the style I'd pick out. There's something I don't understand about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). No, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s got to be despatched straight-way back to where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came from.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I could hire a French boy to help me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'d be company for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm not suffering for company,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla shortly. <div class="bookquote">``And I'm not going to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well now, it's just as you say, of course, Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew rising and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) pipe away. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to bed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>To bed went Matthew.
<p/>And to bed, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had put her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) dishes away, went Marilla, frowning most resolutely. And up-stairs, in the east gable, a lonely, heart-hungry, friendless child cried herself to sleep. CHAPTER IV. Morning at Green Gables |IT was broad daylight when Anne awoke and sat up in bed, staring confusedly at the window through which a flood of cheery sunshine was pouring and outside of which something white and feathery waved across glimpses of blue sky. For a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not remember where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was. First came a delightful thrill, as something very pleasant; then a horrible remembrance. This was Green Gables and they didn't want her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wasn't a boy! But it was morning and, yes, it was a cherry-tree in full bloom outside of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) window. With a bound she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was out of bed and across the floor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) pushed up the sash--it went up stiffly and creakily, as if it hadn't been opened for a long time, which was the case; and it stuck so tight that nothing was needed to hold it up. Anne dropped on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knees and gazed out into the June morning, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes glistening with delight. Oh, wasn't it beautiful? Wasn't it a lovely place? Suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wasn't really going to stay here! She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would imagine she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was. There was scope for imagination here. A huge cherry-tree grew outside, so close that its boughs tapped against the house, and it was so thick-set with blossoms that hardly a leaf was to be seen. On both sides of the house was a big orchard, one of apple-trees and one of cherry-trees, also showered over with blossoms; and their grass was all sprinkled with dandelions.
<p/>In the garden below were lilac-trees purple with flowers, and their dizzily sweet fragrance drifted up to the window on the morning wind. Below the garden a green field lush with clover sloped down to the hollow where the brook ran and where scores of white birches grew, upspringing airily out of an undergrowth suggestive of delightful possibilities in ferns and mosses and woodsy things generally. Beyond it was a hill, green and feathery with spruce and fir; there was a gap in it where the gray gable end of the little house she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had seen from the other side of the Lake of Shining Waters was visible. Off to the left were the big barns and beyond them, away down over green, low-sloping fields, was a sparkling blue glimpse of sea. Anne's beauty-loving eyes lingered on it all, taking everything greedily in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had looked on so many unlovely places in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) life, poor child; but this was as lovely as anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had ever dreamed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knelt there, lost to everything but the loveliness around her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), until she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was startled by a hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) shoulder. Marilla had come in unheard by the small dreamer. <div class="bookquote">``It's time you were dressed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) said curtly. Marilla really did not know how to talk to the child, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) uncomfortable ignorance made her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) crisp and curt when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) did not mean to be. Anne stood up and drew a long breath. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, isn't it wonderful?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, waving her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand comprehensively at the good world outside. <div class="bookquote">``It's a big tree,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, <div class="bookquote">``and it blooms great, but the fruit don't amount to much never--small and wormy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't mean just the tree; of course it's lovely--yes, it's radiantly lovely--it blooms as if it meant it--but I meant everything, the garden and the orchard and the brook and the woods, the whole big dear world. Don't you feel as if you just loved the world on a morning like this? And I can hear the brook laughing all the way up here. Have you ever noticed what cheerful things brooks are? They're always laughing. Even in winter-time I've heard them under the ice. I'm so glad there's a brook near Green Gables. Perhaps you think it doesn't make any difference to me when you're not going to keep me, but it does. I shall always like to remember that there is a brook at Green Gables even if I never see it again. If there wasn't a brook I'd be haunted by the uncomfortable feeling that there ought to be one. I'm not in the depths of despair this morning. I never can be in the morning. Isn't it a splendid thing that there are mornings? But I feel very sad. I've just been imagining that it was really me you wanted after all and that I was to stay here for ever and ever. It was a great comfort while it lasted. But the worst of imagining things is that the time comes when you have to stop and that hurts.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You'd better get dressed and come down-stairs and never mind your imaginings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) could get a word in edgewise. <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast is waiting. Wash your face and comb your hair. Leave the window up and turn your bedclothes back over the foot of the bed. Be as smart as you can.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne could evidently be smart to some purpose for she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was down-stairs in ten minutes' time, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) clothes neatly on, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hair brushed and braided, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face washed, and a comfortable consciousness pervading her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) soul that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had fulfilled all Marilla's requirements. As a matter of fact, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had forgotten to turn back the bedclothes. <div class="bookquote">``I'm pretty hungry this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) announced as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) slipped into the chair Marilla placed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The world doesn't seem such a howling wilderness as it did last night. I'm so glad it's a sunshiny morning. But I like rainy mornings real well, too. All sorts of mornings are interesting, don't you think? You don't know what's going to happen through the day, and there's so much scope for imagination. But I'm glad it's not rainy today because it's easier to be cheerful and bear up under affliction on a sunshiny day. I feel that I have a good deal to bear up under. It's all very well to read about sorrows and imagine yourself living through them heroically, but it's not so nice when you really come to have them, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``For pity's sake hold your tongue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``You talk entirely too much for a little girl.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Thereupon Anne held her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tongue so obediently and thoroughly that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) continued silence made Marilla rather nervous, as if in the presence of something not exactly natural. Matthew also held his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) tongue,--but this was natural,--so that the meal was a very silent one. As it progressed Anne became more and more abstracted, eating mechanically, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) big eyes fixed unswervingly and unseeingly on the sky outside the window.
<p/>This made Marilla more nervous than ever; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had an uncomfortable feeling that while this odd child's body might be there at the table her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) spirit was far away in some remote airy cloudland, borne aloft on the wings of imagination. Who would want such a child about the place? Yet Matthew wished to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>), of all unaccountable things! Marilla felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) wanted it just as much this morning as he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had the night before, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) would go on wanting it. That was Matthew's way--take a whim into his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) head and cling to it with the most amazing silent persistency--a persistency ten times more potent and effectual in its very silence than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had talked it out. When the meal was ended Anne came out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) reverie and offered to wash the dishes. '' Can you wash dishes right? '' asked Marilla distrustfully. '' Pretty well. I'm better at looking after children, though. I've had so much experience at that. It's such a pity you haven't any here for me to look after.'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't feel as if I wanted any more children to look after than I've got at present. You're problem enough in all conscience. What's to be done with you I don't know. Matthew is a most ridiculous man.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)'s lovely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne reproachfully. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) is so very sympathetic. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) didn't mind how much I talked--he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) seemed to like it.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're both queer enough, if that's what you mean by kindred spirits,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla with a sniff. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, you may wash the dishes. Take plenty of hot water, and be sure you dry them well.
<p/>I've got enough to attend to this morning for I'll have to drive over to White Sands in the afternoon and see Mrs. Spencer. You'll come with me and we'll settle what's to be done with you. After you've finished the dishes go up-stairs and make your bed. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne washed the dishes deftly enough, as Marilla who kept a sharp eye on the process, discerned. Later on she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) bed less successfully, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had never learned the art of wrestling with a feather tick. But is was done somehow and smoothed down; and then Marilla, to get rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>), told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) might go out-of-doors and amuse herself until dinner time. Anne flew to the door, face alight, eyes glowing. On the very threshold she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) stopped short, wheeled about, came back and sat down by the table, light and glow as effectually blotted out as if some one had clapped an extinguisher on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). '' What's the matter now? '' demanded Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``I don't dare go out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne, in the tone of a martyr relinquishing all earthly joys. <div class="bookquote">``If I can't stay here there is no use in my loving Green Gables. And if I go out there and get acquainted with all those trees and flowers and the orchard and the brook I'll not be able to help loving it. It's hard enough now, so I won't make it any harder. I want to go out so much--everything seems to be calling to me, `Anne, Anne, come out to us. Anne, Anne, we want a playmate'--but it's better not. There is no use in loving things if you have to be torn from them, is there? And it's so hard to keep from loving things, isn't it?
<p/>That was why I was so glad when I thought I was going to live here. I thought I'd have so many things to love and nothing to hinder me. But that brief dream is over. I am resigned to my fate now, so I don't think I'll go out for fear I'll get unresigned again. What is the name of that geranium on the window-sill, please?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's the apple-scented geranium.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't mean that sort of a name. I mean just a name you gave it yourself. Didn't you give it a name?

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Goodness, I don't care. But where on earth is the sense of naming a geranium?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I like things to have handles even if they are only geraniums. It makes them seem more like people. How do you know but that it hurts a geranium's feelings just to be called a geranium and nothing else? You wouldn't like to be called nothing but a woman all the time. Yes, I shall call it Bonny. I named that cherry-tree outside my bedroom window this morning. I called it Snow Queen because it was so white. Of course, it won't always be in blossom, but one can imagine that it is, can't one?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I never in all my life saw or heard anything to equal her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>muttered Marilla, beating a retreat down to the cellar after potatoes. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) is kind of interesting as Matthew says. I can feel already that I'm wondering what on earth she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'ll say next. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'ll be casting a spell over me, too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s cast it over Matthew. That look he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) gave me when he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) went out
<p/>said everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) said or hinted last night over again. I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was like other men and would talk things out. A body could answer back then and argue him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) into reason. But what's to be done with a man who just looks? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne had relapsed into reverie, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) chin in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes on the sky, when Marilla returned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) cellar pilgrimage. There Marilla left her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) until the early dinner was on the table. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose I can have the mare and buggy this afternoon, Matthew?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. Matthew nodded and looked wistfully at Anne. Marilla intercepted the look and said grimly: <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to drive over to White Sands and settle this thing. I'll take Anne with me and Mrs. Spencer will probably make arrangements to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) back to Nova Scotia at once. I'll set your tea out for you and I'll be home in time to milk the cows. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Still Matthew said nothing and Marilla had a sense of having wasted words and breath. There is nothing more aggravating than a man who won't talk back--unless it is a woman who won't. Matthew hitched the sorrel into the buggy in due time and Marilla and Anne set off. Matthew opened the yard gate for them and as they drove slowly through, he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) said, to nobody in particular as it seemed: <div class="bookquote">``Little Jerry Buote from the Creek was here this morning, and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Buote</b></font>) I guessed I'd hire him (<font color='blue'><b>Buote</b></font>) for the summer.''  (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div>Marilla made no reply, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) hit the unlucky sorrel such a vicious clip with the whip that the fat mare, unused to such treatment, whizzed indignantly down the lane at an alarming pace.
<p/>Marilla looked back once as the buggy bounced along and saw that aggravating Matthew leaning over the gate, looking wistfully after them. CHAPTER V. Anne's History |DO you know,'' said Anne confidentially, <div class="bookquote">``I've made up my mind to enjoy this drive. It's been my experience that you can nearly always enjoy things if you make up your mind firmly that you will. Of course, you must make it up firmly . I am not going to think about going back to the asylum while we're having our drive. I'm just going to think about the drive. Oh, look, there's one little early wild rose out! Isn't it lovely? Don't you think it must be glad to be a rose? Wouldn't it be nice if roses could talk? I'm sure they could tell us such lovely things. And isn't pink the most bewitching color in the world? I love it, but I can't wear it. Redheaded people can't wear pink, not even in imagination. Did you ever know of anybody whose hair was red when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was young, but got to be another color when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) grew up?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't know as I ever did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla mercilessly, <div class="bookquote">``and I shouldn't think it likely to happen in your case either. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Anne sighed. '' Well, that is another hope gone. ' My life is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes.' That's a sentence I read in a book once, and I say it over to comfort myself whenever I'm disappointed in anything.'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't see where the comforting comes in myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. '' Why, because it sounds so nice and romantic, just as if I were a heroine in a book, you know.
<p/>I am so fond of romantic things, and a graveyard full of buried hopes is about as romantic a thing as one can imagine isn't it? I'm rather glad I have one. Are we going across the Lake of Shining Waters today?'' <div class="bookquote">``We're not going over Barry's pond, if that's what you mean by your Lake of Shining Waters. We're going by the shore road.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Shore road sounds nice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne dreamily. <div class="bookquote">``Is it as nice as it sounds? Just when you said `shore road' I saw it in a picture in my mind, as quick as that! And White Sands is a pretty name, too; but I don't like it as well as Avonlea. Avonlea is a lovely name. It just sounds like music. How far is it to White Sands?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's five miles; and as you're evidently bent on talking you might as well talk to some purpose by telling me what you know about yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what I know about myself isn't really worth telling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``If you'll only let me tell you what I imagine about myself you'll think it ever so much more interesting.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't want any of your imaginings. Just you stick to bald facts. Begin at the beginning. Where were you born and how old are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was eleven last March,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne, resigning herself to bald facts with a little sigh. '' And I was born in Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia. My father's name was Walter Shirley, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was a teacher in the Bolingbroke High School. My mother's name was Bertha Shirley. Aren't Walter and Bertha lovely names? I'm so glad my parents had nice names. It would be a real disgrace to have a father named--well, say Jedediah, wouldn't it?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess it doesn't matter what a person's name is as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) behaves himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, feeling herself called upon to inculcate a good and useful moral. '' Well, I don't know. '' Anne looked thoughtful. <div class="bookquote">``I read in a book once that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but I've never been able to believe it. I don't believe a rose would be as nice if it was called a thistle or a skunk cabbage. I suppose my father could have been a good man even if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been called Jedediah; but I'm sure it would have been a cross. Well, my mother was a teacher in the High school, too, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) married father she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gave up teaching, of course. A husband was enough responsibility. Mrs. Thomas said that they were a pair of babies and as poor as church mice. They went to live in a weeny-teeny little yellow house in Bolingbroke. I've never seen that house, but I've imagined it thousands of times. I think it must have had honeysuckle over the parlor window and lilacs in the front yard and lilies of the valley just inside the gate. Yes, and muslin curtains in all the windows. Muslin curtains give a house such an air. I was born in that house. Mrs. Thomas said I was the homeliest baby she (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) ever saw , I was so scrawny and tiny and nothing but eyes, but that mother thought I was perfectly beautiful. I should think a mother would be a better judge than a poor woman who came in to scrub, wouldn't you? I'm glad she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was satisfied with me anyhow
<p/>, I would feel so sad if I thought I was a disappointment to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) didn't live very long after that, you see. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died of fever when I was just three months old. I do wish she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d lived long enough for me to remember calling her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother. I think it would be so sweet to say `mother,' don't you? And father died four days afterwards from fever too. That left me an orphan and folks were at their wits' end, so Mrs. Thomas said, what to do with me. You see, nobody wanted me even then. It seems to be my fate. Father and mother had both come from places far away and it was well known they hadn't any relatives living. Finally Mrs. Thomas said she (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)'d take me, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was poor and had a drunken husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) brought me up by hand. Do you know if there is anything in being brought up by hand that ought to make people who are brought up that way better than other people? Because whenever I was naughty Mrs. Thomas would ask me how I could be such a bad girl when she (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had brought me up by hand--reproachful-like. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mrs.</b></font>)</div>Mr. and Mrs. Thomas moved away from Bolingbroke to Marysville, and I lived with them until I was eight years old. I helped look after the Thomas children--there were four of them younger than me--and I can tell you they took a lot of looking after. Then Mr. Thomas was killed falling under a train and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) mother offered to take Mrs. Thomas and the children, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) didn't want me. Mrs. Thomas was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) wits' end, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) said, what to do with me.
<p/>Then Mrs. Hammond from up the river came down and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)'d take me, seeing I was handy with children, and I went up the river to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) in a little clearing among the stumps. It was a very lonesome place. I'm sure I could never have lived there if I hadn't had an imagination. Mr. Hammond worked a little sawmill up there, and Mrs. Hammond had eight children. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) had twins three times. I like babies in moderation, but twins three times in succession is too much . I told Mrs. Hammond so firmly, when the last pair came. I used to get so dreadfully tired carrying them about. <div class="bookquote">``I lived up river with Mrs. Hammond over two years, and then Mr. Hammond died and Mrs. Hammond broke up housekeeping. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) divided her (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) children among her (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) relatives and went to the States. I had to go to the asylum at Hopeton, because nobody would take me. They didn't want me at the asylum, either; they said they were over-crowded as it was. But they had to take me and I was there four months until Mrs. Spencer came. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne finished up with another sigh, of relief this time. Evidently she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not like talking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) experiences in a world that had not wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Did you ever go to school? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>demanded Marilla, turning the sorrel mare down the shore road. '' Not a great deal. I went a little the last year I stayed with Mrs. Thomas. When I went up river we were so far from a school that I couldn't walk it in winter and there was a vacation in summer, so I could only go in the spring and fall. But of course I went while I was at the asylum.
<p/>I can read pretty well and I know ever so many pieces of poetry off by heart--`The Battle of Hohenlinden' and `Edinburgh after Flodden,' and `Bingen of the Rhine,' and most of the `Lady of the Lake' and most of `The Seasons' by James Thompson. Don't you just love poetry that gives you a crinkly feeling up and down your back? There is a piece in the Fifth Reader--`The Downfall of Poland'--that is just full of thrills. Of course, I wasn't in the Fifth Reader--I was only in the Fourth--but the big girls used to lend me theirs to read.'' <div class="bookquote">``Were those women--Mrs. Thomas and Mrs. Hammond--good to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>asked Marilla, looking at Anne out of the corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eye. <div class="bookquote">``O-o-o-h,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>faltered Anne. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sensitive little face suddenly flushed scarlet and embarrassment sat on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) brow. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, they meant to be--I know they meant to be just as good and kind as possible. And when people mean to be good to you, you don't mind very much when they're not quite--always. They had a good deal to worry them, you know. It's a very trying to have a drunken husband, you see; and it must be very trying to have twins three times in succession, don't you think? But I feel sure they meant to be good to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla asked no more questions. Anne gave herself up to a silent rapture over the shore road and Marilla guided the sorrel abstractedly while she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) pondered deeply. Pity was suddenly stirring in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) heart for the child. What a starved, unloved life she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had had--a life of drudgery and poverty and neglect; for Marilla was shrewd enough to read between the lines of Anne's history and divine the truth.
<p/>No wonder she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been so delighted at the prospect of a real home. It was a pity she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had to be sent back. What if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), Marilla, should indulge Matthew's unaccountable whim and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) stay? He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was set on it; and the child seemed a nice, teachable little thing. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s got too much to say,'' thought Marilla, <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) might be trained out of that. And there's nothing rude or slangy in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) does say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s ladylike. It's likely her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) people were nice folks. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>The shore road was <div class="bookquote">``woodsy and wild and lonesome. ''  (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div>On the right hand, scrub firs, their spirits quite unbroken by long years of tussle with the gulf winds, grew thickly. On the left were the steep red sandstone cliffs, so near the track in places that a mare of less steadiness than the sorrel might have tried the nerves of the people behind her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>). Down at the base of the cliffs were heaps of surf-worn rocks or little sandy coves inlaid with pebbles as with ocean jewels; beyond lay the sea, shimmering and blue, and over it soared the gulls, their pinions flashing silvery in the sunlight. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't the sea wonderful?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne, rousing from a long, wide-eyed silence. '' Once, when I lived in Marysville, Mr. Thomas hired an express wagon and took us all to spend the day at the shore ten miles away. I enjoyed every moment of that day, even if I had to look after the children all the time. I lived it over in happy dreams for years. But this shore is nicer than the Marysville shore. Aren't those gulls splendid? Would you like to be a gull? I think I would--that is, if I couldn't be a human girl.
<p/>Don't you think it would be nice to wake up at sunrise and swoop down over the water and away out over that lovely blue all day; and then at night to fly back to one's nest?

Marilla Makes Up Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) Mind |GET there they did, however, in due season. Mrs. Spencer lived in a big yellow house at White Sands Cove, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) came to the door with surprise and welcome mingled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) benevolent face. <div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``you're the last folks I was looking for today, but I'm real glad to see you.

(<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm as well as can be expected, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne smilelessly. A blight seemed to have descended on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I suppose we'll stay a little while to rest the mare,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, <div class="bookquote">``but I promised Matthew I'd be home early. The fact is, Mrs. Spencer, there's been a queer mistake somewhere, and I've come over to see where it is. We send word, Matthew and I, for you to bring us a boy from the asylum. We told your brother Robert to tell you we wanted a boy ten or eleven years old.''

(<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Spencer/Mrs. Alexander Spencer/Spencer</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Spencer in distress. '' Why, Robert sent word down by his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) daughter Nancy

I did the best I could and I thought I was following your instructions. Nancy is a terrible flighty thing.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was our own fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla resignedly. <div class="bookquote">``We should have come to you ourselves and not left an important message to be passed along by word of mouth in that fashion. Anyhow, the mistake has been made and the only thing to do is to set it right. Can we send the child back to the asylum?

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Spencer/Mrs. Alexander Spencer/Spencer</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Spencer thoughtfully, <div class="bookquote">``but I don't think it will be necessary to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) back. Mrs. Peter Blewett was up here yesterday, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Blewett</b></font>) was saying to me how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Blewett</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Blewett</b></font>)'d sent by me for a little girl to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Blewett</b></font>). Mrs. Peter has a large family, you know, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) finds it hard to get help. Anne will be the very girl for you. I call it positively providential. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Spencer/Mrs. Alexander Spencer/Spencer</b></font>)</div>Marilla did not look as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) thought Providence had much to do with the matter. Here was an unexpectedly good chance to get this unwelcome orphan off her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) hands, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) did not even feel grateful for it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) knew Mrs. Peter Blewett only by sight as a small, shrewish-faced woman without an ounce of superfluous flesh on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bones. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). ''
<p/>A terrible worker and driver,'' Mrs. Peter was said to be; and discharged servant girls told fearsome tales of her (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) temper and stinginess, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) family of pert, quarrelsome children. Marilla felt a qualm of conscience at the thought of handing Anne over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) tender mercies. '' Well, I'll go in and we'll talk the matter over,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And if there isn't Mrs. Peter coming up the lane this blessed minute!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Spencer/Mrs. Alexander Spencer/Spencer</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Spencer, bustling her (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) guests through the hall into the parlor, where a deadly chill struck on them as if the air had been strained so long through dark green, closely drawn blinds that it had lost every particle of warmth it had ever possessed. <div class="bookquote">``That is real lucky, for we can settle the matter right away. Take the armchair, Miss Cuthbert. Anne, you sit here on the ottoman and don't wiggle. Let me take your hats. Flora Jane, go out and put the kettle on. Good afternoon, Mrs. Blewett. We were just saying how fortunate it was you happened along. Let me introduce you two ladies. Mrs. Blewett, Miss Cuthbert. Please excuse me for just a moment. I forgot to tell Flora Jane to take the buns out of the oven.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Spencer/Mrs. Alexander Spencer/Spencer</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Spencer whisked away, after pulling up the blinds. Anne sitting mutely on the ottoman, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands clasped tightly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lap, stared at Mrs Blewett as one fascinated. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to be given into the keeping of this sharp-faced, sharp-eyed woman? She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt a lump coming up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) throat and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes smarted painfully.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was beginning to be afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) couldn't keep the tears back when Mrs. Spencer returned, flushed and beaming, quite capable of taking any and every difficulty, physical, mental or spiritual, into consideration and settling it out of hand. <div class="bookquote">``It seems there's been a mistake about this little girl, Mrs. Blewett,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Blewett</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I was under the impression that Mr. and Miss Cuthbert wanted a little girl to adopt. I was certainly told so. But it seems it was a boy they wanted. So if you're still of the same mind you were yesterday, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>)'ll be just the thing for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Blewett/Mrs. Peter/Mrs. Peter Blewett</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Blewett darted her (<font color='blue'><b>Blewett</b></font>) eyes over Anne from head to foot. '' How old are you and what's your name? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Blewett</b></font>) demanded. '' Anne Shirley,'' faltered the shrinking child, not daring to make any stipulations regarding the spelling thereof, <div class="bookquote">``and I'm eleven years old.''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Humph! You don't look as if there was much to you. But you're wiry. I don't know but the wiry ones are the best after all.

Yes, I suppose I might as well take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) off your hands, Miss Cuthbert. The baby's awful fractious, and I'm clean worn out attending to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). If you like I can take her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) right home now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla looked at Anne and softened at sight of the child's pale face with its look of mute misery--the misery of a helpless little creature who finds itself once more caught in the trap from which it had escaped.
<p/>Marilla felt an uncomfortable conviction that, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) denied the appeal of that look, it would haunt her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) dying day. More-over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) did not fancy Mrs. Blewett. To hand a sensitive, <div class="bookquote">``highstrung''  (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div>child over to such a woman! No, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not take the responsibility of doing that! '' Well, I don't know,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said slowly. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't say that Matthew and I had absolutely decided that we wouldn't keep her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). In fact I may say that Matthew is disposed to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I just came over to find out how the mistake had occurred. I think I'd better take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) home again and talk it over with Matthew. I feel that I oughtn't to decide on anything without consulting him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>). If we make up our mind not to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) we'll bring or send her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) over to you tomorrow night. If we don't you may know that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is going to stay with us. Will that suit you, Mrs. Blewett?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it'll have to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Blewett/Mrs. Peter/Mrs. Peter Blewett</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Blewett ungraciously. During Marilla's speech a sunrise had been dawning on Anne's face. First the look of despair faded out; then came a faint flush of hope; her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes grew deep and bright as morning stars. The child was quite transfigured; and, a moment later, when Mrs. Spencer and Mrs. Blewett went out in quest of a recipe the latter had come to borrow she (<font color='blue'><b>Blewett</b></font>) sprang up and flew across the room to Marilla. '' Oh, Miss Cuthbert, did you really say that perhaps you would let me stay at Green Gables? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) said, in a breathless whisper, as if speaking aloud might shatter the glorious possibility. <div class="bookquote">``Did you really say it? Or did I only imagine that you did?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you'd better learn to control that imagination of yours, Anne, if you can't distinguish between what is real and what isn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla crossly. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, you did hear me say just that and no more. It isn't decided yet and perhaps we will conclude to let Mrs. Blewett take you after all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Blewett</b></font>) certainly needs you much more than I do.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'd rather go back to the asylum than go to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Blewett</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne passionately. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) looks exactly like a--like a gimlet. '' Marilla smothered a smile under the conviction that Anne must be reproved for such a speech. '' A little girl like you should be ashamed of talking so about a lady and a stranger,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said severely. <div class="bookquote">``Go back and sit down quietly and hold your tongue and behave as a good girl should.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll try to do and be anything you want me, if you'll only keep me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne, returning meekly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ottoman. When they arrived back at Green Gables that evening Matthew met them in the lane. Marilla from afar had noted him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) prowling along it and guessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) motive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) was prepared for the relief she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) read in his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) face when he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had at least brought back Anne back with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said nothing, to him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>), relative to the affair, until they were both out in the yard behind the barn milking the cows. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) briefly told him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) Anne's history and the result of the interview with Mrs. Spencer. <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't give a dog I liked to that Blewett woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew with unusual vim. <div class="bookquote">``I don't fancy her (<font color='blue'><b>Blewett</b></font>) style myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>admitted Marilla, <div class="bookquote">``but it's that or keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) ourselves, Matthew.
<p/>And since you seem to want her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>), I suppose I'm willing--or have to be. I've been thinking over the idea until I've got kind of used to it. It seems a sort of duty. I've never brought up a child, especially a girl, and I dare say I'll make a terrible mess of it. But I'll do my best. So far as I'm concerned, Matthew, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) may stay. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Matthew's shy face was a glow of delight. <div class="bookquote">``Well now, I reckoned you'd come to see it in that light, Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s such an interesting little thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It'd be more to the point if you could say she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) was a useful little thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>retorted Marilla, <div class="bookquote">``but I'll make it my business to see she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s trained to be that. And mind, Matthew, you're not to go interfering with my methods. Perhaps an old maid doesn't know much about bringing up a child, but I guess she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) knows more than an old bachelor. So you just leave me to manage her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>). When I fail it'll be time enough to put your oar in.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There, there, Marilla, you can have your own way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew reassuringly. <div class="bookquote">``Only be as good and kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) as you can without spoiling her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>). I kind of think she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s one of the sort you can do anything with if you only get her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) to love you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla sniffed, to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) contempt for Matthew's opinions concerning anything feminine, and walked off to the dairy with the pails. <div class="bookquote">``I won't tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) tonight that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) can stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) reflected, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) strained the milk into the creamers. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'d be so excited that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) wouldn't sleep a wink. Marilla Cuthbert, you're fairly in for it.
<p/>Did you ever suppose you'd see the day when you'd be adopting an orphan girl? It's surprising enough; but not so surprising as that Matthew should be at the bottom of it, him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) that always seemed to have such a mortal dread of little girls. Anyhow, we've decided on the experiment and goodness only knows what will come of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER VII. Anne Says Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) Prayers |WHEN Marilla took Anne up to bed that night she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) said stiffly: <div class="bookquote">``Now, Anne, I noticed last night that you threw your clothes all about the floor when you took them off. That is a very untidy habit, and I can't allow it at all. As soon as you take off any article of clothing fold it neatly and place it on the chair. I haven't any use at all for little girls who aren't neat.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was so harrowed up in my mind last night that I didn't think about my clothes at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I'll fold them nicely tonight. They always made us do that at the asylum. Half the time, though, I'd forget, I'd be in such a hurry to get into bed nice and quiet and imagine things.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You'll have to remember a little better if you stay here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>admonished Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``There, that looks something like. Say your prayers now and get into bed.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I never say any prayers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>announced Anne. Marilla looked horrified astonishment. '' Why, Anne, what do you mean? Were you never taught to say your prayers? God always wants little girls to say their prayers. Don't you know who God is, Anne?'' ''`God is a spirit, infinite, eternal and unchangeable, in His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth,''' responded Anne promptly and glibly. Marilla looked rather relieved.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you do know something then, thank goodness! You're not quite a heathen. Where did you learn that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, at the asylum Sunday-school. They made us learn the whole catechism. I liked it pretty well. There's something splendid about some of the words. ' Infinite, eternal and unchangeable.' Isn't that grand? It has such a roll to it--just like a big organ playing. You couldn't quite call it poetry, I suppose, but it sounds a lot like it, doesn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We're not talking about poetry, Anne--we are talking about saying your prayers. Don't you know it's a terrible wicked thing not to say your prayers every night? I'm afraid you are a very bad little girl.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You'd find it easier to be bad than good if you had red hair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne reproachfully. <div class="bookquote">``People who haven't red hair don't know what trouble is. Mrs. Thomas told me that God made my hair red on purpose , and I've never cared about Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) since. And anyhow I'd always be too tired at night to bother saying prayers. People who have to look after twins can't be expected to say their prayers. Now, do you honestly think they can? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla decided that Anne's religious training must be begun at once. Plainly there was no time to be lost. <div class="bookquote">``You must say your prayers while you are under my roof, Anne.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, of course, if you want me to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>assented Anne cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``I'd do anything to oblige you. But you'll have to tell me what to say for this once. After I get into bed I'll imagine out a real nice prayer to say always. I believe that it will be quite interesting, now that I come to think of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You must kneel down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla in embarrassment.
<p/>Anne knelt at Marilla's knee and looked up gravely. <div class="bookquote">``Why must people kneel down to pray? If I really wanted to pray I'll tell you what I'd do. I'd go out into a great big field all alone or into the deep, deep, woods, and I'd look up into the sky--up--up-- up--into that lovely blue sky that looks as if there was no end to its blueness. And then I'd just feel a prayer. Well, I'm ready. What am I to say? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla felt more embarrassed than ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had intended to teach Anne the childish classic, <div class="bookquote">``Now I lay me down to sleep. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had, as I have told you, the glimmerings of a sense of humor--which is simply another name for a sense of fitness of things; and it suddenly occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) that that simple little prayer, sacred to white-robed childhood lisping at motherly knees, was entirely unsuited to this freckled witch of a girl who knew and cared nothing about God's love, since she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had never had it translated to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) through the medium of human love. <div class="bookquote">``You're old enough to pray for yourself, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said finally. '' Just thank God for your blessings and ask Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) humbly for the things you want.'' <div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll do my best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>promised Anne, burying her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face in Marilla's lap. '' Gracious heavenly Father--that's the way the ministers say it in church, so I suppose it's all right in private prayer, isn't it?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) interjected, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head for a moment. '' Gracious heavenly Father, I thank Thee for the White Way of Delight and the Lake of Shining Waters and Bonny and the Snow Queen. I'm really extremely grateful for them.
<p/>And that's all the blessings I can think of just now to thank Thee for. As for the things I want, they're so numerous that it would take a great deal of time to name them all so I will only mention the two most important. Please let me stay at Green Gables; and please let me be good-looking when I grow up. I remain, ``Yours respectfully, Anne Shirley. <div class="bookquote">``There, did I do all right? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) asked eagerly, getting up. <div class="bookquote">``I could have made it much more flowery if I'd had a little more time to think it over.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Poor Marilla was only preserved from complete collapse by remembering that it was not irreverence, but simply spiritual ignorance on the part of Anne that was responsible for this extraordinary petition. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tucked the child up in bed, mentally vowing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should be taught a prayer the very next day, and was leaving the room with the light when Anne called her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) back. <div class="bookquote">``I've just thought of it now. I should have said, `Amen' in place of `yours respectfully,' shouldn't I?--the way the ministers do. I'd forgotten it, but I felt a prayer should be finished off in some way, so I put in the other. Do you suppose it will make any difference?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I--I don't suppose it will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``Go to sleep now like a good child. Good night.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can only say good night tonight with a clear conscience,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne, cuddling luxuriously down among her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) pillows. Marilla retreated to the kitchen, set the candle firmly on the table, and glared at Matthew. '' Matthew Cuthbert, it's about time somebody adopted that child and taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) something. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s next door to a perfect heathen.
<p/>Will you believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) never said a prayer in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) life till tonight? I'll send her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) to the manse tomorrow and borrow the Peep of the Day series, that's what I'll do. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) shall go to Sunday-school just as soon as I can get some suitable clothes made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>). I foresee that I shall have my hands full. Well, well, we can't get through this world without our share of trouble. I've had a pretty easy life of it so far, but my time has come at last and I suppose I'll just have to make the best of it.'' CHAPTER VIII. Anne's Bringing-up Is Begun |FOR reasons best known to herself, Marilla did not tell Anne that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) was to stay at Green Gables until the next afternoon. During the forenoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) kept the child busy with various tasks and watched over her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) with a keen eye while she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) did them. By noon she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had concluded that Anne was smart and obedient, willing to work and quick to learn; her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) most serious shortcoming seemed to be a tendency to fall into daydreams in the middle of a task and forget all about it until such time as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was sharply recalled to earth by a reprimand or a catastrophe. When Anne had finished washing the dinner dishes she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) suddenly confronted Marilla with the air and expression of one desperately determined to learn the worst. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thin little body trembled from head to foot; her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face flushed and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes dilated until they were almost black; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands tightly and said in an imploring voice: '' Oh, please, Miss Cuthbert, won't you tell me if you are going to send me away or not?
<p/>I've tried to be patient all the morning, but I really feel that I cannot bear not knowing any longer. It's a dreadful feeling. Please tell me.'' <div class="bookquote">``You haven't scalded the dishcloth in clean hot water as I told you to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla immovably. '' Just go and do it before you ask any more questions, Anne. '' Anne went and attended to the dishcloth. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) returned to Marilla and fastened imploring eyes of the latter's face. '' Well,'' said Marilla, unable to find any excuse for deferring her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) explanation longer, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose I might as well tell you. Matthew and I have decided to keep you--that is, if you will try to be a good little girl and show yourself grateful. Why, child, whatever is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm crying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne in a tone of bewilderment. <div class="bookquote">``I can't think why. I'm glad as glad can be. Oh, glad doesn't seem the right word at all. I was glad about the White Way and the cherry blossoms--but this! Oh, it's something more than glad. I'm so happy. I'll try to be so good. It will be uphill work, I expect, for Mrs. Thomas often told me I was desperately wicked. However, I'll do my very best. But can you tell me why I'm crying?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it's because you're all excited and worked up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla disapprovingly. <div class="bookquote">``Sit down on that chair and try to calm yourself. I'm afraid you both cry and laugh far too easily. Yes, you can stay here and we will try to do right by you. You must go to school; but it's only a fortnight till vacation so it isn't worth while for you to start before it opens again in September.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What am I to call you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>asked Anne.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I always say Miss Cuthbert? Can I call you Aunt Marilla?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No; you'll call me just plain Marilla. I'm not used to being called Miss Cuthbert and it would make me nervous.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It sounds awfully disrespectful to just say Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>protested Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I guess there'll be nothing disrespectful in it if you're careful to speak respectfully. Everybody, young and old, in Avonlea calls me Marilla except the minister.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'd love to call you Aunt Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne wistfully. <div class="bookquote">``I've never had an aunt or any relation at all--not even a grandmother. It would make me feel as if I really belonged to you. Can't I call you Aunt Marilla?''

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla grimly. <div class="bookquote">``Do you never imagine things different from what they really are?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>asked Anne wide-eyed. '' No.'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne drew a long breath. '' Oh, Miss--Marilla, how much you miss!'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe in imagining things different from what they really are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>retorted Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``When the Lord puts us in certain circumstances He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) doesn't mean for us to imagine them away. And that reminds me. Go into the sitting room, Anne--be sure your feet are clean and don't let any flies in--and bring me out the illustrated card that's on the mantelpiece. The Lord's Prayer is on it and you'll devote your spare time this afternoon to learning it off by heart. There's to be no more of such praying as I heard last night.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I was very awkward,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne apologetically, <div class="bookquote">``but then, you see, I'd never had any practice.
<p/>You couldn't really expect a person to pray very well the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tried, could you? I thought out a splendid prayer after I went to bed, just as I promised you I would. It was nearly as long as a minister's and so poetical. But would you believe it? I couldn't remember one word when I woke up this morning. And I'm afraid I'll never be able to think out another one as good. Somehow, things never are so good when they're thought out a second time. Have you ever noticed that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Here is something for you to notice, Anne. When I tell you to do a thing I want you to obey me at once and not stand stock-still and discourse about it. Just you go and do as I bid you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne promptly departed for the sitting-room across the hall; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) failed to return; after waiting ten minutes Marilla laid down her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) knitting and marched after her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) with a grim expression. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) found Anne standing motionless before a picture hanging on the wall between the two windows, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes a-star with dreams. The white and green light strained through apple trees and clustering vines outside fell over the rapt little figure with a half-unearthly radiance. '' Anne, whatever are you thinking of? '' demanded Marilla sharply. Anne came back to earth with a start. <div class="bookquote">``That,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, pointing to the picture--a rather vivid chromo entitled, <div class="bookquote">``Christ Blessing Little Children'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``and I was just imagining I was one of them--that I was the little girl in the blue dress, standing off by herself in the corner as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) didn't belong to anybody, like me. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looks lonely and sad, don't you think? I guess she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hadn't any father or mother of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wanted to be blessed, too, so she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) just crept shyly up on the outside of the crowd, hoping nobody would notice her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)--except Him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I'm sure I know just how she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart must have beat and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands must have got cold, like mine did when I asked you if I could stay. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was afraid He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mightn't notice her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). But it's likely He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did, don't you think? I've been trying to imagine it all out--her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) edging a little nearer all the time until she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was quite close to Him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); and then He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would look at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and put His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair and oh, such a thrill of joy as would run over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)! But I wish the artist hadn't painted Him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) so sorrowful looking. All His (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) pictures are like that, if you've noticed. But I don't believe He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) could really have looked so sad or the children would have been afraid of Him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, wondering why she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had not broken into this speech long before, <div class="bookquote">``you shouldn't talk that way. It's irreverent--positively irreverent. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Anne's eyes marveled. <div class="bookquote">``Why, I felt just as reverent as could be. I'm sure I didn't mean to be irreverent.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well I don't suppose you did--but it doesn't sound right to talk so familiarly about such things. And another thing, Anne, when I send you after something you're to bring it at once and not fall into mooning and imagining before pictures. Remember that. Take that card and come right to the kitchen. Now, sit down in the corner and learn that prayer off by heart. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne set the card up against the jugful of apple blossoms she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had brought in to decorate the dinner-table--Marilla had eyed that decoration askance, but had said nothing--propped her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) chin on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) hands, and fell to studying it intently for several silent minutes. <div class="bookquote">``I like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) announced at length. <div class="bookquote">``It's beautiful. I've heard it before --I heard the superintendent of the asylum Sunday school say it over once. But I didn't like it then. He (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) had such a cracked voice and he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) prayed it so mournfully. I really felt sure he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) thought praying was a disagreeable duty. This isn't poetry, but it makes me feel just the same way poetry does. ' Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be Thy name.' That is just like a line of music. Oh, I'm so glad you thought of making me learn this, Miss--Marilla.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, learn it and hold your tongue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla shortly. Anne tipped the vase of apple blossoms near enough to bestow a soft kiss on a pink-cupped bud, and then studied diligently for some moments longer. '' Marilla,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) demanded presently, <div class="bookquote">``do you think that I shall ever have a bosom friend in Avonlea?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A--a what kind of friend?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A bosom friend--an intimate friend, you know--a really kindred spirit to whom I can confide my inmost soul. I've dreamed of meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) all my life.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Diana Barry lives over at Orchard Slope and she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>)'s about your age. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>)'s a very nice little girl, and perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) will be a playmate for you when she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) comes home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>)'s visiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) aunt over at Carmody just now.
<p/>You'll have to be careful how you behave yourself, though. Mrs. Barry is a very particular woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) won't let Diana play with any little girl who isn't nice and good.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne looked at Marilla through the apple blossoms, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes aglow with interest. <div class="bookquote">``What is Diana like? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) hair isn't red, is it? Oh, I hope not. It's bad enough to have red hair myself, but I positively couldn't endure it in a bosom friend.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Diana is a very pretty little girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) has black eyes and hair and rosy cheeks. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) is good and smart, which is better than being pretty. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla was as fond of morals as the Duchess in Wonderland, and was firmly convinced that one should be tacked on to every remark made to a child who was being brought up. But Anne waved the moral inconsequently aside and seized only on the delightful possibilities before it. '' Oh, I'm so glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'s pretty. Next to being beautiful oneself--and that's impossible in my case--it would be best to have a beautiful bosom friend. When I lived with Mrs. Thomas she (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had a bookcase in her (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sitting room with glass doors. There weren't any books in it; Mrs. Thomas kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) best china and her (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) preserves there--when she (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had any preserves to keep. One of the doors was broken. Mr. Thomas smashed it one night when he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was slightly intoxicated. But the other was whole and I used to pretend that my reflection in it was another little girl who lived in it. I called her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) Katie Maurice, and we were very intimate. I used to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) by the hour, especially on Sunday, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) everything. Katie was the comfort and consolation of my life.
<p/>We used to pretend that the bookcase was enchanted and that if I only knew the spell I could open the door and step right into the room where Katie Maurice lived, instead of into Mrs. Thomas' shelves of preserves and china. And then Katie Maurice would have taken me by the hand and led me out into a wonderful place, all flowers and sunshine and fairies, and we would have lived there happy for ever after. When I went to live with Mrs. Hammond it just broke my heart to leave Katie Maurice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) felt it dreadfully, too, I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) did, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) was crying when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) kissed me good-bye through the bookcase door. There was no bookcase at Mrs. Hammond's. But just up the river a little way from the house there was a long green little valley, and the loveliest echo lived there. It echoed back every word you said, even if you didn't talk a bit loud. So I imagined that it was a little girl called Violetta and we were great friends and I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Violetta</b></font>) almost as well as I loved Katie Maurice--not quite, but almost, you know. The night before I went to the asylum I said good-bye to Violetta, and oh, her (<font color='blue'><b>Violetta</b></font>) good-bye came back to me in such sad, sad tones. I had become so attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Violetta</b></font>) that I hadn't the heart to imagine a bosom friend at the asylum, even if there had been any scope for imagination there.'' <div class="bookquote">``I think it's just as well there wasn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla drily. <div class="bookquote">``I don't approve of such goings-on. You seem to half believe your own imaginations. It will be well for you to have a real live friend to put such nonsense out of your head.
<p/>But don't let Mrs. Barry hear you talking about your Katie Maurices and your Violettas or she (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>)'ll think you tell stories.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I won't. I couldn't talk of them to everybody--their memories are too sacred for that. But I thought I'd like to have you know about them. Oh, look, here's a big bee just tumbled out of an apple blossom. Just think what a lovely place to live--in an apple blossom! Fancy going to sleep in it when the wind was rocking it. If I wasn't a human girl I think I'd like to be a bee and live among the flowers.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yesterday you wanted to be a sea gull,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>sniffed Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``I think you are very fickle minded.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I know it pretty nearly all now--all but just the last line.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, never mind, do as I tell you.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can I take the apple blossoms with me for company? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>pleaded Anne. '' No; you don't want your room cluttered up with flowers. You should have left them on the tree in the first place.'' <div class="bookquote">``I did feel a little that way, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I kind of felt I shouldn't shorten their lovely lives by picking them--I wouldn't want to be picked if I were an apple blossom. But the temptation was irresistible . What do you do when you meet with an irresistible temptation?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Anne, did you hear me tell you to go to your room?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne sighed, retreated to the east gable, and sat down in a chair by the window. <div class="bookquote">``There--I know this prayer. I learned that last sentence coming upstairs. Now I'm going to imagine things into this room so that they'll always stay imagined. The floor is covered with a white velvet carpet with pink roses all over it and there are pink silk curtains at the windows. The walls are hung with gold and silver brocade tapestry. The furniture is mahogany. I never saw any mahogany, but it does sound so luxurious. This is a couch all heaped with gorgeous silken cushions, pink and blue and crimson and gold, and I am reclining gracefully on it. I can see my reflection in that splendid big mirror hanging on the wall. I am tall and regal, clad in a gown of trailing white lace, with a pearl cross on my breast and pearls in my hair. My hair is of midnight darkness and my skin is a clear ivory pallor. My name is the Lady Cordelia Fitzgerald. No, it isn't --I can't make that seem real. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) danced up to the little looking-glass and peered into it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>) pointed freckled face and solemn gray eyes peered back at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzgerald</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You're only Anne of Green Gables,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said earnestly, <div class="bookquote">``and I see you, just as you are looking now, whenever I try to imagine I'm the Lady Cordelia. But it's a million times nicer to be Anne of Green Gables than Anne of nowhere in particular, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) bent forward, kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) reflection affectionately, and betook herself to the open window. '' Dear Snow Queen, good afternoon. And good afternoon dear birches down in the hollow. And good afternoon, dear gray house up on the hill.
<p/>I wonder if Diana is to be my bosom friend. I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) will, and I shall love her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) very much. But I must never quite forget Katie Maurice and Violetta. They would feel so hurt if I did and I'd hate to hurt anybody's feelings, even a little bookcase girl's or a little echo girl's. I must be careful to remember them and send them a kiss every day. '' Anne blew a couple of airy kisses from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) fingertips past the cherry blossoms and then, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) chin in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands, drifted luxuriously out on a sea of daydreams. CHAPTER IX. Mrs. Rachel Lynde Is Properly Horrified |ANNE had been a fortnight at Green Gables before Mrs. Lynde arrived to inspect her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>). Mrs. Rachel, to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) justice, was not to blame for this. A severe and unseasonable attack of grippe had confined that good lady to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) house ever since the occasion of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) last visit to Green Gables. Mrs. Rachel was not often sick and had a well-defined contempt for people who were; but grippe, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) asserted, was like no other illness on earth and could only be interpreted as one of the special visitations of Providence. As soon as her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) doctor allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) foot out-of-doors she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) hurried up to Green Gables, bursting with curiosity to see Matthew and Marilla's orphan, concerning whom all sorts of stories and suppositions had gone abroad in Avonlea. Anne had made good use of every waking moment of that fortnight. Already she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was acquainted with every tree and shrub about the place.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had discovered that a lane opened out below the apple orchard and ran up through a belt of woodland; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had explored it to its furthest end in all its delicious vagaries of brook and bridge, fir coppice and wild cherry arch, corners thick with fern, and branching byways of maple and mountain ash. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had made friends with the spring down in the hollow--that wonderful deep, clear icy-cold spring; it was set about with smooth red sandstones and rimmed in by great palm-like clumps of water fern; and beyond it was a log bridge over the brook. That bridge led Anne's dancing feet up over a wooded hill beyond, where perpetual twilight reigned under the straight, thick-growing firs and spruces; the only flowers there were myriads of delicate <div class="bookquote">``June bells,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>those shyest and sweetest of woodland blooms, and a few pale, aerial starflowers, like the spirits of last year's blossoms. Gossamers glimmered like threads of silver among the trees and the fir boughs and tassels seemed to utter friendly speech. All these raptured voyages of exploration were made in the odd half hours which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was allowed for play, and Anne talked Matthew and Marilla half-deaf over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) discoveries. Not that Matthew complained, to be sure; he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) listened to it all with a wordless smile of enjoyment on his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) face; Marilla permitted the <div class="bookquote">``chatter''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>until she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) found herself becoming too interested in it, whereupon she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) always promptly quenched Anne by a curt command to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tongue.
<p/>Anne was out in the orchard when Mrs. Rachel came, wandering at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) own sweet will through the lush, tremulous grasses splashed with ruddy evening sunshine; so that good lady had an excellent chance to talk her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) illness fully over, describing every ache and pulse beat with such evident enjoyment that Marilla thought even grippe must bring its compensations. When details were exhausted Mrs. Rachel introduced the real reason of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) call. <div class="bookquote">``I've been hearing some surprising things about you and Matthew.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose you are any more surprised than I am myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``I'm getting over my surprise now.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was too bad there was such a mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lynde/Mrs. Rachel/Rachel</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Rachel sympathetically. <div class="bookquote">``Couldn't you have sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) back?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I suppose we could, but we decided not to. Matthew took a fancy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>).

You don't know much about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) real disposition, I suppose, and there's no guessing how a child like that will turn out. But I don't want to discourage you I'm sure, Marilla. ''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm not feeling discouraged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>was Marilla's dry response, <div class="bookquote">``when I make up my mind to do a thing it stays made up. I suppose you'd like to see Anne. I'll call her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne came running in presently, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face sparkling with the delight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) orchard rovings; but, abashed at finding the delight herself in the unexpected presence of a stranger, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) halted confusedly inside the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) certainly was an odd-looking little creature in the short tight wincey dress she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had worn from the asylum, below which her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thin legs seemed ungracefully long. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) freckles were more numerous and obtrusive than ever; the wind had ruffled her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hatless hair into over-brilliant disorder; it had never looked redder than at that moment. '' Well, they didn't pick you for your looks, that's sure and certain,'' was Mrs. Rachel Lynde's emphatic comment. Mrs. Rachel was one of those delightful and popular people who pride themselves on speaking their mind without fear or favor. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>)'s terrible skinny and homely, Marilla. Come here, child, and let me have a look at you. Lawful heart, did any one ever see such freckles? And hair as red as carrots! Come here, child, I say. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne <div class="bookquote">``came there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>but not exactly as Mrs. Rachel expected. With one bound she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) crossed the kitchen floor and stood before Mrs. Rachel, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) face scarlet with anger, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) lips quivering, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) whole slender form trembling from head to foot. <div class="bookquote">``I hate you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) cried in a choked voice, stamping her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) foot on the floor. <div class="bookquote">``I hate you--I hate you--I hate you--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a louder stamp with each assertion of hatred. '' How dare you call me skinny and ugly? How dare you say I'm freckled and redheaded? You are a rude, impolite, unfeeling woman!'' <div class="bookquote">``Anne!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Marilla in consternation. But Anne continued to face Mrs. Rachel undauntedly, head up, eyes blazing, hands clenched, passionate indignation exhaling from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) like an atmosphere. <div class="bookquote">``How dare you say such things about me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) repeated vehemently. <div class="bookquote">``How would you like to have such things said about you? How would you like to be told that you are fat and clumsy and probably hadn't a spark of imagination in you? I don't care if I do hurt your feelings by saying so! I hope I hurt them. You have hurt mine worse than they were ever hurt before even by Mrs. Thomas' intoxicated husband. And I'll never forgive you for it, never, never!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Stamp! Stamp! '' Did anybody ever see such a temper! '' exclaimed the horrified Mrs. Rachel. <div class="bookquote">``Anne go to your room and stay there until I come up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, recovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) powers of speech with difficulty. Anne, bursting into tears, rushed to the hall door, slammed it until the tins on the porch wall outside rattled in sympathy, and fled through the hall and up the stairs like a whirlwind. A subdued slam above told that the door of the east gable had been shut with equal vehemence. '' Well, I don't envy you your job bringing that up, Marilla,'' said Mrs. Rachel with unspeakable solemnity. Marilla opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) lips to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) knew not what of apology or deprecation. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) did say was a surprise to herself then and ever afterwards. <div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't have twitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) looks, Rachel.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Marilla Cuthbert, you don't mean to say that you are upholding her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) in such a terrible display of temper as we've just seen? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lynde/Mrs. Rachel/Rachel</b></font>)</div>demanded Mrs. Rachel indignantly. '' No,'' said Marilla slowly, <div class="bookquote">``I'm not trying to excuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s been very naughty and I'll have to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) a talking to about it. But we must make allowances for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s never been taught what is right. And you were too hard on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>), Rachel.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla could not help tacking on that last sentence, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) was again surprised at herself for doing it. Mrs. Rachel got up with an air of offended dignity. '' Well, I see that I'll have to be very careful what I say after this, Marilla, since the fine feelings of orphans, brought from goodness knows where, have to be considered before anything else. Oh, no, I'm not vexed--don't worry yourself. I'm too sorry for you to leave any room for anger in my mind. You'll have your own troubles with that child. But if you'll take my advice--which I suppose you won't do, although I've brought up ten children and buried two--you'll do that `talking to' you mention with a fair-sized birch switch. I should think that would be the most effective language for that kind of a child. Her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) temper matches her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) hair I guess. Well, good evening, Marilla. I hope you'll come down to see me often as usual. But you can't expect me to visit here again in a hurry, if I'm liable to be flown at and insulted in such a fashion. It's something new in my experience.'' Whereat Mrs. Rachel swept out and away--if a fat woman who always waddled could be said to sweep away--and Marilla with a very solemn face betook herself to the east gable. On the way upstairs she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) pondered uneasily as to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) ought to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) felt no little dismay over the scene that had just been enacted. How unfortunate that Anne should have displayed such temper before Mrs. Rachel Lynde, of all people! Then Marilla suddenly became aware of an uncomfortable and rebuking consciousness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) felt more humiliation over this than sorrow over the discovery of such a serious defect in Anne's disposition.
<p/>And how was she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to punish her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)? The amiable suggestion of the birch switch--to the efficiency of which all of Mrs. Rachel's own children could have borne smarting testimony--did not appeal to Marilla. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) did not believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) could whip a child. No, some other method of punishment must be found to bring Anne to a proper realization of the enormity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) offense. Marilla found Anne face downward on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) bed, crying bitterly, quite oblivious of muddy boots on a clean counterpane. '' Anne,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said not ungently. No answer. '' Anne,'' with greater severity, <div class="bookquote">``get off that bed this minute and listen to what I have to say to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne squirmed off the bed and sat rigidly on a chair beside it, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face swollen and tear-stained and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes fixed stubbornly on the floor. <div class="bookquote">``This is a nice way for you to behave. Anne! Aren't you ashamed of yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hadn't any right to call me ugly and redheaded,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>retorted Anne, evasive and defiant. <div class="bookquote">``You hadn't any right to fly into such a fury and talk the way you did to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), Anne. I was ashamed of you--thoroughly ashamed of you. I wanted you to behave nicely to Mrs. Lynde, and instead of that you have disgraced me. I'm sure I don't know why you should lose your temper like that just because Mrs. Lynde said you were red-haired and homely. You say it yourself often enough.''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, but there's such a difference between saying a thing yourself and hearing other people say it,'' wailed Anne. <div class="bookquote">``You may know a thing is so, but you can't help hoping other people don't quite think it is. I suppose you think I have an awful temper, but I couldn't help it.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said those things something just rose right up in me and choked me. I had to fly out at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, you made a fine exhibition of yourself I must say. Mrs. Lynde will have a nice story to tell about you everywhere--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>)'ll tell it, too.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just imagine how you would feel if somebody told you to your face that you were skinny and ugly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>pleaded Anne tearfully. An old remembrance suddenly rose up before Marilla. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been a very small child when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had heard one aunt say of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to another, <div class="bookquote">``What a pity she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is such a dark, homely little thing. ''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>Marilla was every day of fifty before the sting had gone out of that memory. <div class="bookquote">``I don't say that I think Mrs. Lynde was exactly right in saying what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) did to you, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) admitted in a softer tone. <div class="bookquote">``Rachel is too outspoken. But that is no excuse for such behavior on your part. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was a stranger and an elderly person and my visitor--all three very good reasons why you should have been respectful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). You were rude and saucy and'' (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>--Marilla had a saving inspiration of punishment--<div class="bookquote">``you must go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) you are very sorry for your bad temper and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) to forgive you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can never do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne determinedly and darkly. <div class="bookquote">``You can punish me in any way you like, Marilla.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We're not in the habit of shutting people up in dark damp dungeons,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla drily, <div class="bookquote">``especially as they're rather scarce in Avonlea. But apologize to Mrs. Lynde you must and shall and you'll stay here in your room until you can tell me you're willing to do it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I shall have to stay here forever then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne mournfully, <div class="bookquote">``because I can't tell Mrs. Lynde I'm sorry I said those things to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>). How can I? I'm not sorry. I'm sorry I've vexed you; but I'm glad I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) just what I did. It was a great satisfaction. I can't say I'm sorry when I'm not, can I? I can't even imagine I'm sorry.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps your imagination will be in better working order by the morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, rising to depart. <div class="bookquote">``You'll have the night to think over your conduct in and come to a better frame of mind. You said you would try to be a very good girl if we kept you at Green Gables, but I must say it hasn't seemed very much like it this evening.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Leaving this Parthian shaft to rankle in Anne's stormy bosom, Marilla descended to the kitchen, grievously troubled in mind and vexed in soul. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) was as angry with herself as with Anne, because, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) recalled Mrs. Rachel's dumbfounded countenance her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lips twitched with amusement and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt a most reprehensible desire to laugh. CHAPTER X. Anne's Apology |MARILLA said nothing to Matthew about the affair that evening; but when Anne proved still refractory the next morning an explanation had to be made to account for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) absence from the breakfast table. Marilla told Matthew the whole story, taking pains to impress him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) with a due sense of the enormity of Anne's behavior.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a good thing Rachel Lynde got a calling down; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>)'s a meddlesome old gossip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>was Matthew's consolatory rejoinder. '' Matthew Cuthbert, I'm astonished at you. You know that Anne's behavior was dreadful, and yet you take her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) part! I suppose you'll be saying next thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) oughtn't to be punished at all!'' <div class="bookquote">``Well now--no--not exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew uneasily. <div class="bookquote">``I reckon she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ought to be punished a little. But don't be too hard on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), Marilla. Recollect she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) hasn't ever had anyone to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) right. You're--you're going to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) something to eat, aren't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``When did you ever hear of me starving people into good behavior?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>demanded Marilla indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'ll have her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) meals regular, and I'll carry them up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) myself. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'ll stay up there until she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s willing to apologize to Mrs. Lynde, and that's final, Matthew.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Breakfast, dinner, and supper were very silent meals--for Anne still remained obdurate. After each meal Marilla carried a well-filled tray to the east gable and brought it down later on not noticeably depleted. Matthew eyed its last descent with a troubled eye. Had Anne eaten anything at all? When Marilla went out that evening to bring the cows from the back pasture, Matthew, who had been hanging about the barns and watching, slipped into the house with the air of a burglar and crept upstairs. As a general thing Matthew gravitated between the kitchen and the little bedroom off the hall where he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) slept; once in a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) ventured uncomfortably into the parlor or sitting room when the minister came to tea. But he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) had never been upstairs in his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) own house since the spring he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) helped Marilla paper the spare bedroom, and that was four years ago.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) tiptoed along the hall and stood for several minutes outside the door of the east gable before he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) summoned courage to tap on it with his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) fingers and then open the door to peep in. Anne was sitting on the yellow chair by the window gazing mournfully out into the garden. Very small and unhappy she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) looked, and Matthew's heart smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) softly closed the door and tiptoed over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). '' Anne,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) whispered, as if afraid of being overheard, <div class="bookquote">``how are you making it, Anne?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Anne smiled wanly. '' Pretty well. I imagine a good deal, and that helps to pass the time. Of course, it's rather lonesome. But then, I may as well get used to that. '' Anne smiled again, bravely facing the long years of solitary imprisonment before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Matthew recollected that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) must say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had come to say without loss of time, lest Marilla return prematurely. '' Well now, Anne, don't you think you'd better do it and have it over with?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``It'll have to be done sooner or later, you know, for Marilla's a dreadful deter-mined woman--dreadful determined, Anne. Do it right off, I say, and have it over.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean apologize to Mrs. Lynde?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes--apologize--that's the very word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``Just smooth it over so to speak. That's what I was trying to get at.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I could do it to oblige you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``It would be true enough to say I am sorry, because I am sorry now. I wasn't a bit sorry last night. I was mad clear through, and I stayed mad all night. I know I did because I woke up three times and I was just furious every time. But this morning it was over.
<p/>I wasn't in a temper anymore--and it left a dreadful sort of goneness, too. I felt so ashamed of myself. But I just couldn't think of going and telling Mrs. Lynde so. It would be so humiliating. I made up my mind I'd stay shut up here forever rather than do that. But still--I'd do anything for you--if you really want me to--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well now, of course I do. It's terrible lonesome downstairs without you. Just go and smooth things over--that's a good girl.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne resignedly. <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell Marilla as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) comes in I've repented.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's right-- that's right, Anne. But don't tell Marilla I said anything about it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might think I was putting my oar in and I promised not to do that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wild horses won't drag the secret from me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>promised Anne solemnly. <div class="bookquote">``How would wild horses drag a secret from a person anyhow?''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>But Matthew was gone, scared at his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) own success. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) fled hastily to the remotest corner of the horse pasture lest Marilla should suspect what he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had been up to. Marilla herself, upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) return to the house, was agreeably surprised to hear a plaintive voice calling, <div class="bookquote">``Marilla''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>over the banisters. '' Well?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) said, going into the hall. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry I lost my temper and said rude things, and I'm willing to go and tell Mrs. Lynde so.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla's crispness gave no sign of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) relief. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had been wondering what under the canopy she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) should do if Anne did not give in. <div class="bookquote">``I'll take you down after milking.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Accordingly, after milking, behold Marilla and Anne walking down the lane, the former erect and triumphant, the latter drooping and dejected. But halfway down Anne's dejection vanished as if by enchantment.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head and stepped lightly along, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes fixed on the sunset sky and an air of subdued exhilaration about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Marilla beheld the change disapprovingly. This was no meek penitent such as it behooved her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) to take into the presence of the offended Mrs. Lynde. <div class="bookquote">``What are you thinking of, Anne?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) asked sharply. <div class="bookquote">``I'm imagining out what I must say to Mrs. Lynde,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>answered Anne dreamily. This was satisfactory--or should have been so. But Marilla could not rid herself of the notion that something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) scheme of punishment was going askew. Anne had no business to look so rapt and radiant. Rapt and radiant Anne continued until they were in the very presence of Mrs. Lynde, who was sitting knitting by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) kitchen window. Then the radiance vanished. Mournful penitence appeared on every feature. Before a word was spoken Anne suddenly went down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knees before the astonished Mrs. Rachel and held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands beseechingly. '' Oh, Mrs. Lynde, I am so extremely sorry,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) said with a quiver in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``I could never express all my sorrow, no, not if I used up a whole dictionary. You must just imagine it. I behaved terribly to you--and I've disgraced the dear friends, Matthew and Marilla, who have let me stay at Green Gables although I'm not a boy. I'm a dreadfully wicked and ungrateful girl, and I deserve to be punished and cast out by respectable people forever. It was very wicked of me to fly into a temper because you told me the truth. It was the truth; every word you said was true. My hair is red and I'm freckled and skinny and ugly. What I said to you was true, too, but I shouldn't have said it.
<p/>Oh, Mrs. Lynde, please, please, forgive me. If you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow on a poor little orphan girl, would you, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had a dreadful temper? Oh, I am sure you wouldn't. Please say you forgive me, Mrs. Lynde. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands together, bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head, and waited for the word of judgment. There was no mistaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sincerity--it breathed in every tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) voice. Both Marilla and Mrs. Lynde recognized its unmistakable ring. But the former under-stood in dismay that Anne was actually enjoying her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) valley of humiliation--was reveling in the thoroughness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) abasement. Where was the wholesome punishment upon which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), Marilla, had plumed herself? Anne had turned it into a species of positive pleasure. Good Mrs. Lynde, not being overburdened with perception, did not see this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) only perceived that Anne had made a very thorough apology and all resentment vanished from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) kindly, if somewhat officious, heart. <div class="bookquote">``There, there, get up, child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said heartily. '' Of course I forgive you. I guess I was a little too hard on you, anyway. But I'm such an outspoken person. You just mustn't mind me, that's what. It can't be denied your hair is terrible red; but I knew a girl once--went to school with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), in fact--whose hair was every mite as red as yours when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was young, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grew up it darkened to a real handsome auburn. I wouldn't be a mite surprised if yours did, too--not a mite.'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mrs. Lynde!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne drew a long breath as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``You have given me a hope. I shall always feel that you are a benefactor.
<p/>Oh, I could endure anything if I only thought my hair would be a handsome auburn when I grew up. It would be so much easier to be good if one's hair was a handsome auburn, don't you think? And now may I go out into your garden and sit on that bench under the apple-trees while you and Marilla are talking? There is so much more scope for imagination out there.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Laws, yes, run along, child. And you can pick a bouquet of them white June lilies over in the corner if you like.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div>As the door closed behind Anne Mrs. Lynde got briskly up to light a lamp. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>)'s a real odd little thing. Take this chair, Marilla; it's easier than the one you've got; I just keep that for the hired boy to sit on. Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) certainly is an odd child, but there is something kind of taking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) after all. I don't feel so surprised at you and Matthew keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) as I did--nor so sorry for you, either. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) may turn out all right. Of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) has a queer way of expressing herself--a little too-- well, too kind of forcible, you know; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'ll likely get over that now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s come to live among civilized folks. And then, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) temper's pretty quick, I guess; but there's one comfort, a child that has a quick temper, just blaze up and cool down, ain't never likely to be sly or deceitful. Preserve me from a sly child, that's what. On the whole, Marilla, I kind of like her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>When Marilla went home Anne came out of the fragrant twilight of the orchard with a sheaf of white narcissi in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``I apologized pretty well, didn't I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said proudly as they went down the lane. <div class="bookquote">``I thought since I had to do it I might as well do it thoroughly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You did it thoroughly, all right enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>was Marilla's comment. Marilla was dismayed at finding herself inclined to laugh over the recollection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had also an uneasy feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) ought to scold Anne for apologizing so well; but then, that was ridiculous! She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) compromised with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) conscience by saying severely: '' I hope you won't have occasion to make many more such apologies. I hope you'll try to control your temper now, Anne.'' <div class="bookquote">``That wouldn't be so hard if people wouldn't twit me about my looks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne with a sigh. <div class="bookquote">``I don't get cross about other things; but I'm so tired of being twitted about my hair and it just makes me boil right over. Do you suppose my hair will really be a handsome auburn when I grow up?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't think so much about your looks, Anne. I'm afraid you are a very vain little girl.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How can I be vain when I know I'm homely? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>protested Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I love pretty things; and I hate to look in the glass and see something that isn't pretty. It makes me feel so sorrowful--just as I feel when I look at any ugly thing. I pity it because it isn't beautiful.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Handsome is as handsome does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>quoted Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``I've had that said to me before, but I have my doubts about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>remarked skeptical Anne, sniffing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) narcissi. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, aren't these flowers sweet! It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde to give them to me. I have no hard feelings against Mrs. Lynde now. It gives you a lovely, comfortable feeling to apologize and be forgiven, doesn't it? Aren't the stars bright tonight?
<p/>If you could live in a star, which one would you pick? I'd like that lovely clear big one away over there above that dark hill.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Anne, do hold your tongue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, thoroughly worn out trying to follow the gyrations of Anne's thoughts. Anne said no more until they turned into their own lane. A little gypsy wind came down it to meet them, laden with the spicy perfume of young dew-wet ferns. Far up in the shadows a cheerful light gleamed out through the trees from the kitchen at Green Gables. Anne suddenly came close to Marilla and slipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand into the older woman's hard palm. <div class="bookquote">``It's lovely to be going home and know it's home,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I love Green Gables already, and I never loved any place before. No place ever seemed like home. Oh, Marilla, I'm so happy. I could pray right now and not find it a bit hard. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Something warm and pleasant welled up in Marilla's heart at touch of that thin little hand in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) own--a throb of the maternity she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had missed, perhaps. Its very unaccustomedness and sweetness disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) hastened to restore her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) sensations to their normal calm by inculcating a moral. <div class="bookquote">``If you'll be a good girl you'll always be happy, Anne. And you should never find it hard to say your prayers.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Saying one's prayers isn't exactly the same thing as praying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne meditatively. <div class="bookquote">``But I'm going to imagine that I'm the wind that is blowing up there in those tree tops.
<p/>When I get tired of the trees I'll imagine I'm gently waving down here in the ferns--and then I'll fly over to Mrs. Lynde's garden and set the flowers dancing--and then I'll go with one great swoop over the clover field--and then I'll blow over the Lake of Shining Waters and ripple it all up into little sparkling waves. Oh, there's so much scope for imagination in a wind! So I'll not talk any more just now, Marilla.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thanks be to goodness for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>breathed Marilla in devout relief. CHAPTER XI. Anne's Impressions of Sunday-School |WELL, how do you like them?'' said Marilla. Anne was standing in the gable room, looking solemnly at three new dresses spread out on the bed. One was of snuffy colored gingham which Marilla had been tempted to buy from a peddler the preceding summer because it looked so serviceable; one was of black-and-white checkered sateen which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had picked up at a bargain counter in the winter; and one was a stiff print of an ugly blue shade which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had purchased that week at a Carmody store. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had made them up herself, and they were all made alike-- plain skirts fulled tightly to plain waists, with sleeves as plain as waist and skirt and tight as sleeves could be. <div class="bookquote">``I'll imagine that I like them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne soberly. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want you to imagine it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, offended. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I can see you don't like the dresses! What is the matter with them? Aren't they neat and clean and new?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then why don't you like them?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They're--they're not--pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne reluctantly. <div class="bookquote">``Pretty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla sniffed. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't trouble my head about getting pretty dresses for you. I don't believe in pampering vanity, Anne, I'll tell you that right off.
<p/>Those dresses are good, sensible, serviceable dresses, without any frills or furbelows about them, and they're all you'll get this summer. The brown gingham and the blue print will do you for school when you begin to go. The sateen is for church and Sunday school. I'll expect you to keep them neat and clean and not to tear them. I should think you'd be grateful to get most anything after those skimpy wincey things you've been wearing.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am grateful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>protested Anne. <div class="bookquote">``But I'd be ever so much gratefuller if--if you'd made just one of them with puffed sleeves. Puffed sleeves are so fashionable now. It would give me such a thrill, Marilla, just to wear a dress with puffed sleeves.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, you'll have to do without your thrill. I hadn't any material to waste on puffed sleeves. I think they are ridiculous-looking things anyhow. I prefer the plain, sensible ones.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I'd rather look ridiculous when everybody else does than plain and sensible all by myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>persisted Anne mournfully. <div class="bookquote">``Trust you for that! Well, hang those dresses carefully up in your closet, and then sit down and learn the Sunday school lesson. I got a quarterly from Mr. Bell for you and you'll go to Sunday school tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, disappearing downstairs in high dudgeon. Anne clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands and looked at the dresses. <div class="bookquote">``I did hope there would be a white one with puffed sleeves,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) whispered disconsolately. <div class="bookquote">``I prayed for one, but I didn't much expect it on that account. I didn't suppose God would have time to bother about a little orphan girl's dress. I knew I'd just have to depend on Marilla for it.
<p/>Well, fortunately I can imagine that one of them is of snow-white muslin with lovely lace frills and three-puffed sleeves. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>The next morning warnings of a sick headache prevented Marilla from going to Sunday-school with Anne. <div class="bookquote">``You'll have to go down and call for Mrs. Lynde, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'ll see that you get into the right class. Now, mind you behave yourself properly. Stay to preaching afterwards and ask Mrs. Lynde to show you our pew. Here's a cent for collection. Don't stare at people and don't fidget. I shall expect you to tell me the text when you come home. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne started off irreproachable, arrayed in the stiff black-and-white sateen, which, while decent as regards length and certainly not open to the charge of skimpiness, contrived to emphasize every corner and angle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thin figure. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hat was a little, flat, glossy, new sailor, the extreme plainness of which had likewise much disappointed Anne, who had permitted herself secret visions of ribbon and flowers. The latter, however, were supplied before Anne reached the main road, for being confronted halfway down the lane with a golden frenzy of wind-stirred buttercups and a glory of wild roses, Anne promptly and liberally garlanded her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hat with a heavy wreath of them. Whatever other people might have thought of the result it satisfied Anne, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tripped gaily down the road, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ruddy head with its decoration of pink and yellow very proudly. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had reached Mrs. Lynde's house she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found that lady gone. Nothing daunted, Anne proceeded onward to the church alone.
<p/>In the porch she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found a crowd of little girls, all more or less gaily attired in whites and blues and pinks, and all staring with curious eyes at this stranger in their midst, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) extraordinary head adornment. Avonlea little girls had already heard queer stories about Anne. Mrs. Lynde said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had an awful temper; Jerry Buote, the hired boy at Green Gables, said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) talked all the time to herself or to the trees and flowers like a crazy girl. They looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and whispered to each other behind their quarterlies. Nobody made any friendly advances, then or later on when the opening exercises were over and Anne found herself in Miss Rogerson's class. Miss Rogerson was a middle-aged lady who had taught a Sunday-school class for twenty years. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rogerson</b></font>) method of teaching was to ask the printed questions from the quarterly and look sternly over its edge at the particular little girl she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought ought to answer the question. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked very often at Anne, and Anne, thanks to Marilla's drilling, answered promptly; but it may be questioned if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) understood very much about either question or answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not think she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) liked Miss Rogerson, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt very miserable; every other little girl in the class had puffed sleeves. Anne felt that life was really not worth living without puffed sleeves. '' Well, how did you like Sunday school? '' Marilla wanted to know when Anne came home. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wreath having faded, Anne had discarded it in the lane, so Marilla was spared the knowledge of that for a time. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't like it a bit. It was horrid.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Anne Shirley!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla rebukingly.
<p/>Anne sat down on the rocker with a long sigh, kissed one of Bonny's leaves, and waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand to a blossoming fuchsia. <div class="bookquote">``They might have been lonesome while I was away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) explained. '' And now about the Sunday school. I behaved well, just as you told me. Mrs. Lynde was gone, but I went right on myself. I went into the church, with a lot of other little girls, and I sat in the corner of a pew by the window while the opening exercises went on. Mr. Bell made an awfully long prayer. I would have been dreadfully tired before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) got through if I hadn't been sitting by that window. But it looked right out on the Lake of Shining Waters, so I just gazed at that and imagined all sorts of splendid things.'' <div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't have done anything of the sort. You should have listened to Mr. Bell.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) wasn't talking to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>protested Anne. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) was talking to God and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) didn't seem to be very much inter-ested in it, either. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) thought God was too far off though. There was a long row of white birches hanging over the lake and the sunshine fell down through them, `way, `way down, deep into the water. Oh, Marilla, it was like a beautiful dream! It gave me a thrill and I just said, `Thank you for it, God,' two or three times.'' <div class="bookquote">``Not out loud, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla anxiously. '' Oh, no, just under my breath. Well, Mr. Bell did get through at last and they told me to go into the classroom with Miss Rogerson's class. There were nine other girls in it. They all had puffed sleeves. I tried to imagine mine were puffed, too, but I couldn't.
<p/>Why couldn't I? It was as easy as could be to imagine they were puffed when I was alone in the east gable, but it was awfully hard there among the others who had really truly puffs.'' <div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't have been thinking about your sleeves in Sunday school. You should have been attending to the lesson. I hope you knew it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes; and I answered a lot of questions. Miss Rogerson asked ever so many. I don't think it was fair for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rogerson</b></font>) to do all the asking. There were lots I wanted to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Rogerson</b></font>), but I didn't like to because I didn't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Rogerson</b></font>) was a kindred spirit. Then all the other little girls recited a paraphrase. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rogerson</b></font>) asked me if I knew any. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Rogerson</b></font>) I didn't, but I could recite, `The Dog at His (<font color='blue'><b>Rogerson</b></font>) Master's Grave' if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rogerson</b></font>) liked. That's in the Third Royal Reader. It isn't a really truly religious piece of poetry, but it's so sad and melancholy that it might as well be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rogerson</b></font>) said it wouldn't do and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rogerson</b></font>) told me to learn the nineteenth paraphrase for next Sunday. I read it over in church afterwards and it's splendid. There are two lines in particular that just thrill me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Midian</b></font>)</div>`Quick as the slaughtered squadrons fell In Midian's evil day.' <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what `squadrons' means nor `Midian,' either, but it sounds so tragical. I can hardly wait until next Sunday to recite it. I'll practice it all the week. After Sunday school I asked Miss Rogerson--because Mrs. Lynde was too far away--to show me your pew. I sat just as still as I could and the text was Revelations, third chapter, second and third verses. It was a very long text.
<p/>If I was a minister I'd pick the short, snappy ones. The sermon was awfully long, too. I suppose the minister had to match it to the text. I didn't think he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) was a bit interesting. The trouble with him (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) seems to be that he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) hasn't enough imagination. I didn't listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) very much. I just let my thoughts run and I thought of the most surprising things. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla felt helplessly that all this should be sternly reproved, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) was hampered by the undeniable fact that some of the things Anne had said, especially about the minister's sermons and Mr. Bell's prayers, were what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) herself had really thought deep down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart for years, but had never given expression to. It almost seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) that those secret, unuttered, critical thoughts had suddenly taken visible and accusing shape and form in the person of this outspoken morsel of neglected humanity. CHAPTER XII. A Solemn Vow and Promise |IT was not until the next Friday that Marilla heard the story of the flower-wreathed hat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) came home from Mrs. Lynde's and called Anne to account. '' Anne, Mrs. Rachel says you went to church last Sunday with your hat rigged out ridiculous with roses and buttercups. What on earth put you up to such a caper? A pretty-looking object you must have been!'' '' Oh. I know pink and yellow aren't becoming to me,'' began Anne. '' Becoming fiddlesticks! It was putting flowers on your hat at all, no matter what color they were, that was ridiculous. You are the most aggravating child!'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't see why it's any more ridiculous to wear flowers on your hat than on your dress,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>protested Anne. <div class="bookquote">``Lots of little girls there had bouquets pinned on their dresses.
<p/>What's the difference? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla was not to be drawn from the safe concrete into dubious paths of the abstract. <div class="bookquote">``Don't answer me back like that, Anne. It was very silly of you to do such a thing. Never let me catch you at such a trick again. Mrs. Rachel says she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) would sink through the floor when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) saw you come in all rigged out like that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) couldn't get near enough to tell you to take them off till it was too late. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) says people talked about it something dreadful. Of course they would think I had no better sense than to let you go decked out like that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm so sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne, tears welling into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I never thought you'd mind. The roses and buttercups were so sweet and pretty I thought they'd look lovely on my hat. Lots of the little girls had artificial flowers on their hats. I'm afraid I'm going to be a dreadful trial to you. Maybe you'd better send me back to the asylum. That would be terrible; I don't think I could endure it; most likely I would go into consumption; I'm so thin as it is, you see. But that would be better than being a trial to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, vexed at herself for having made the child cry. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to send you back to the asylum, I'm sure. All I want is that you should behave like other little girls and not make yourself ridiculous. Don't cry any more. I've got some news for you. Diana Barry came home this afternoon.
<p/>I'm going up to see if I can borrow a skirt pattern from Mrs. Barry, and if you like you can come with me and get acquainted with Diana. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) feet, with clasped hands, the tears still glistening on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cheeks; the dish towel she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been hemming slipped unheeded to the floor. '' Oh, Marilla, I'm frightened--now that it has come I'm actually frightened. What if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) shouldn't like me! It would be the most tragical disappointment of my life.'' <div class="bookquote">``Now, don't get into a fluster. And I do wish you wouldn't use such long words. It sounds so funny in a little girl. I guess Diana 'll like you well enough. It's her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) mother you've got to reckon with. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) doesn't like you it won't matter how much Diana does. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) has heard about your outburst to Mrs. Lynde and going to church with buttercups round your hat I don't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>)'ll think of you. You must be polite and well behaved, and don't make any of your startling speeches. For pity's sake, if the child isn't actually trembling!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne was trembling. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face was pale and tense. '' Oh, Marilla, you'd be excited, too, if you were going to meet a little girl you hoped to be your bosom friend and whose mother mightn't like you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hastened to get her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hat. They went over to Orchard Slope by the short cut across the brook and up the firry hill grove. Mrs. Barry came to the kitchen door in answer to Marilla's knock. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) was a tall black-eyed, black-haired woman, with a very resolute mouth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had the reputation of being very strict with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) children. <div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Marilla?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) said cordially. <div class="bookquote">``Come in.
<p/>And this is the little girl you have adopted, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, this is Anne Shirley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``Spelled with an E,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>gasped Anne, who, tremulous and excited as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was, was determined there should be no misunderstanding on that important point. Mrs. Barry, not hearing or not comprehending, merely shook hands and said kindly: <div class="bookquote">``How are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am well in body although considerable rumpled up in spirit, thank you ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne gravely. Then aside to Marilla in an audible whisper, <div class="bookquote">``There wasn't anything startling in that, was there, Marilla? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Diana was sitting on the sofa, reading a book which she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) dropped when the callers entered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) was a very pretty little girl, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) mother's black eyes and hair, and rosy cheeks, and the merry expression which was her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) inheritance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``This is my little girl Diana,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barry</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Barry. <div class="bookquote">``Diana, you might take Anne out into the garden and show her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) your flowers.

I'm glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) has the prospect of a playmate--perhaps it will take her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) more out-of-doors. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>Outside in the garden, which was full of mellow sunset light streaming through the dark old firs to the west of it, stood Anne and Diana, gazing bashfully at each other over a clump of gorgeous tiger lilies. The Barry garden was a bowery wilderness of flowers which would have delighted Anne's heart at any time less fraught with destiny. It was encircled by huge old willows and tall firs, beneath which flourished flowers that loved the shade.
<p/>Prim, right-angled paths neatly bordered with clamshells, intersected it like moist red ribbons and in the beds between old-fashioned flowers ran riot. There were rosy bleeding-hearts and great splendid crimson peonies; white, fragrant narcissi and thorny, sweet Scotch roses; pink and blue and white columbines and lilac-tinted Bouncing Bets; clumps of southernwood and ribbon grass and mint; purple Adam-and-Eve, daffodils, and masses of sweet clover white with its delicate, fragrant, feathery sprays; scarlet lightning that shot its fiery lances over prim white musk-flowers; a garden it was where sunshine lingered and bees hummed, and winds, beguiled into loitering, purred and rustled. '' Oh, Diana,'' said Anne at last, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands and speaking almost in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``oh, do you think you can like me a little--enough to be my bosom friend? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Diana laughed. Diana always laughed before she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">``Why, I guess so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) said frankly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm awfully glad you've come to live at Green Gables. It will be jolly to have somebody to play with. There isn't any other girl who lives near enough to play with, and I've no sisters big enough. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Will you swear to be my friend forever and ever? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>demanded Anne eagerly. Diana looked shocked. <div class="bookquote">``Why it's dreadfully wicked to swear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) said rebukingly. '' Oh no, not my kind of swearing. There are two kinds, you know.'' <div class="bookquote">``I never heard of but one kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana doubtfully. <div class="bookquote">``There really is another. Oh, it isn't wicked at all. It just means vowing and promising solemnly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't mind doing that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>agreed Diana, relieved. <div class="bookquote">``How do you do it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We must join hands--so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne gravely. <div class="bookquote">``It ought to be over running water. We'll just imagine this path is running water. I'll repeat the oath first.
<p/>I solemnly swear to be faithful to my bosom friend, Diana Barry, as long as the sun and moon shall endure. Now you say it and put my name in.''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>Diana repeated the <div class="bookquote">``oath''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>with a laugh fore and aft. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``You're a queer girl, Anne. I heard before that you were queer. But I believe I'm going to like you real well. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>When Marilla and Anne went home Diana went with them as far as the log bridge. The two little girls walked with their arms about each other. At the brook they parted with many promises to spend the next afternoon together. '' Well, did you find Diana a kindred spirit?'' asked Marilla as they went up through the garden of Green Gables. <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>sighed Anne, blissfully unconscious of any sarcasm on Marilla's part. '' Oh Marilla, I'm the happiest girl on Prince Edward Island this very moment. I assure you I'll say my prayers with a right good-will tonight. Diana and I are going to build a playhouse in Mr. William Bell's birch grove tomorrow. Can I have those broken pieces of china that are out in the woodshed? Diana's birthday is in February and mine is in March. Don't you think that is a very strange coincidence? Diana is going to lend me a book to read. She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) says it's perfectly splendid and tremendously exciting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>)'s going to show me a place back in the woods where rice lilies grow. Don't you think Diana has got very soulful eyes? I wish I had soulful eyes. Diana is going to teach me to sing a song called `Nelly in the Hazel Dell.'
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>)'s going to give me a picture to put up in my room; it's a perfectly beautiful picture, she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) says--a lovely lady in a pale blue silk dress. A sewing-machine agent gave it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>). I wish I had something to give Diana. I'm an inch taller than Diana, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) is ever so much fatter; she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>)'d like to be thin because it's so much more graceful, but I'm afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) only said it to soothe my feelings. We're going to the shore some day to gather shells. We have agreed to call the spring down by the log bridge the Dryad's Bubble. Isn't that a perfectly elegant name? I read a story once about a spring called that. A dryad is sort of a grown-up fairy, I think.'' <div class="bookquote">``Well, all I hope is you won't talk Diana to death,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. '' But remember this in all your planning, Anne. You're not going to play all the time nor most of it. You'll have your work to do and it'll have to be done first. '' Anne's cup of happiness was full, and Matthew caused it to overflow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had just got home from a trip to the store at Carmody, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmody</b></font>) sheepishly produced a small parcel from his (<font color='blue'><b>Carmody</b></font>) pocket and handed it to Anne, with a deprecatory look at Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``I heard you say you liked chocolate sweeties, so I got you some,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmody</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Humph,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>sniffed Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``It'll ruin her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) teeth and stomach. There, there, child, don't look so dismal. You can eat those, since Matthew has gone and got them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)'d better have brought you peppermints. They're wholesomer. Don't sicken yourself eating all them at once now.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, indeed, I won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``I'll just eat one tonight, Marilla.

It's delightful to think I have something to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will say it for the child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla when Anne had gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gable, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) isn't stingy. I'm glad, for of all faults I detest stinginess in a child. Dear me, it's only three weeks since she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) came, and it seems as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'d been here always. I can't imagine the place without her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Now, don't be looking I told-you -so, Matthew. That's bad enough in a woman, but it isn't to be endured in a man. I'm perfectly willing to own up that I'm glad I consented to keep the child and that I'm getting fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but don't you rub it in, Matthew Cuthbert.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XIII. The Delights of Anticipation |IT'S time Anne was in to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sewing,'' said Marilla, glancing at the clock and then out into the yellow August afternoon where everything drowsed in the heat. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) stayed playing with Diana more than half an hour more 'n I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) leave to; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>)'s perched out there on the woodpile talking to Matthew, nineteen to the dozen, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) knows perfectly well she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) ought to be at her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) work. And of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)'s listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) like a perfect ninny. I never saw such an infatuated man. The more she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) talks and the odder the things she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) says, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s delighted evidently. Anne Shirley, you come right in here this minute, do you hear me!''
<p/>A series of staccato taps on the west window brought Anne flying in from the yard, eyes shining, cheeks faintly flushed with pink, unbraided hair streaming behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in a torrent of brightness. '' Oh, Marilla,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) exclaimed breathlessly, <div class="bookquote">``there's going to be a Sunday-school picnic next week--in Mr. Harmon Andrews's field, right near the lake of Shining Waters. And Mrs. Superintendent Bell and Mrs. Rachel Lynde are going to make ice cream--think of it, Marilla-- ice cream! And, oh, Marilla, can I go to it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just look at the clock, if you please, Anne. What time did I tell you to come in?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Two o'clock--but isn't it splendid about the picnic, Marilla? Please can I go? Oh, I've never been to a picnic-- I've dreamed of picnics, but I've never--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I told you to come at two o'clock. And it's a quarter to three. I'd like to know why you didn't obey me, Anne.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, I meant to, Marilla, as much as could be. But you have no idea how fascinating Idlewild is. And then, of course, I had to tell Matthew about the picnic. Matthew is such a sympathetic listener. Please can I go?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You'll have to learn to resist the fascination of Idle-whatever-you-call-it. When I tell you to come in at a certain time I mean that time and not half an hour later. And you needn't stop to discourse with sympathetic listeners on your way, either. As for the picnic, of course you can go. You're a Sunday-school scholar, and it's not likely I'd refuse to let you go when all the other little girls are going.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>'' But--but,'' faltered Anne, <div class="bookquote">``Diana says that everybody must take a basket of things to eat.
<p/>I can't cook, as you know, Marilla, and--and--I don't mind going to a picnic without puffed sleeves so much, but I'd feel terribly humiliated if I had to go without a basket. It's been preying on my mind ever since Diana told me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, it needn't prey any longer. I'll bake you a basket.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, you dear good Marilla. Oh, you are so kind to me. Oh, I'm so much obliged to you.'' Getting through with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``ohs''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne cast herself into Marilla's arms and rapturously kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) sallow cheek. It was the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) whole life that childish lips had voluntarily touched Marilla's face. Again that sudden sensation of startling sweetness thrilled her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) was secretly vastly pleased at Anne's impulsive caress, which was probably the reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said brusquely: <div class="bookquote">``There, there, never mind your kissing nonsense. I'd sooner see you doing strictly as you're told. As for cooking, I mean to begin giving you lessons in that some of these days. But you're so featherbrained, Anne, I've been waiting to see if you'd sober down a little and learn to be steady before I begin. You've got to keep your wits about you in cooking and not stop in the middle of things to let your thoughts rove all over creation. Now, get out your patchwork and have your square done before teatime.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do not like patchwork,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne dolefully, hunting out her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) workbasket and sitting down before a little heap of red and white diamonds with a sigh. <div class="bookquote">``I think some kinds of sewing would be nice; but there's no scope for imagination in patchwork. It's just one little seam after another and you never seem to be getting anywhere.
<p/>But of course I'd rather be Anne of Green Gables sewing patchwork than Anne of any other place with nothing to do but play. I wish time went as quick sewing patches as it does when I'm playing with Diana, though. Oh, we do have such elegant times, Marilla. I have to furnish most of the imagination, but I'm well able to do that. Diana is simply perfect in every other way. You know that little piece of land across the brook that runs up between our farm and Mr. Barry's. It belongs to Mr. William Bell, and right in the corner there is a little ring of white birch trees--the most romantic spot, Marilla. Diana and I have our playhouse there. We call it Idlewild. Isn't that a poetical name? I assure you it took me some time to think it out. I stayed awake nearly a whole night before I invented it. Then, just as I was dropping off to sleep, it came like an inspiration. Diana was enraptured when she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) heard it. We have got our house fixed up elegantly. You must come and see it, Marilla-- won't you? We have great big stones, all covered with moss, for seats, and boards from tree to tree for shelves. And we have all our dishes on them. Of course, they're all broken but it's the easiest thing in the world to imagine that they are whole. There's a piece of a plate with a spray of red and yellow ivy on it that is especially beautiful. We keep it in the parlor and we have the fairy glass there, too. The fairy glass is as lovely as a dream. Diana found it out in the woods behind their chicken house.
<p/>It's all full of rainbows--just little young rainbows that haven't grown big yet--and Diana's mother told her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) it was broken off a hanging lamp they once had. But it's nice to imagine the fairies lost it one night when they had a ball, so we call it the fairy glass. Matthew is going to make us a table. Oh, we have named that little round pool over in Mr. Barry's field Willowmere. I got that name out of the book Diana lent me. That was a thrilling book, Marilla. The heroine had five lovers. I'd be satisfied with one, wouldn't you? She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) was very handsome and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) went through great tribulations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) could faint as easy as anything. I'd love to be able to faint, wouldn't you, Marilla? It's so romantic. But I'm really very healthy for all I'm so thin. I believe I'm getting fatter, though. Don't you think I am? I look at my elbows every morning when I get up to see if any dimples are coming. Diana is having a new dress made with elbow sleeves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) is going to wear it to the picnic. Oh, I do hope it will be fine next Wednesday. I don't feel that I could endure the disappointment if anything happened to prevent me from getting to the picnic. I suppose I'd live through it, but I'm certain it would be a lifelong sorrow. It wouldn't matter if I got to a hundred picnics in after years; they wouldn't make up for missing this one. They're going to have boats on the Lake of Shining Waters--and ice cream, as I told you. I have never tasted ice cream. Diana tried to explain what it was like, but I guess ice cream is one of those things that are beyond imagination.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anne, you have talked even on for ten minutes by the clock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``Now, just for curiosity's sake, see if you can hold your tongue for the same length of time.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne held her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tongue as desired. But for the rest of the week she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) talked picnic and thought picnic and dreamed picnic. On Saturday it rained and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) worked herself up into such a frantic state lest it should keep on raining until and over Wednesday that Marilla made her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) sew an extra patchwork square by way of steadying her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) nerves. On Sunday Anne confided to Marilla on the way home from church that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) grew actually cold all over with excitement when the minister announced the picnic from the pulpit. '' Such a thrill as went up and down my back, Marilla! I don't think I'd ever really believed until then that there was honestly going to be a picnic. I couldn't help fearing I'd only imagined it. But when a minister says a thing in the pulpit you just have to believe it.'' <div class="bookquote">``You set your heart too much on things, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, with a sigh. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid there'll be a great many disappointments in store for you through life.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Marilla, looking forward to things is half the pleasure of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Anne. <div class="bookquote">``You mayn't get the things themselves; but nothing can prevent you from having the fun of looking forward to them. Mrs. Lynde says, `Blessed are they who expect nothing for they shall not be disappointed.' But I think it would be worse to expect nothing than to be disappointed. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla wore her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) amethyst brooch to church that day as usual. Marilla always wore her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) amethyst brooch to church.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) would have thought it rather sacrilegious to leave it off--as bad as forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) Bible or her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) collection dime. That amethyst brooch was Marilla's most treasured possession. A seafaring uncle had given it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) mother who in turn had bequeathed it to Marilla. It was an old-fashioned oval, containing a braid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) mother's hair, surrounded by a border of very fine amethysts. Marilla knew too little about precious stones to realize how fine the amethysts actually were; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) thought them very beautiful and was always pleasantly conscious of their violet shimmer at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) throat, above her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) good brown satin dress, even although she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) could not see it. Anne had been smitten with delighted admiration when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) first saw that brooch. '' Oh, Marilla, it's a perfectly elegant brooch. I don't know how you can pay attention to the sermon or the prayers when you have it on. I couldn't, I know. I think amethysts are just sweet. They are what I used to think diamonds were like. Long ago, before I had ever seen a diamond, I read about them and I tried to imagine what they would be like. I thought they would be lovely glimmering purple stones. When I saw a real diamond in a lady's ring one day I was so disappointed I cried. Of course, it was very lovely but it wasn't my idea of a diamond. Will you let me hold the brooch for one minute, Marilla? Do you think amethysts can be the souls of good violets?'' CHAPTER XIV. Anne's Confession |ON the Monday evening before the picnic Marilla came down from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) room with a troubled face. ''
<p/>Anne,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said to that small personage, who was shelling peas by the spotless table and singing, <div class="bookquote">``Nelly of the Hazel Dell''  (<font color='red'><b>that personage</b></font>)</div>with a vigor and expression that did credit to Diana's teaching, <div class="bookquote">``did you see anything of my amethyst brooch? I thought I stuck it in my pincushion when I came home from church yesterday evening, but I can't find it anywhere.''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I--I saw it this afternoon when you were away at the Aid Society,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne, a little slowly. <div class="bookquote">``I was passing your door when I saw it on the cushion, so I went in to look at it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did you touch it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla sternly. '' Y-e-e-s,'' admitted Anne, <div class="bookquote">``I took it up and I pinned it on my breast just to see how it would look.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You had no business to do anything of the sort. It's very wrong in a little girl to meddle. You shouldn't have gone into my room in the first place and you shouldn't have touched a brooch that didn't belong to you in the second. Where did you put it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I put it back on the bureau. I hadn't it on a minute. Truly, I didn't mean to meddle, Marilla. I didn't think about its being wrong to go in and try on the brooch; but I see now that it was and I'll never do it again. That's one good thing about me. I never do the same naughty thing twice.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You didn't put it back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``That brooch isn't anywhere on the bureau. You've taken it out or something, Anne.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I did put it back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne quickly--pertly, Marilla thought. <div class="bookquote">``I don't just remember whether I stuck it on the pincushion or laid it in the china tray. But I'm perfectly certain I put it back.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll go and have another look,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, determining to be just. <div class="bookquote">``If you put that brooch back it's there still. If it isn't I'll know you didn't , that's all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) room and made a thorough search, not only over the bureau but in every other place she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) thought the brooch might possibly be. It was not to be found and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) returned to the kitchen. <div class="bookquote">``Anne, the brooch is gone. By your own admission you were the last person to handle it. Now, what have you done with it? Tell me the truth at once. Did you take it out and lose it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I didn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne solemnly, meeting Marilla's angry gaze squarely. <div class="bookquote">``I never took the brooch out of your room and that is the truth, if I was to be led to the block for it--although I'm not very certain what a block is. So there, Marilla. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne's <div class="bookquote">``so there''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>was only intended to emphasize her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) assertion, but Marilla took it as a display of defiance. <div class="bookquote">``I believe you are telling me a falsehood, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said sharply. <div class="bookquote">``I know you are. There now, don't say anything more unless you are prepared to tell the whole truth. Go to your room and stay there until you are ready to confess.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Will I take the peas with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne meekly. '' No, I'll finish shelling them myself. Do as I bid you.'' When Anne had gone Marilla went about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) evening tasks in a very disturbed state of mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) was worried about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) valuable brooch. What if Anne had lost it? And how wicked of the child to deny having taken it, when anybody could see she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must have! With such an innocent face, too!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what I wouldn't sooner have had happen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>thought Marilla, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) nervously shelled the peas. <div class="bookquote">``Of course, I don't suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) meant to steal it or anything like that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s just taken it to play with or help along that imagination of hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) must have taken it, that's clear, for there hasn't been a soul in that room since she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) was in it, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) own story, until I went up tonight. And the brooch is gone, there's nothing surer. I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) has lost it and is afraid to own up for fear she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'ll be punished. It's a dreadful thing to think she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) tells falsehoods. It's a far worse thing than her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) fit of temper. It's a fearful responsibility to have a child in your house you can't trust. Slyness and untruthfulness--that's what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) has displayed. I declare I feel worse about that than about the brooch. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'d only have told the truth about it I wouldn't mind so much.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) room at intervals all through the evening and searched for the brooch, without finding it. A bedtime visit to the east gable produced no result. Anne persisted in denying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew anything about the brooch but Marilla was only the more firmly convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) did. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) told Matthew the story the next morning. Matthew was confounded and puzzled; he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) could not so quickly lose faith in Anne but he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had to admit that circumstances were against her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You're sure it hasn't fell down behind the bureau?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was the only suggestion he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) could offer. <div class="bookquote">``I've moved the bureau and I've taken out the drawers and I've looked in every crack and cranny''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>was Marilla's positive answer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The brooch is gone and that child has taken it and lied about it. That's the plain, ugly truth, Matthew Cuthbert, and we might as well look it in the face.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well now, what are you going to do about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>Matthew asked forlornly, feeling secretly thankful that Marilla and not he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had to deal with the situation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) felt no desire to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) oar in this time. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'ll stay in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) room until she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) confesses,'' said Marilla grimly, remembering the success of this method in the former case. <div class="bookquote">``Then we'll see. Perhaps we'll be able to find the brooch if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'ll only tell where she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) took it; but in any case she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'ll have to be severely punished, Matthew.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well now, you'll have to punish her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew, reaching for his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) hat. <div class="bookquote">``I've nothing to do with it, remember. You warned me off yourself. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla felt deserted by everyone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) could not even go to Mrs. Lynde for advice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) went up to the east gable with a very serious face and left it with a face more serious still. Anne steadfastly refused to confess. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) persisted in asserting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had not taken the brooch. The child had evidently been crying and Marilla felt a pang of pity which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) sternly repressed. By night she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) was, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) expressed it, <div class="bookquote">``beat out.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You'll stay in this room until you confess, Anne. You can make up your mind to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said firmly. '' But the picnic is tomorrow, Marilla,'' cried Anne. <div class="bookquote">``You won't keep me from going to that, will you? You'll just let me out for the afternoon, won't you? Then I'll stay here as long as you like afterwards cheerfully. But I must go to the picnic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll not go to picnics nor anywhere else until you've confessed, Anne.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>gasped Anne. But Marilla had gone out and shut the door. Wednesday morning dawned as bright and fair as if expressly made to order for the picnic. Birds sang around Green Gables; the Madonna lilies in the garden sent out whiffs of perfume that entered in on viewless winds at every door and window, and wandered through halls and rooms like spirits of benediction. The birches in the hollow waved joyful hands as if watching for Anne's usual morning greeting from the east gable. But Anne was not at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) window. When Marilla took her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) breakfast up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) found the child sitting primly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) bed, pale and resolute, with tight-shut lips and gleaming eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Marilla, I'm ready to confess.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla laid down her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) tray. Once again her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) method had succeeded; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) success was very bitter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>). '' Let me hear what you have to say then, Anne.'' <div class="bookquote">``I took the amethyst brooch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne, as if repeating a lesson she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had learned. <div class="bookquote">``I took it just as you said. I didn't mean to take it when I went in. But it did look so beautiful, Marilla, when I pinned it on my breast that I was overcome by an irresistible temptation. I imagined how perfectly thrilling it would be to take it to Idlewild and play I was the Lady Cordelia Fitzgerald. It would be so much easier to imagine I was the Lady Cordelia if I had a real amethyst brooch on. Diana and I make necklaces of roseberries but what are roseberries compared to amethysts? So I took the brooch. I thought I could put it back before you came home.
<p/>I went all the way around by the road to lengthen out the time. When I was going over the bridge across the Lake of Shining Waters I took the brooch off to have another look at it. Oh, how it did shine in the sunlight! And then, when I was leaning over the bridge, it just slipped through my fingers--so--and went down--down--down, all purply-sparkling, and sank forevermore beneath the Lake of Shining Waters. And that's the best I can do at confessing, Marilla. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla felt hot anger surge up into her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) heart again. This child had taken and lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) treasured amethyst brooch and now sat there calmly reciting the details thereof without the least apparent compunction or repentance. <div class="bookquote">``Anne, this is terrible,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, trying to speak calmly. <div class="bookquote">``You are the very wickedest girl I ever heard of.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I suppose I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>agreed Anne tranquilly. '' And I know I'll have to be punished. It'll be your duty to punish me, Marilla. Won't you please get it over right off because I'd like to go to the picnic with nothing on my mind.'' <div class="bookquote">``Picnic, indeed! You'll go to no picnic today, Anne Shirley. That shall be your punishment. And it isn't half severe enough either for what you've done!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not go to the picnic!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne sprang to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) feet and clutched Marilla's hand. '' But you promised me I might! Oh, Marilla, I must go to the picnic. That was why I confessed. Punish me any way you like but that. Oh, Marilla, please, please, let me go to the picnic. Think of the ice cream! For anything you know I may never have a chance to taste ice cream again.'' Marilla disengaged Anne's clinging hands stonily. <div class="bookquote">``You needn't plead, Anne.
<p/>You are not going to the picnic and that's final. No, not a word.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne realized that Marilla was not to be moved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) hands together, gave a piercing shriek, and then flung herself face downward on the bed, crying and writhing in an utter abandonment of disappointment and despair. '' For the land's sake!'' gasped Marilla, hastening from the room. <div class="bookquote">``I believe the child is crazy. No child in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) senses would behave as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) does. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s utterly bad. Oh dear, I'm afraid Rachel was right from the first. But I've put my hand to the plow and I won't look back. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That was a dismal morning. Marilla worked fiercely and scrubbed the porch floor and the dairy shelves when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) could find nothing else to do. Neither the shelves nor the porch needed it--but Marilla did. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) went out and raked the yard. When dinner was ready she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) went to the stairs and called Anne. A tear-stained face appeared, looking tragically over the banisters. <div class="bookquote">``Come down to your dinner, Anne.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't want any dinner, Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne, sobbingly. <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't eat anything. My heart is broken. You'll feel remorse of conscience someday, I expect, for breaking it, Marilla, but I forgive you. Remember when the time comes that I forgive you. But please don't ask me to eat anything, especially boiled pork and greens. Boiled pork and greens are so unromantic when one is in affliction. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Exasperated, Marilla returned to the kitchen and poured out her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) tale of woe to Matthew, who, between his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) sense of justice and his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) unlawful sympathy with Anne, was a miserable man. ''
<p/>Well now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) shouldn't have taken the brooch, Marilla, or told stories about it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) admitted, mournfully surveying his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) plateful of unromantic pork and greens as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>), like Anne, thought it a food unsuited to crises of feeling, <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'s such a little thing--such an interesting little thing. Don't you think it's pretty rough not to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) go to the picnic when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'s so set on it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Matthew Cuthbert, I'm amazed at you. I think I've let her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) off entirely too easy. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) doesn't appear to realize how wicked she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'s been at all--that's what worries me most. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'d really felt sorry it wouldn't be so bad. And you don't seem to realize it, neither; you're making excuses for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) all the time to yourself--I can see that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'s such a little thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>feebly reiterated Matthew. '' And there should be allowances made, Marilla. You know she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s never had any bringing up.'' <div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s having it now''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>retorted Marilla. The retort silenced Matthew if it did not convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>). That dinner was a very dismal meal. The only cheerful thing about it was Jerry Buote, the hired boy, and Marilla resented his (<font color='blue'><b>Buote</b></font>) cheerfulness as a personal insult. When her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) dishes were washed and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) bread sponge set and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) hens fed Marilla remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had noticed a small rent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) best black lace shawl when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had taken it off on Monday afternoon on returning from the Ladies' Aid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) would go and mend it. The shawl was in a box in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) trunk. As Marilla lifted it out, the sunlight, falling through the vines that clustered thickly about the window, struck upon something caught in the shawl--something that glittered and sparkled in facets of violet light.
<p/>Marilla snatched at it with a gasp. It was the amethyst brooch, hanging to a thread of the lace by its catch! '' Dear life and heart,'' said Marilla blankly, <div class="bookquote">``what does this mean? Here's my brooch safe and sound that I thought was at the bottom of Barry's pond. Whatever did that girl mean by saying she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) took it and lost it? I declare I believe Green Gables is bewitched. I remember now that when I took off my shawl Monday afternoon I laid it on the bureau for a minute. I suppose the brooch got caught in it somehow. Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla betook herself to the east gable, brooch in hand. Anne had cried herself out and was sitting dejectedly by the window. '' Anne Shirley,'' said Marilla solemnly, <div class="bookquote">``I've just found my brooch hanging to my black lace shawl. Now I want to know what that rigmarole you told me this morning meant. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, you said you'd keep me here until I confessed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>returned Anne wearily, <div class="bookquote">``and so I decided to confess because I was bound to get to the picnic. I thought out a confession last night after I went to bed and made it as interesting as I could. And I said it over and over so that I wouldn't forget it. But you wouldn't let me go to the picnic after all, so all my trouble was wasted. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Marilla had to laugh in spite of herself. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) conscience pricked her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>). '' Anne, you do beat all! But I was wrong-- I see that now. I shouldn't have doubted your word when I'd never known you to tell a story. Of course, it wasn't right for you to confess to a thing you hadn't done--it was very wrong to do so.
<p/>But I drove you to it. So if you'll forgive me, Anne, I'll forgive you and we'll start square again. And now get yourself ready for the picnic. '' Anne flew up like a rocket. '' Oh, Marilla, isn't it too late?'' <div class="bookquote">``No, it's only two o'clock. They won't be more than well gathered yet and it'll be an hour before they have tea. Wash your face and comb your hair and put on your gingham. I'll fill a basket for you. There's plenty of stuff baked in the house. And I'll get Jerry to hitch up the sorrel and drive you down to the picnic ground.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Anne, flying to the washstand. '' Five minutes ago I was so miserable I was wishing I'd never been born and now I wouldn't change places with an angel!'' That night a thoroughly happy, completely tired-out Anne returned to Green Gables in a state of beatification impossible to describe. '' Oh, Marilla, I've had a perfectly scrumptious time. Scrumptious is a new word I learned today. I heard Mary Alice Bell use it. Isn't it very expressive? Everything was lovely. We had a splendid tea and then Mr. Harmon Andrews took us all for a row on the Lake of Shining Waters--six of us at a time. And Jane Andrews nearly fell overboard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) was leaning out to pick water lilies and if Mr. Andrews hadn't caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) sash just in the nick of time she (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>)'d fallen in and prob`ly been drowned. I wish it had been me. It would have been such a romantic experience to have been nearly drowned. It would be such a thrilling tale to tell. And we had the ice cream. Words fail me to describe that ice cream.
<p/>Marilla, I assure you it was sublime.'' That evening Marilla told the whole story to Matthew over her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) stocking basket. <div class="bookquote">``I'm willing to own up that I made a mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) concluded candidly, <div class="bookquote">``but I've learned a lesson. I have to laugh when I think of Anne's `confession,' although I suppose I shouldn't for it really was a falsehood. But it doesn't seem as bad as the other would have been, somehow, and anyhow I'm responsible for it. That child is hard to understand in some respects. But I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'ll turn out all right yet. And there's one thing certain, no house will ever be dull that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'s in.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XV. A Tempest in the School Teapot |WHAT a splendid day!'' said Anne, drawing a long breath. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't it good just to be alive on a day like this? I pity the people who aren't born yet for missing it. They may have good days, of course, but they can never have this one. And it's splendider still to have such a lovely way to go to school by, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's a lot nicer than going round by the road; that is so dusty and hot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana practically, peeping into her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) dinner basket and mentally calculating if the three juicy, toothsome, raspberry tarts reposing there were divided among ten girls how many bites each girl would have. The little girls of Avonlea school always pooled their lunches, and to eat three raspberry tarts all alone or even to share them only with one's best chum would have forever and ever branded as <div class="bookquote">``awful mean''  (<font color='red'><b>chum</b></font>)</div>the girl who did it. And yet, when the tarts were divided among ten girls you just got enough to tantalize you.
<p/>The way Anne and Diana went to school was a pretty one. Anne thought those walks to and from school with Diana couldn't be improved upon even by imagination. Going around by the main road would have been so unromantic; but to go by Lover's Lane and Willowmere and Violet Vale and the Birch Path was romantic, if ever anything was. Lover's Lane opened out below the orchard at Green Gables and stretched far up into the woods to the end of the Cuthbert farm. It was the way by which the cows were taken to the back pasture and the wood hauled home in winter. Anne had named it Lover's Lane before she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been a month at Green Gables. <div class="bookquote">``Not that lovers ever really walk there,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) explained to Marilla, <div class="bookquote">``but Diana and I are reading a perfectly magnificent book and there's a Lover's Lane in it. So we want to have one, too. And it's a very pretty name, don't you think? So romantic! We can't imagine the lovers into it, you know. I like that lane because you can think out loud there without people calling you crazy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Anne, starting out alone in the morning, went down Lover's Lane as far as the brook. Here Diana met her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>), and the two little girls went on up the lane under the leafy arch of maples--<div class="bookquote">``maples are such sociable trees,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>said Anne; <div class="bookquote">``they're always rustling and whispering to you'' (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>--until they came to a rustic bridge. Then they left the lane and walked through Mr. Barry's back field and past Willowmere. Beyond Willowmere came Violet Vale--a little green dimple in the shadow of Mr. Andrew Bell's big woods. <div class="bookquote">``Of course there are no violets there now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne told Marilla, <div class="bookquote">``but Diana says there are millions of them in spring.
<p/>Oh, Marilla, can't you just imagine you see them? It actually takes away my breath. I named it Violet Vale. Diana says she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) never saw the beat of me for hitting on fancy names for places. It's nice to be clever at something, isn't it? But Diana named the Birch Path. She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) wanted to, so I let her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>); but I'm sure I could have found something more poetical than plain Birch Path. Anybody can think of a name like that. But the Birch Path is one of the prettiest places in the world, Marilla. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>It was. Other people besides Anne thought so when they stumbled on it. It was a little narrow, twisting path, winding down over a long hill straight through Mr. Bell's woods, where the light came down sifted through so many emerald screens that it was as flawless as the heart of a diamond. It was fringed in all its length with slim young birches, white stemmed and lissom boughed; ferns and starflowers and wild lilies-of-the-valley and scarlet tufts of pigeonberries grew thickly along it; and always there was a delightful spiciness in the air and music of bird calls and the murmur and laugh of wood winds in the trees overhead. Now and then you might see a rabbit skipping across the road if you were quiet--which, with Anne and Diana, happened about once in a blue moon. Down in the valley the path came out to the main road and then it was just up the spruce hill to the school.
<p/>The Avonlea school was a whitewashed building, low in the eaves and wide in the windows, furnished inside with comfortable substantial old-fashioned desks that opened and shut, and were carved all over their lids with the initials and hieroglyphics of three generations of school children. The schoolhouse was set back from the road and behind it was a dusky fir wood and a brook where all the children put their bottles of milk in the morning to keep cool and sweet until dinner hour. Marilla had seen Anne start off to school on the first day of September with many secret misgivings. Anne was such an odd girl. How would she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) get on with the other children? And how on earth would she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ever manage to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tongue during school hours? Things went better than Marilla feared, however. Anne came home that evening in high spirits. <div class="bookquote">``I think I'm going to like school here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) announced. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think much of the master, through. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'s all the time curling his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) mustache and making eyes at Prissy Andrews. Prissy is grown up, you know. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'s sixteen and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'s studying for the entrance examination into Queen's Academy at Charlottetown next year. Tillie Boulter says the master is dead gone on her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)'s got a beautiful complexion and curly brown hair and she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) does it up so elegantly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) sits in the long seat at the back and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sits there, too, most of the time--to explain her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) lessons, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) says. But Ruby Gillis says she (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) writing something on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) slate and when Prissy read it she (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) blushed as red as a beet and giggled; and Ruby Gillis says she (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) doesn't believe it had anything to do with the lesson.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anne Shirley, don't let me hear you talking about your teacher in that way again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla sharply. <div class="bookquote">``You don't go to school to criticize the master. I guess he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) can teach you something, and it's your business to learn. And I want you to understand right off that you are not to come home telling tales about him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). That is something I won't encourage. I hope you were a good girl.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne comfortably. <div class="bookquote">``It wasn't so hard as you might imagine, either. I sit with Diana. Our seat is right by the window and we can look down to the Lake of Shining Waters. There are a lot of nice girls in school and we had scrumptious fun playing at dinnertime. It's so nice to have a lot of little girls to play with. But of course I like Diana best and always will. I adore Diana. I'm dreadfully far behind the others. They're all in the fifth book and I'm only in the fourth. I feel that it's kind of a disgrace. But there's not one of them has such an imagination as I have and I soon found that out. We had reading and geography and Canadian history and dictation today. Mr. Phillips said my spelling was disgraceful and he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) held up my slate so that everybody could see it, all marked over. I felt so mortified, Marilla; he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) might have been politer to a stranger, I think. Ruby Gillis gave me an apple and Sophia Sloane lent me a lovely pink card with `May I see you home?' on it. I'm to give it back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) tomorrow. And Tillie Boulter let me wear her (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) bead ring all the afternoon.
<p/>Can I have some of those pearl beads off the old pincushion in the garret to make myself a ring? And oh, Marilla, Jane Andrews told me that Minnie MacPherson told her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) heard Prissy Andrews tell Sara Gillis that I had a very pretty nose. Marilla, that is the first compliment I have ever had in my life and you can't imagine what a strange feeling it gave me. Marilla, have I really a pretty nose? I know you'll tell me the truth.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your nose is well enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla shortly. Secretly she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) thought Anne's nose was a remarkable pretty one; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had no intention of telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) so. That was three weeks ago and all had gone smoothly so far. And now, this crisp September morning, Anne and Diana were tripping blithely down the Birch Path, two of the happiest little girls in Avonlea. <div class="bookquote">``I guess Gilbert Blythe will be in school today,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>)'s been visiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) cousins over in New Brunswick all summer and he (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) only came home Saturday night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>)'s aw`fly handsome, Anne. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) teases the girls something terrible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) just torments our lives out. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>Diana's voice indicated that she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) rather liked having her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) life tormented out than not. '' Gilbert Blythe? '' said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't his (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) name that's written up on the porch wall with Julia Bell's and a big `Take Notice' over them?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana, tossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``but I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) doesn't like Julia Bell so very much. I've heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) say he (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) studied the multiplication table by her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) freckles.''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't speak about freckles to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>implored Anne. <div class="bookquote">``It isn't delicate when I've got so many.
<p/>But I do think that writing take-notices up on the wall about the boys and girls is the silliest ever. I should just like to see anybody dare to write my name up with a boy's. Not, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hastened to add, <div class="bookquote">``that anybody would. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Anne sighed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) didn't want her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) name written up. But it was a little humiliating to know that there was no danger of it. '' Nonsense,'' said Diana, whose black eyes and glossy tresses had played such havoc with the hearts of Avonlea schoolboys that her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) name figured on the porch walls in half a dozen take-notices. <div class="bookquote">``It's only meant as a joke. And don't you be too sure your name won't ever be written up. Charlie Sloane is dead gone on you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sloane</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Sloane</b></font>) mother--his (<font color='blue'><b>Sloane</b></font>) mother , mind you--that you were the smartest girl in school. That's better than being good looking.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, it isn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne, feminine to the core. <div class="bookquote">``I'd rather be pretty than clever. And I hate Charlie Sloane, I can't bear a boy with goggle eyes. If anyone wrote my name up with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) I'd never get over it, Diana Barry. But it is nice to keep head of your class.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You'll have Gilbert in your class after this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>)'s used to being head of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) class, I can tell you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>)'s only in the fourth book although he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>)'s nearly fourteen. Four years ago his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) father was sick and had to go out to Alberta for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) health and Gilbert went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>). They were there three years and Gil didn't go to school hardly any until they came back. You won't find it so easy to keep head after this, Anne.''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne quickly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't really feel proud of keeping head of little boys and girls of just nine or ten. I got up yesterday spelling `ebullition.' Josie Pye was head and, mind you, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) peeped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) book. Mr. Phillips didn't see her (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) was looking at Prissy Andrews--but I did. I just swept her (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) a look of freezing scorn and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) got as red as a beet and spelled it wrong after all.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Those Pye girls are cheats all round,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana indignantly, as they climbed the fence of the main road. '' Gertie Pye actually went and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) milk bottle in my place in the brook yesterday. Did you ever? I don't speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) now.'' When Mr. Phillips was in the back of the room hearing Prissy Andrews's Latin, Diana whispered to Anne, '' That's Gilbert Blythe sitting right across the aisle from you, Anne. Just look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) and see if you don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>)'s handsome. '' Anne looked accordingly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had a good chance to do so, for the said Gilbert Blythe was absorbed in stealthily pinning the long yellow braid of Ruby Gillis, who sat in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>), to the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) seat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) was a tall boy, with curly brown hair, roguish hazel eyes, and a mouth twisted into a teasing smile. Presently Ruby Gillis started up to take a sum to the master; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) fell back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) seat with a little shriek, believing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) hair was pulled out by the roots. Everybody looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) and Mr. Phillips glared so sternly that Ruby began to cry. Gilbert had whisked the pin out of sight and was studying his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) history with the soberest face in the world; but when the commotion subsided he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) looked at Anne and winked with inexpressible drollery.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think your Gilbert Blythe is handsome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>confided Anne to Diana, <div class="bookquote">``but I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>)'s very bold. It isn't good manners to wink at a strange girl.''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>But it was not until the afternoon that things really began to happen. Mr. Phillips was back in the corner explaining a problem in algebra to Prissy Andrews and the rest of the scholars were doing pretty much as they pleased eating green apples, whispering, drawing pictures on their slates, and driving crickets harnessed to strings, up and down aisle. Gilbert Blythe was trying to make Anne Shirley look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) and failing utterly, because Anne was at that moment totally oblivious not only to the very existence of Gilbert Blythe, but of every other scholar in Avonlea school itself. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) chin propped on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes fixed on the blue glimpse of the Lake of Shining Waters that the west window afforded, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was far away in a gorgeous dreamland hearing and seeing nothing save her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own wonderful visions. Gilbert Blythe wasn't used to putting himself out to make a girl look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) and meeting with failure. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>), that red-haired Shirley girl with the little pointed chin and the big eyes that weren't like the eyes of any other girl in Avonlea school. Gilbert reached across the aisle, picked up the end of Anne's long red braid, held it out at arm's length and said in a piercing whisper: <div class="bookquote">``Carrots! Carrots!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Then Anne looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) with a vengeance! She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did more than look. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sprang to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) feet, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) bright fancies fallen into cureless ruin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) flashed one indignant glance at Gilbert from eyes whose angry sparkle was swiftly quenched in equally angry tears. <div class="bookquote">``You mean, hateful boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) exclaimed passionately.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How dare you!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And then--thwack! Anne had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) slate down on Gilbert's head and cracked it--slate not head--clear across. Avonlea school always enjoyed a scene. This was an especially enjoyable one. Everybody said <div class="bookquote">``Oh''  (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div>in horrified delight. Diana gasped. Ruby Gillis, who was inclined to be hysterical, began to cry. Tommy Sloane let his (<font color='blue'><b>Sloane</b></font>) team of crickets escape him (<font color='blue'><b>Sloane</b></font>) altogether while he (<font color='blue'><b>Sloane</b></font>) stared open-mouthed at the tableau. Mr. Phillips stalked down the aisle and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) hand heavily on Anne's shoulder. '' Anne Shirley, what does this mean?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) said angrily. Anne returned no answer. It was asking too much of flesh and blood to expect her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to tell before the whole school that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been called <div class="bookquote">``carrots.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Gilbert it was who spoke up stoutly. <div class="bookquote">``It was my fault Mr. Phillips. I teased her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Phillips</b></font>)</div>Mr. Phillips paid no heed to Gilbert. <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to see a pupil of mine displaying such a temper and such a vindictive spirit,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) said in a solemn tone, as if the mere fact of being a pupil of his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) ought to root out all evil passions from the hearts of small imperfect mortals. <div class="bookquote">``Anne, go and stand on the platform in front of the blackboard for the rest of the afternoon. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne would have infinitely preferred a whipping to this punishment under which her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sensitive spirit quivered as from a whiplash. With a white, set face she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) obeyed. Mr. Phillips took a chalk crayon and wrote on the blackboard above her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head. '' Ann Shirley has a very bad temper. Ann Shirley must learn to control her (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) temper,'' and then read it out loud so that even the primer class, who couldn't read writing, should understand it. Anne stood there the rest of the afternoon with that legend above her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not cry or hang her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head. Anger was still too hot in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart for that and it sustained her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) amid all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) agony of humiliation. With resentful eyes and passion-red cheeks she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) confronted alike Diana's sympathetic gaze and Charlie Sloane's indignant nods and Josie Pye's malicious smiles. As for Gilbert Blythe, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) would not even look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) would never look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) again! She (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) would never speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>)!! When school was dismissed Anne marched out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) red head held high. Gilbert Blythe tried to intercept her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) at the porch door. <div class="bookquote">``I'm awfully sorry I made fun of your hair, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) whispered contritely. '' Honest I am. Don't be mad for keeps, now.'' Anne swept by disdainfully, without look or sign of hearing. '' Oh how could you, Anne?'' breathed Diana as they went down the road half reproachfully, half admiringly. Diana felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) could never have resisted Gilbert's plea. <div class="bookquote">``I shall never forgive Gilbert Blythe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne firmly. '' And Mr. Phillips spelled my name without an e, too. The iron has entered into my soul, Diana. '' Diana hadn't the least idea what Anne meant but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) understood it was something terrible. <div class="bookquote">``You mustn't mind Gilbert making fun of your hair,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said soothingly. '' Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) makes fun of all the girls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) laughs at mine because it's so black. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>)'s called me a crow a dozen times; and I never heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) apologize for anything before, either.'' <div class="bookquote">``There's a great deal of difference between being called a crow and being called carrots,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne with dignity. '' Gilbert Blythe has hurt my feelings excruciatingly , Diana. '' It is possible the matter might have blown over without more excruciation if nothing else had happened.
<p/>But when things begin to happen they are apt to keep on. Avonlea scholars often spent noon hour picking gum in Mr. Bell's spruce grove over the hill and across his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) big pasture field. From there they could keep an eye on Eben Wright's house, where the master boarded. When they saw Mr. Phillips emerging therefrom they ran for the schoolhouse; but the distance being about three times longer than Mr. Wright's lane they were very apt to arrive there, breathless and gasping, some three minutes too late. On the following day Mr. Phillips was seized with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) spasmodic fits of reform and announced before going home to dinner, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) should expect to find all the scholars in their seats when he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) returned. Anyone who came in late would be punished. All the boys and some of the girls went to Mr. Bell's spruce grove as usual, fully intending to stay only long enough to <div class="bookquote">``pick a chew.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bell/Bell/Mr. William Bell</b></font>)</div>But spruce groves are seductive and yellow nuts of gum beguiling; they picked and loitered and strayed; and as usual the first thing that recalled them to a sense of the flight of time was Jimmy Glover shouting from the top of a patriarchal old spruce <div class="bookquote">``Master's coming. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jimmy Glover</b></font>)</div>The girls who were on the ground, started first and managed to reach the schoolhouse in time but without a second to spare. The boys, who had to wriggle hastily down from the trees, were later; and Anne, who had not been picking gum at all but was wandering happily in the far end of the grove, waist deep among the bracken, singing softly to herself, with a wreath of rice lilies on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hair as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) were some wild divinity of the shadowy places, was latest of all.
<p/>Anne could run like a deer, however; run she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did with the impish result that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) overtook the boys at the door and was swept into the schoolhouse among them just as Mr. Phillips was in the act of hanging up his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) hat. Mr. Phillips's brief reforming energy was over; he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) didn't want the bother of punishing a dozen pupils; but it was necessary to do something to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) word, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) looked about for a scapegoat and found it in Anne, who had dropped into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) seat, gasping for breath, with a forgotten lily wreath hanging askew over one ear and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) a particularly rakish and disheveled appearance. '' Anne Shirley, since you seem to be so fond of the boys' company we shall indulge your taste for it this afternoon,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) said sarcastically. <div class="bookquote">``Take those flowers out of your hair and sit with Gilbert Blythe. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The boys</b></font>)</div>The other boys snickered. Diana, turning pale with pity, plucked the wreath from Anne's hair and squeezed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand. Anne stared at the master as if turned to stone. '' Did you hear what I said, Anne? '' queried Mr. Phillips sternly. '' Yes, sir,'' said Anne slowly '' but I didn't suppose you really meant it.'' <div class="bookquote">``I assure you I did'' (<font color='red'><b>the children Anne</b></font>)</div>--still with the sarcastic inflection which all the children, and Anne especially, hated. It flicked on the raw. '' Obey me at once. '' For a moment Anne looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) meant to disobey. Then, realizing that there was no help for it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) rose haughtily, stepped across the aisle, sat down beside Gilbert Blythe, and buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) arms on the desk.
<p/>Ruby Gillis, who got a glimpse of it as it went down, told the others going home from school that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>)'d <div class="bookquote">``acksually never seen anything like it--it was so white, with awful little red spots in it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>To Anne, this was as the end of all things. It was bad enough to be singled out for punishment from among a dozen equally guilty ones; it was worse still to be sent to sit with a boy, but that that boy should be Gilbert Blythe was heaping insult on injury to a degree utterly unbearable. Anne felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not bear it and it would be of no use to try. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) whole being seethed with shame and anger and humiliation. At first the other scholars looked and whispered and giggled and nudged. But as Anne never lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head and as Gilbert worked fractions as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) whole soul was absorbed in them and them only, they soon returned to their own tasks and Anne was forgotten. When Mr. Phillips called the history class out Anne should have gone, but Anne did not move, and Mr. Phillips, who had been writing some verses <div class="bookquote">``To Priscilla''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Phillips</b></font>)</div>before he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) called the class, was thinking about an obstinate rhyme still and never missed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Once, when nobody was looking, Gilbert took from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) desk a little pink candy heart with a gold motto on it, <div class="bookquote">``You are sweet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gilbert/Gilbert Blythe/Blythe</b></font>)</div>and slipped it under the curve of Anne's arm. Whereupon Anne arose, took the pink heart gingerly between the tips of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) fingers, dropped it on the floor, ground it to powder beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heel, and resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) position without deigning to bestow a glance on Gilbert.
<p/>When school went out Anne marched to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) desk, ostentatiously took out everything therein, books and writing tablet, pen and ink, testament and arithmetic, and piled them neatly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cracked slate. <div class="bookquote">``What are you taking all those things home for, Anne? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>Diana wanted to know, as soon as they were out on the road. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had not dared to ask the question before. <div class="bookquote">``I am not coming back to school any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne. Diana gasped and stared at Anne to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) meant it. '' Will Marilla let you stay home? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'ll have to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I'll never go to school to that man again.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, Anne! '' Diana looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) were ready to cry. <div class="bookquote">``I do think you're mean. What shall I do? Mr. Phillips will make me sit with that horrid Gertie Pye--I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) will because she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is sitting alone. Do come back, Anne.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'd do almost anything in the world for you, Diana,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne sadly. <div class="bookquote">``I'd let myself be torn limb from limb if it would do you any good. But I can't do this, so please don't ask it. You harrow up my very soul.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just think of all the fun you will miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>mourned Diana. <div class="bookquote">``We are going to build the loveliest new house down by the brook; and we'll be playing ball next week and you've never played ball, Anne. It's tremendously exciting. And we're going to learn a new song-- Jane Andrews is practicing it up now; and Alice Andrews is going to bring a new Pansy book next week and we're all going to read it out loud, chapter about, down by the brook. And you know you are so fond of reading out loud, Anne.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Nothing moved Anne in the least. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mind was made up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would not go to school to Mr. Phillips again; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) told Marilla so when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) got home. '' Nonsense,'' said Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``It isn't nonsense at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne, gazing at Marilla with solemn, reproachful eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you understand, Marilla? I've been insulted.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Insulted fiddlesticks! You'll go to school tomorrow as usual.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head gently. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not going back, Marilla. I'll learn my lessons at home and I'll be as good as I can be and hold my tongue all the time if it's possible at all. But I will not go back to school, I assure you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla saw something remarkably like unyielding stubbornness looking out of Anne's small face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) understood that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would have trouble in overcoming it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) re-solved wisely to say nothing more just then. <div class="bookquote">``I'll run down and see Rachel about it this evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``There's no use reasoning with Anne now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'s too worked up and I've an idea she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) can be awful stubborn if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) takes the notion. Far as I can make out from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) story, Mr. Phillips has been carrying matters with a rather high hand. But it would never do to say so to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). I'll just talk it over with Rachel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>)'s sent ten children to school and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) ought to know something about it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>)'ll have heard the whole story, too, by this time. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla found Mrs. Lynde knitting quilts as industriously and cheerfully as usual. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you know what I've come about,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) said, a little shamefacedly. Mrs. Rachel nodded. '' About Anne's fuss in school, I reckon,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tillie Boulter was in on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) way home from school and told me about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) declares she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) won't go back to school. I never saw a child so worked up. I've been expecting trouble ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) started to school. I knew things were going too smooth to last. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s so high strung. What would you advise, Rachel?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, since you've asked my advice, Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lynde/Mrs. Rachel/Rachel</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Lynde amiably-- Mrs. Lynde dearly loved to be asked for advice--<div class="bookquote">``I'd just humor her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) a little at first, that's what I'd do. It's my belief that Mr. Phillips was in the wrong. Of course, it doesn't do to say so to the children, you know. And of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) did right to punish her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) yesterday for giving way to temper. But today it was different. The others who were late should have been punished as well as Anne, that's what. And I don't believe in making the girls sit with the boys for punishment. It isn't modest. Tillie Boulter was real indignant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) took Anne's part right through and said all the scholars did too. Anne seems real popular among them, somehow. I never thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'d take with them so well.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lynde/Mrs. Rachel/Rachel</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then you really think I'd better let her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) stay home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla in amazement. '' Yes. That is I wouldn't say school to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) again until she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) said it herself. Depend upon it, Marilla, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'ll cool off in a week or so and be ready enough to go back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) own accord , that's what, while, if you were to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) go back right off, dear knows what freak or tantrum she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'d take next and make more trouble than ever. The less fuss made the better, in my opinion.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) won't miss much by not going to school, as far as that goes. Mr. Phillips isn't any good at all as a teacher. The order he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) keeps is scandalous, that's what, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) neglects the young fry and puts all his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) time on those big scholars he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>)'s getting ready for Queen's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>)'d never have got the school for another year if his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) uncle hadn't been a trustee-- the trustee, for he (<font color='blue'><b>trustee</b></font>) just leads the other two around by the nose , that's what. I declare, I don't know what education in this Island is coming to.'' Mrs. Rachel shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) head, as much as to say if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) were only at the head of the educational system of the Province things would be much better managed. Marilla took Mrs. Rachel's advice and not another word was said to Anne about going back to school. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) learned her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lessons at home, did her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) chores, and played with Diana in the chilly purple autumn twilights; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) met Gilbert Blythe on the road or encountered him (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) in Sunday school she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) by with an icy contempt that was no whit thawed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) evident desire to appease her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Even Diana's efforts as a peacemaker were of no avail. Anne had evidently made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mind to hate Gilbert Blythe to the end of life. As much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hated Gilbert, however, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) love Diana, with all the love of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) passionate little heart, equally intense in its likes and dislikes. One evening Marilla, coming in from the orchard with a basket of apples, found Anne sitting along by the east window in the twilight, crying bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever's the matter now, Anne?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``It's about Diana,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>sobbed Anne luxuriously. <div class="bookquote">``I love Diana so, Marilla.
<p/>I cannot ever live without her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>). But I know very well when we grow up that Diana will get married and go away and leave me. And oh, what shall I do? I hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) husband--I just hate him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) furiously. I've been imagining it all out--the wedding and everything--Diana dressed in snowy garments, with a veil, and looking as beautiful and regal as a queen; and me the bridesmaid, with a lovely dress too, and puffed sleeves, but with a breaking heart hid beneath my smiling face. And then bidding Diana goodbye-e-e--''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Here Anne broke down entirely and wept with increasing bitterness. Marilla turned quickly away to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) twitching face; but it was no use; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) collapsed on the nearest chair and burst into such a hearty and unusual peal of laughter that Matthew, crossing the yard outside, halted in amazement. When had he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) heard Marilla laugh like that before? '' Well, Anne Shirley,'' said Marilla as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) could speak, <div class="bookquote">``if you must borrow trouble, for pity's sake borrow it handier home. I should think you had an imagination, sure enough.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XVI. Diana Is Invited to Tea with Tragic Results |OCTOBER was a beautiful month at Green Gables, when the birches in the hollow turned as golden as sunshine and the maples behind the orchard were royal crimson and the wild cherry trees along the lane put on the loveliest shades of dark red and bronzy green, while the fields sunned themselves in aftermaths. Anne reveled in the world of color about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). '' Oh, Marilla,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) exclaimed one Saturday morning, coming dancing in with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) arms full of gorgeous boughs, <div class="bookquote">``I'm so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers.
<p/>It would be terrible if we just skipped from September to November, wouldn't it? Look at these maple branches. Don't they give you a thrill--several thrills? I'm going to decorate my room with them.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Messy things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, whose aesthetic sense was not noticeably developed. '' You clutter up your room entirely too much with out-of-doors stuff, Anne. Bedrooms were made to sleep in.'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, and dream in too, Marilla. And you know one can dream so much better in a room where there are pretty things. I'm going to put these boughs in the old blue jug and set them on my table.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mind you don't drop leaves all over the stairs then. I'm going on a meeting of the Aid Society at Carmody this afternoon, Anne, and I won't likely be home before dark. You'll have to get Matthew and Jerry their supper, so mind you don't forget to put the tea to draw until you sit down at the table as you did last time.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was dreadful of me to forget,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne apologetically, <div class="bookquote">``but that was the afternoon I was trying to think of a name for Violet Vale and it crowded other things out. Matthew was so good. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) never scolded a bit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) put the tea down himself and said we could wait awhile as well as not. And I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) a lovely fairy story while we were waiting, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) didn't find the time long at all. It was a beautiful fairy story, Marilla. I forgot the end of it, so I made up an end for it myself and Matthew said he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) couldn't tell where the join came in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Matthew would think it all right, Anne, if you took a notion to get up and have dinner in the middle of the night. But you keep your wits about you this time. And--I don't really know if I'm doing right --it may make you more addlepated than ever--but you can ask Diana to come over and spend the afternoon with you and have tea here.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Marilla!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands. '' How perfectly lovely! You are able to imagine things after all or else you'd never have understood how I've longed for that very thing. It will seem so nice and grown-uppish. No fear of my forgetting to put the tea to draw when I have company. Oh, Marilla, can I use the rosebud spray tea set?'' <div class="bookquote">``No, indeed! The rosebud tea set! Well, what next? You know I never use that except for the minister or the Aids. You'll put down the old brown tea set. But you can open the little yellow crock of cherry preserves. It's time it was being used anyhow-- I believe it's beginning to work. And you can cut some fruit cake and have some of the cookies and snaps.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can just imagine myself sitting down at the head of the table and pouring out the tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne, shutting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes ecstatically. '' And asking Diana if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) takes sugar! I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) doesn't but of course I'll ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) just as if I didn't know. And then pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to take another piece of fruit cake and another helping of preserves. Oh, Marilla, it's a wonderful sensation just to think of it. Can I take her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) into the spare room to lay off her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) hat when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) comes? And then into the parlor to sit?'' <div class="bookquote">``No.
<p/>The sitting room will do for you and your company. But there's a bottle half full of raspberry cordial that was left over from the church social the other night. It's on the second shelf of the sitting-room closet and you and Diana can have it if you like, and a cooky to eat with it along in the afternoon, for I daresay Matthew 'll be late coming in to tea since he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)'s hauling potatoes to the vessel.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne flew down to the hollow, past the Dryad's Bubble and up the spruce path to Orchard Slope, to ask Diana to tea. As a result just after Marilla had driven off to Carmody, Diana came over, dressed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) second-best dress and looking exactly as it is proper to look when asked out to tea. At other times she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) was wont to run into the kitchen without knocking; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) knocked primly at the front door. And when Anne, dressed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) second best, as primly opened it, both little girls shook hands as gravely as if they had never met before. This unnatural solemnity lasted until after Diana had been taken to the east gable to lay off her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) hat and then had sat for ten minutes in the sitting room, toes in position. <div class="bookquote">``How is your mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>inquired Anne politely, just as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had not seen Mrs. Barry picking apples that morning in excellent health and spirits. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) is very well, thank you. I suppose Mr. Cuthbert is hauling potatoes to the lily sands this afternoon, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana, who had ridden down to Mr. Harmon Andrews's that morning in Matthew's cart. '' Yes. Our potato crop is very good this year. I hope your father's crop is good too.'' <div class="bookquote">``It is fairly good, thank you.
<p/>Have you picked many of your apples yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, ever so many,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne forgetting to be dignified and jumping up quickly. '' Let's go out to the orchard and get some of the Red Sweetings, Diana. Marilla says we can have all that are left on the tree. Marilla is a very generous woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) said we could have fruit cake and cherry preserves for tea. But it isn't good manners to tell your company what you are going to give them to eat, so I won't tell you what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) said we could have to drink. Only it begins with an R and a C and it's bright red color. I love bright red drinks, don't you? They taste twice as good as any other color. '' The orchard, with its great sweeping boughs that bent to the ground with fruit, proved so delightful that the little girls spent most of the afternoon in it, sitting in a grassy corner where the frost had spared the green and the mellow autumn sunshine lingered warmly, eating apples and talking as hard as they could. Diana had much to tell Anne of what went on in school. She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) had to sit with Gertie Pye and she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) hated it; Gertie squeaked her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) pencil all the time and it just made her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>)--Diana's--blood run cold; Ruby Gillis had charmed all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) warts away, true's you live, with a magic pebble that old Mary Joe from the Creek gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>). You had to rub the warts with the pebble and then throw it away over your left shoulder at the time of the new moon and the warts would all go.
<p/>Charlie Sloane's name was written up with Em White's on the porch wall and Em White was awful mad about it; Sam Boulter had <div class="bookquote">``sassed''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>Mr. Phillips in class and Mr. Phillips whipped him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) and Sam's father came down to the school and dared Mr. Phillips to lay a hand on one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) children again; and Mattie Andrews had a new red hood and a blue crossover with tassels on it and the airs she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) put on about it were perfectly sickening; and Lizzie Wright didn't speak to Mamie Wilson because Mamie Wilson's grown-up sister had cut out Lizzie Wright's grown-up sister with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) beau; and everybody missed Anne so and wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'s come to school again; and Gilbert Blythe-- But Anne didn't want to hear about Gilbert Blythe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) jumped up hurriedly and said suppose they go in and have some raspberry cordial. Anne looked on the second shelf of the room pantry but there was no bottle of raspberry cordial there. Search revealed it away back on the top shelf. Anne put it on a tray and set it on the table with a tumbler. <div class="bookquote">``Now, please help yourself, Diana,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) said politely. <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe I'll have any just now. I don't feel as if I wanted any after all those apples. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>Diana poured herself out a tumblerful, looked at its bright-red hue admiringly, and then sipped it daintily. <div class="bookquote">``That's awfully nice raspberry cordial, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't know raspberry cordial was so nice.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm real glad you like it. Take as much as you want. I'm going to run out and stir the fire up. There are so many responsibilities on a person's mind when they're keeping house, isn't there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><p/>When Anne came back from the kitchen Diana was drinking her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) second glassful of cordial; and, being entreated thereto by Anne, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) offered no particular objection to the drinking of a third. The tumblerfuls were generous ones and the raspberry cordial was certainly very nice. <div class="bookquote">``The nicest I ever drank,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana. <div class="bookquote">``It's ever so much nicer than Mrs. Lynde's, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) brags of hers so much. It doesn't taste a bit like hers.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I should think Marilla's raspberry cordial would prob`ly be much nicer than Mrs. Lynde's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne loyally. <div class="bookquote">``Marilla is a famous cook. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is trying to teach me to cook but I assure you, Diana, it is uphill work. There's so little scope for imagination in cookery. You just have to go by rules. The last time I made a cake I forgot to put the flour in. I was thinking the loveliest story about you and me, Diana. I thought you were desperately ill with smallpox and everybody deserted you, but I went boldly to your bedside and nursed you back to life; and then I took the smallpox and died and I was buried under those poplar trees in the graveyard and you planted a rosebush by my grave and watered it with your tears; and you never, never forgot the friend of your youth who sacrificed her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) life for you. Oh, it was such a pathetic tale, Diana. The tears just rained down over my cheeks while I mixed the cake. But I forgot the flour and the cake was a dismal failure. Flour is so essential to cakes, you know. Marilla was very cross and I don't wonder. I'm a great trial to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) was terribly mortified about the pudding sauce last week.
<p/>We had a plum pudding for dinner on Tuesday and there was half the pudding and a pitcherful of sauce left over. Marilla said there was enough for another dinner and told me to set it on the pantry shelf and cover it. I meant to cover it just as much as could be, Diana, but when I carried it in I was imagining I was a nun-- of course I'm a Protestant but I imagined I was a Catholic--taking the veil to bury a broken heart in cloistered seclusion; and I forgot all about covering the pudding sauce. I thought of it next morning and ran to the pantry. Diana, fancy if you can my extreme horror at finding a mouse drowned in that pudding sauce! I lifted the mouse out with a spoon and threw it out in the yard and then I washed the spoon in three waters. Marilla was out milking and I fully intended to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) came in if I'd give the sauce to the pigs; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) did come in I was imagining that I was a frost fairy going through the woods turning the trees red and yellow, whichever they wanted to be , so I never thought about the pudding sauce again and Marilla sent me out to pick apples. Well, Mr. and Mrs. Chester Ross from Spencervale came here that morning. You know they are very stylish people, especially Mrs. Chester Ross. When Marilla called me in dinner was all ready and everybody was at the table. I tried to be as polite and dignified as I could be, for I wanted Mrs. Chester Ross to think I was a ladylike little girl even if I wasn't pretty.
<p/>Everything went right until I saw Marilla coming with the plum pudding in one hand and the pitcher of pudding sauce warmed up , in the other. Diana, that was a terrible moment. I remembered everything and I just stood up in my place and shrieked out `Marilla, you mustn't use that pudding sauce. There was a mouse drowned in it. I forgot to tell you before.' Oh, Diana, I shall never forget that awful moment if I live to be a hundred. Mrs. Chester Ross just looked at me and I thought I would sink through the floor with mortification. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) is such a perfect housekeeper and fancy what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) must have thought of us. Marilla turned red as fire but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) never said a word--then. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) just carried that sauce and pudding out and brought in some strawberry preserves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) even offered me some, but I couldn't swallow a mouthful. It was like heaping coals of fire on my head. After Mrs. Chester Ross went away, Marilla gave me a dreadful scolding. Why, Diana, what is the matter? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>Diana had stood up very unsteadily; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) sat down again, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) head. '' I'm--I'm awful sick,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) said, a little thickly. <div class="bookquote">``I--I--must go right home.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you mustn't dream of going home without your tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>cried Anne in distress. <div class="bookquote">``I'll get it right off-- I'll go and put the tea down this very minute.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I must go home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>repeated Diana, stupidly but determinedly. '' Let me get you a lunch anyhow,'' implored Anne. <div class="bookquote">``Let me give you a bit of fruit cake and some of the cherry preserves. Lie down on the sofa for a little while and you'll be better. Where do you feel bad?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana, and that was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) would say. In vain Anne pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``I never heard of company going home without tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mourned. '' Oh, Diana, do you suppose that it's possible you're really taking the smallpox? If you are I'll go and nurse you, you can depend on that. I'll never forsake you. But I do wish you'd stay till after tea. Where do you feel bad?'' <div class="bookquote">``I'm awful dizzy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana. And indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) walked very dizzily. Anne, with tears of disappointment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes, got Diana's hat and went with her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) as far as the Barry yard fence. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) wept all the way back to Green Gables, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) sorrowfully put the remainder of the raspberry cordial back into the pantry and got tea ready for Matthew and Jerry, with all the zest gone out of the performance. The next day was Sunday and as the rain poured down in torrents from dawn till dusk Anne did not stir abroad from Green Gables. Monday afternoon Marilla sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) down to Mrs. Lynde's on an errand. In a very short space of time Anne came flying back up the lane with tears rolling down her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cheeks. Into the kitchen she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) dashed and flung herself face downward on the sofa in an agony. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever has gone wrong now, Anne?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>queried Marilla in doubt and dismay. <div class="bookquote">``I do hope you haven't gone and been saucy to Mrs. Lynde again.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>No answer from Anne save more tears and stormier sobs! '' Anne Shirley, when I ask you a question I want to be answered. Sit right up this very minute and tell me what you are crying about.'' Anne sat up, tragedy personified. ''
<p/>Mrs. Lynde was up to see Mrs. Barry today and Mrs. Barry was in an awful state,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) wailed. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) says that I set Diana drunk Saturday and sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) home in a disgraceful condition. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) says I must be a thoroughly bad, wicked little girl and she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>)'s never, never going to let Diana play with me again. Oh, Marilla, I'm just overcome with woe. '' Marilla stared in blank amazement. <div class="bookquote">``Set Diana drunk!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) said when she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) voice. '' Anne are you or Mrs. Barry crazy? What on earth did you give her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``Not a thing but raspberry cordial,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>sobbed Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I never thought raspberry cordial would set people drunk, Marilla-- not even if they drank three big tumblerfuls as Diana did. Oh, it sounds so-- so--like Mrs. Thomas's husband! But I didn't mean to set her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) drunk.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Drunk fiddlesticks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, marching to the sitting room pantry. There on the shelf was a bottle which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) at once recognized as one containing some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) three-year-old homemade currant wine for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) was celebrated in Avonlea, although certain of the stricter sort, Mrs. Barry among them, disapproved strongly of it. And at the same time Marilla recollected that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had put the bottle of raspberry cordial down in the cellar instead of in the pantry as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had told Anne. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went back to the kitchen with the wine bottle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face was twitching in spite of herself. <div class="bookquote">``Anne, you certainly have a genius for getting into trouble. You went and gave Diana currant wine instead of raspberry cordial. Didn't you know the difference yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I never tasted it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I thought it was the cordial.

Her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) mother smelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) breath and knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) was drunk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) had a fearful headache all day yesterday. Mrs. Barry is so indignant.

Mrs. Barry will think better of it when she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) finds you're not to blame. I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) thinks you've done it for a silly joke or something of that sort. You'd best go up this evening and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) how it was.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My courage fails me at the thought of facing Diana's injured mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>sighed Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd go, Marilla. You're so much more dignified than I am. Likely she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'d listen to you quicker than to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, reflecting that it would probably be the wiser course. <div class="bookquote">``Don't cry any more, Anne. It will be all right. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) mind about it being all right by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) got back from Orchard Slope. Anne was watching for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) coming and flew to the porch door to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). '' Oh, Marilla, I know by your face that it's been no use,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) said sorrowfully. '' Mrs. Barry won't forgive me?'' <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Barry indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>snapped Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``Of all the unreasonable women I ever saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s the worst. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) it was all a mistake and you weren't to blame, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) just simply didn't believe me. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) rubbed it well in about my currant wine and how I'd always said it couldn't have the least effect on anybody. I just told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) plainly that currant wine wasn't meant to be drunk three tumblerfuls at a time and that if a child I had to do with was so greedy I'd sober her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) up with a right good spanking. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla whisked into the kitchen, grievously disturbed, leaving a very much distracted little soul in the porch behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>). Presently Anne stepped out bareheaded into the chill autumn dusk; very determinedly and steadily she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) way down through the sere clover field over the log bridge and up through the spruce grove, lighted by a pale little moon hanging low over the western woods. Mrs. Barry, coming to the door in answer to a timid knock, found a white-lipped eager-eyed suppliant on the doorstep. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) face hardened. Mrs. Barry was a woman of strong prejudices and dislikes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) anger was of the cold, sullen sort which is always hardest to overcome.
<p/>To do her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) justice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) really believed Anne had made Diana drunk out of sheer malice prepense, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was honestly anxious to preserve her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) little daughter from the contamination of further intimacy with such a child. <div class="bookquote">``What do you want?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said stiffly. Anne clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands. '' Oh, Mrs. Barry, please forgive me. I did not mean to--to--intoxicate Diana. How could I? Just imagine if you were a poor little orphan girl that kind people had adopted and you had just one bosom friend in all the world. Do you think you would intoxicate her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) on purpose? I thought it was only raspberry cordial. I was firmly convinced it was raspberry cordial. Oh, please don't say that you won't let Diana play with me any more. If you do you will cover my life with a dark cloud of woe.'' This speech which would have softened good Mrs. Lynde's heart in a twinkling, had no effect on Mrs. Barry except to irritate her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) still more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) was suspicious of Anne's big words and dramatic gestures and imagined that the child was making fun of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). So she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, coldly and cruelly: <div class="bookquote">``I don't think you are a fit little girl for Diana to associate with. You'd better go home and behave yourself. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Anne's lips quivered. '' Won't you let me see Diana just once to say farewell? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) implored. <div class="bookquote">``Diana has gone over to Carmody with her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barry</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Barry, going in and shutting the door. Anne went back to Green Gables calm with despair. <div class="bookquote">``My last hope is gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) told Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``I went up and saw Mrs. Barry myself and she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) treated me very insultingly. Marilla, I do not think she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) is a well-bred woman.
<p/>There is nothing more to do except to pray and I haven't much hope that that'll do much good because, Marilla, I do not believe that God Himself can do very much with such an obstinate person as Mrs. Barry.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Anne, you shouldn't say such things''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>rebuked Marilla, striving to overcome that unholy tendency to laughter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was dismayed to find growing upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). And indeed, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) told the whole story to Matthew that night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did laugh heartily over Anne's tribulations. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) slipped into the east gable before going to bed and found that Anne had cried herself to sleep an unaccustomed softness crept into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Poor little soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) murmured, lifting a loose curl of hair from the child's tear-stained face. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) bent down and kissed the flushed cheek on the pillow. CHAPTER XVII. A New Interest in Life |THE next afternoon Anne, bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) patchwork at the kitchen window, happened to glance out and beheld Diana down by the Dryad's Bubble beckoning mysteriously. In a trice Anne was out of the house and flying down to the hollow, astonishment and hope struggling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) expressive eyes. But the hope faded when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw Diana's dejected countenance. <div class="bookquote">``Your mother hasn't relented? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) gasped. Diana shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) head mournfully. '' No; and oh, Anne, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) says I'm never to play with you again. I've cried and cried and I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) it wasn't your fault, but it wasn't any use. I had ever such a time coaxing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to let me come down and say good-bye to you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said I was only to stay ten minutes and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'s timing me by the clock.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ten minutes isn't very long to say an eternal farewell in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne tearfully. ''
<p/>Oh, Diana, will you promise faithfully never to forget me, the friend of your youth, no matter what dearer friends may caress thee?'' <div class="bookquote">``Indeed I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>sobbed Diana, <div class="bookquote">``and I'll never have another bosom friend--I don't want to have. I couldn't love anybody as I love you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Diana,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>cried Anne, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands, <div class="bookquote">``do you love me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, of course I do. Didn't you know that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne drew a long breath. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you liked me of course but I never hoped you loved me. Why, Diana, I didn't think anybody could love me. Nobody ever has loved me since I can remember. Oh, this is wonderful! It's a ray of light which will forever shine on the darkness of a path severed from thee, Diana. Oh, just say it once again.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I love you devotedly, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana stanchly, <div class="bookquote">``and I always will, you may be sure of that.''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And I will always love thee, Diana,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne, solemnly extending her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand. '' In the years to come thy memory will shine like a star over my lonely life, as that last story we read together says. Diana, wilt thou give me a lock of thy jet-black tresses in parting to treasure forevermore?'' <div class="bookquote">``Have you got anything to cut it with?''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>queried Diana, wiping away the tears which Anne's affecting accents had caused to flow afresh, and returning to practicalities. '' Yes. I've got my patchwork scissors in my apron pocket fortunately,'' said Anne. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) solemnly clipped one of Diana's curls. '' Fare thee well, my beloved friend. Henceforth we must be as strangers though living side by side. But my heart will ever be faithful to thee.''
<p/>Anne stood and watched Diana out of sight, mournfully waving her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) hand to the latter whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) turned to look back. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) returned to the house, not a little consoled for the time being by this romantic parting. <div class="bookquote">``It is all over,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) informed Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``I shall never have another friend. I'm really worse off than ever before, for I haven't Katie Maurice and Violetta now. And even if I had it wouldn't be the same. Somehow, little dream girls are not satisfying after a real friend. Diana and I had such an affecting farewell down by the spring. It will be sacred in my memory forever. I used the most pathetic language I could think of and said `thou' and `thee.' ' Thou' and `thee' seem so much more romantic than `you.' Diana gave me a lock of her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) hair and I'm going to sew it up in a little bag and wear it around my neck all my life. Please see that it is buried with me, for I don't believe I'll live very long. Perhaps when she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) sees me lying cold and dead before her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) Mrs. Barry may feel remorse for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) has done and will let Diana come to my funeral.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't think there is much fear of your dying of grief as long as you can talk, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla unsympathetically. The following Monday Anne surprised Marilla by coming down from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) room with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) basket of books on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) arm and hip and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lips primmed up into a line of determination. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going back to school,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) announced. <div class="bookquote">``That is all there is left in life for me, now that my friend has been ruthlessly torn from me. In school I can look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and muse over days departed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better muse over your lessons and sums,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, concealing her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) delight at this development of the situation. <div class="bookquote">``If you're going back to school I hope we'll hear no more of breaking slates over people's heads and such carryings on. Behave yourself and do just what your teacher tells you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll try to be a model pupil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>agreed Anne dolefully. <div class="bookquote">``There won't be much fun in it, I expect. Mr. Phillips said Minnie Andrews was a model pupil and there isn't a spark of imagination or life in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is just dull and poky and never seems to have a good time. But I feel so depressed that perhaps it will come easy to me now. I'm going round by the road. I couldn't bear to go by the Birch Path all alone. I should weep bitter tears if I did. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne was welcomed back to school with open arms. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) imagination had been sorely missed in games, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) voice in the singing and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) dramatic ability in the perusal aloud of books at dinner hour. Ruby Gillis smuggled three blue plums over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) during testament reading; Ella May MacPherson gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) an enormous yellow pansy cut from the covers of a floral catalogue--a species of desk decoration much prized in Avonlea school. Sophia Sloane offered to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) a perfectly elegant new pattern of knit lace, so nice for trimming aprons. Katie Boulter gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>) a perfume bottle to keep slate water in, and Julia Bell copied carefully on a piece of pale pink paper scalloped on the edges the following effusion: When twilight drops her (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>) curtain down And pins it with a star Remember that you have a friend Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>) may wander far.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's so nice to be appreciated,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>sighed Anne rapturously to Marilla that night. The girls were not the only scholars who <div class="bookquote">``appreciated''  (<font color='red'><b>girls the scholars</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>). When Anne went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) seat after dinner hour--she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been told by Mr. Phillips to sit with the model Minnie Andrews--she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) desk a big luscious <div class="bookquote">``strawberry apple. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Anne caught it up all ready to take a bite when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) remembered that the only place in Avonlea where strawberry apples grew was in the old Blythe orchard on the other side of the Lake of Shining Waters. Anne dropped the apple as if it were a red-hot coal and ostentatiously wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) fingers on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) handkerchief. The apple lay untouched on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) desk until the next morning, when little Timothy Andrews, who swept the school and kindled the fire, annexed it as one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) perquisites. Charlie Sloane's slate pencil, gorgeously bedizened with striped red and yellow paper, costing two cents where ordinary pencils cost only one, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) sent up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) after dinner hour, met with a more favorable reception. Anne was graciously pleased to accept it and rewarded the donor with a smile which exalted that infatuated youth straightway into the seventh heaven of delight and caused him (<font color='blue'><b>donor</b></font>) to make such fearful errors in his (<font color='blue'><b>donor</b></font>) dictation that Mr. Phillips kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) in after school to rewrite it. But as, The Caesar's pageant shorn of Brutus' bust Did but of Rome's best son remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) more, so the marked absence of any tribute or recognition from Diana Barry who was sitting with Gertie Pye embittered Anne's little triumph. <div class="bookquote">``Diana might just have smiled at me once, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) mourned to Marilla that night.
<p/>But the next morning a note most fearfully and wonderfully twisted and folded, and a small parcel were passed across to Anne. Dear Anne -LRB-ran the former-RRB- Mother says I'm not to play with you or talk to you even in school. It isn't my fault and don't be cross at me, because I love you as much as ever. I miss you awfully to tell all my secrets to and I don't like Gertie Pye one bit. I made you one of the new bookmarkers out of red tissue paper. They are awfully fashionable now and only three girls in school know how to make them. When you look at it remember Your true friend Diana Barry. Anne read the note, kissed the bookmark, and dispatched a prompt reply back to the other side of the school. My own darling Diana:-- Of course I am not cross at you because you have to obey your mother. Our spirits can commune. I shall keep your lovely present forever. Minnie Andrews is a very nice little girl--although she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has no imagination--but after having been Diana's busum friend I cannot be Minnie's. Please excuse mistakes because my spelling isn't very good yet, although much improoved. Yours until death us do part Anne or Cordelia Shirley. P.S. I shall sleep with your letter under my pillow tonight. A. or C.S. Marilla pessimistically expected more trouble since Anne had again begun to go to school. But none developed. Perhaps Anne caught something of the <div class="bookquote">``model''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>spirit from Minnie Andrews; at least she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) got on very well with Mr. Phillips thenceforth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) flung herself into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) studies heart and soul, determined not to be outdone in any class by Gilbert Blythe.
<p/>The rivalry between them was soon apparent; it was entirely good natured on Gilbert's side; but it is much to be feared that the same thing cannot be said of Anne, who had certainly an unpraiseworthy tenacity for holding grudges. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was as intense in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hatreds as in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) loves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would not stoop to admit that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) meant to rival Gilbert in schoolwork, because that would have been to acknowledge his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) existence which Anne persistently ignored; but the rivalry was there and honors fluctuated between them. Now Gilbert was head of the spelling class; now Anne, with a toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) long red braids, spelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) down. One morning Gilbert had all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) sums done correctly and had his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) name written on the blackboard on the roll of honor; the next morning Anne, having wrestled wildly with decimals the entire evening before, would be first. One awful day they were ties and their names were written up together. It was almost as bad as a take-notice and Anne's mortification was as evident as Gilbert's satisfaction. When the written examinations at the end of each month were held the suspense was terrible. The first month Gilbert came out three marks ahead. The second Anne beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) by five. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) triumph was marred by the fact that Gilbert congratulated her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heartily before the whole school. It would have been ever so much sweeter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) had felt the sting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) defeat. Mr. Phillips might not be a very good teacher; but a pupil so inflexibly determined on learning as Anne was could hardly escape making progress under any kind of teacher.
<p/>By the end of the term Anne and Gilbert were both promoted into the fifth class and allowed to begin studying the elements of <div class="bookquote">``the branches'' (<font color='red'><b>Gilbert/Gilbert Blythe/Blythe</b></font>)</div>--by which Latin, geometry, French, and algebra were meant. In geometry Anne met her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) Waterloo. <div class="bookquote">``It's perfectly awful stuff, Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) groaned. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I'll never be able to make head or tail of it. There is no scope for imagination in it at all. Mr. Phillips says I'm the worst dunce he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) ever saw at it. And Gil--I mean some of the others are so smart at it. It is extremely mortifying, Marilla. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>Even Diana gets along better than I do. But I don't mind being beaten by Diana. Even although we meet as strangers now I still love her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) with an inextinguishable love. It makes me very sad at times to think about her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>). But really, Marilla, one can't stay sad very long in such an interesting world, can one?'' CHAPTER XVIII. Anne to the Rescue |ALL things great are wound up with all things little. At first glance it might not seem that the decision of a certain Canadian Premier to include Prince Edward Island in a political tour could have much or anything to do with the fortunes of little Anne Shirley at Green Gables. But it had. It was a January the Premier came, to address his (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) loyal supporters and such of his (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) nonsupporters as chose to be present at the monster mass meeting held in Charlottetown. Most of the Avonlea people were on Premier's side of politics; hence on the night of the meeting nearly all the men and a goodly proportion of the women had gone to town thirty miles away. Mrs. Rachel Lynde had gone too.
<p/>Mrs. Rachel Lynde was a red-hot politician and couldn't have believed that the political rally could be carried through without her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>), although she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) was on the opposite side of politics. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) went to town and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) husband--Thomas would be useful in looking after the horse--and Marilla Cuthbert with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>). Marilla had a sneaking interest in politics herself, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) thought it might be her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) only chance to see a real live Premier, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) promptly took it, leaving Anne and Matthew to keep house until her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) return the following day. Hence, while Marilla and Mrs. Rachel were enjoying themselves hugely at the mass meeting, Anne and Matthew had the cheerful kitchen at Green Gables all to themselves. A bright fire was glowing in the old-fashioned Waterloo stove and blue-white frost crystals were shining on the windowpanes. Matthew nodded over a Farmers' Advocate on the sofa and Anne at the table studied her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lessons with grim determination, despite sundry wistful glances at the clock shelf, where lay a new book that Jane Andrews had lent her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) that day. Jane had assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) that it was warranted to produce any number of thrills, or words to that effect, and Anne's fingers tingled to reach out for it. But that would mean Gilbert Blythe's triumph on the morrow. Anne turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) back on the clock shelf and tried to imagine it wasn't there. <div class="bookquote">``Matthew, did you ever study geometry when you went to school?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well now, no, I didn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew, coming out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) doze with a start. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you had,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>sighed Anne, <div class="bookquote">``because then you'd be able to sympathize with me. You can't sympathize properly if you've never studied it. It is casting a cloud over my whole life. I'm such a dunce at it, Matthew.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well now, I dunno,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew soothingly. <div class="bookquote">``I guess you're all right at anything. Mr. Phillips told me last week in Blair's store at Carmody that you was the smartest scholar in school and was making rapid progress. ' Rapid progress' was his (<font color='blue'><b>Carmody</b></font>) very words. There's them as runs down Teddy Phillips and says he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) ain't much of a teacher, but I guess he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>)'s all right. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>Matthew would have thought anyone who praised Anne was <div class="bookquote">``all right.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I'd get on better with geometry if only he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) wouldn't change the letters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>complained Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I learn the proposition off by heart and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) draws it on the blackboard and puts different letters from what are in the book and I get all mixed up. I don't think a teacher should take such a mean advantage, do you? We're studying agriculture now and I've found out at last what makes the roads red. It's a great comfort. I wonder how Marilla and Mrs. Lynde are enjoying themselves. Mrs. Lynde says Canada is going to the dogs the way things are being run at Ottawa and that it's an awful warning to the electors. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) says if women were allowed to vote we would soon see a blessed change. What way do you vote, Matthew?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Conservative,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew promptly. To vote Conservative was part of Matthew's religion. '' Then I'm Conservative too,'' said Anne decidedly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm glad because Gil--because some of the boys in school are Grits. I guess Mr. Phillips is a Grit too because Prissy Andrews's father is one, and Ruby Gillis says that when a man is courting he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always has to agree with the girl's mother in religion and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father in politics. Is that true, Matthew?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever go courting, Matthew?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well now, no, I dunno's I ever did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew, who had certainly never thought of such a thing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) whole existence. Anne reflected with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) chin in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``It must be rather interesting, don't you think, Matthew? Ruby Gillis says when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) grows up she (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>)'s going to have ever so many beaus on the string and have them all crazy about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>); but I think that would be too exciting. I'd rather have just one in his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) right mind. But Ruby Gillis knows a great deal about such matters because she (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) has so many big sisters, and Mrs. Lynde says the Gillis girls have gone off like hot cakes. Mr. Phillips goes up to see Prissy Andrews nearly every evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) says it is to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) lessons but Miranda Sloane is studying for Queen's too, and I should think she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) needed help a lot more than Prissy because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>)'s ever so much stupider, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Prissy</b></font>) never goes to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) in the evenings at all. There are a great many things in this world that I can't understand very well, Matthew.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well now, I dunno as I comprehend them all myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>acknowledged Matthew. '' Well, I suppose I must finish up my lessons. I won't allow myself to open that new book Jane lent me until I'm through. But it's a terrible temptation, Matthew. Even when I turn my back on it I can see it there just as plain. Jane said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) cried herself sick over it. I love a book that makes me cry. But I think I'll carry that book into the sitting room and lock it in the jam closet and give you the key.
<p/>And you must not give it to me, Matthew, until my lessons are done, not even if I implore you on my bended knees. It's all very well to say resist temptation, but it's ever so much easier to resist it if you can't get the key. And then shall I run down the cellar and get some russets, Matthew? Wouldn't you like some russets?'' <div class="bookquote">``Well now, I dunno but what I would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew, who never ate russets but knew Anne's weakness for them. Just as Anne emerged triumphantly from the cellar with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) plateful of russets came the sound of flying footsteps on the icy board walk outside and the next moment the kitchen door was flung open and in rushed Diana Barry, white faced and breathless, with a shawl wrapped hastily around her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) head. Anne promptly let go of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) candle and plate in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) surprise, and plate, candle, and apples crashed together down the cellar ladder and were found at the bottom embedded in melted grease, the next day, by Marilla, who gathered them up and thanked mercy the house hadn't been set on fire. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever is the matter, Diana?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>cried Anne. '' Has your mother relented at last?'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Anne, do come quick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>implored Diana nervously. '' Minnie May is awful sick--she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>)'s got croup. Young Mary Joe says--and Father and Mother are away to town and there's nobody to go for the doctor. Minnie May is awful bad and Young Mary Joe doesn't know what to do-- and oh, Anne, I'm so scared!'' Matthew, without a word, reached out for cap and coat, slipped past Diana and away into the darkness of the yard.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)'s gone to harness the sorrel mare to go to Carmody for the doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne, who was hurrying on hood and jacket. <div class="bookquote">``I know it as well as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmody</b></font>)'d said so. Matthew and I are such kindred spirits I can read his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) thoughts without words at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)'ll find the doctor at Carmody,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>sobbed Diana. <div class="bookquote">``I know that Dr. Blair went to town and I guess Dr. Spencer would go too. Young Mary Joe never saw anybody with croup and Mrs. Lynde is away. Oh, Anne!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't cry, Di,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne cheerily. <div class="bookquote">``I know exactly what to do for croup. You forget that Mrs. Hammond had twins three times. When you look after three pairs of twins you naturally get a lot of experience. They all had croup regularly. Just wait till I get the ipecac bottle--you mayn't have any at your house. Come on now.''  (<font color='red'><b>The girls</b></font>)</div>The two little girls hastened out hand in hand and hurried through Lover's Lane and across the crusted field beyond, for the snow was too deep to go by the shorter wood way. Anne, although sincerely sorry for Minnie May, was far from being insensible to the romance of the situation and to the sweetness of once more sharing that romance with a kindred spirit. The night was clear and frosty, all ebony of shadow and silver of snowy slope; big stars were shining over the silent fields; here and there the dark pointed firs stood up with snow powdering their branches and the wind whistling through them. Anne thought it was truly delightful to go skimming through all this mystery and loveliness with your bosom friend who had been so long estranged. Minnie May, aged three, was really very sick.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lay on the kitchen sofa feverish and restless, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hoarse breathing could be heard all over the house. Young Mary Joe, a buxom, broad-faced French girl from the creek, whom Mrs. Barry had engaged to stay with the children during her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) absence, was helpless and bewildered, quite incapable of thinking what to do, or doing it if she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) thought of it. Anne went to work with skill and promptness. '' Minnie May has croup all right; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'s pretty bad, but I've seen them worse. First we must have lots of hot water. I declare, Diana, there isn't more than a cupful in the kettle! There, I've filled it up, and, Mary Joe, you may put some wood in the stove. I don't want to hurt your feelings but it seems to me you might have thought of this before if you'd any imagination. Now, I'll undress Minnie May and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) to bed and you try to find some soft flannel cloths, Diana. I'm going to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) a dose of ipecac first of all.'' Minnie May did not take kindly to the ipecac but Anne had not brought up three pairs of twins for nothing. Down that ipecac went, not only once, but many times during the long, anxious night when the two little girls worked patiently over the suffering Minnie May, and Young Mary Joe, honestly anxious to do all she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could, kept up a roaring fire and heated more water than would have been needed for a hospital of croupy babies. It was three o'clock when Matthew came with a doctor, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had been obliged to go all the way to Spencervale for one. But the pressing need for assistance was past. Minnie May was much better and was sleeping soundly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was awfully near giving up in despair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>explained Anne. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) got worse and worse until she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was sicker than ever the Hammond twins were, even the last pair. I actually thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was going to choke to death. I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) every drop of ipecac in that bottle and when the last dose went down I said to myself--not to Diana or Young Mary Joe, because I didn't want to worry them any more than they were worried, but I had to say it to myself just to relieve my feelings--`This is the last lingering hope and I fear, tis a vain one.' But in about three minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) coughed up the phlegm and began to get better right away. You must just imagine my relief, doctor, because I can't express it in words. You know there are some things that cannot be expressed in words.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>nodded the doctor. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) looked at Anne as if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) were thinking some things about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) that couldn't be expressed in words. Later on, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) expressed them to Mr. and Mrs. Barry. <div class="bookquote">``That little redheaded girl they have over at Cuthbert's is as smart as they make 'em. I tell you she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) saved that baby's life, for it would have been too late by the time I got there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) seems to have a skill and presence of mind perfectly wonderful in a child of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) age. I never saw anything like the eyes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) was explaining the case to me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne had gone home in the wonderful, white-frosted winter morning, heavy eyed from loss of sleep, but still talking unweariedly to Matthew as they crossed the long white field and walked under the glittering fairy arch of the Lover's Lane maples. ''
<p/>Oh, Matthew, isn't it a wonderful morning? The world looks like something God had just imagined for His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own pleasure, doesn't it? Those trees look as if I could blow them away with a breath--pouf! I'm so glad I live in a world where there are white frosts, aren't you? And I'm so glad Mrs. Hammond had three pairs of twins after all. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) hadn't I mightn't have known what to do for Minnie May. I'm real sorry I was ever cross with Mrs. Hammond for having twins. But, oh, Matthew, I'm so sleepy. I can't go to school. I just know I couldn't keep my eyes open and I'd be so stupid. But I hate to stay home, for Gil--some of the others will get head of the class, and it's so hard to get up again--although of course the harder it is the more satisfaction you have when you do get up, haven't you?'' <div class="bookquote">``Well now, I guess you'll manage all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew, looking at Anne's white little face and the dark shadows under her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``You just go right to bed and have a good sleep. I'll do all the chores. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne accordingly went to bed and slept so long and soundly that it was well on in the white and rosy winter afternoon when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) awoke and descended to the kitchen where Marilla, who had arrived home in the meantime, was sitting knitting. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, did you see the Premier? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Anne at once. <div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) look like Marilla?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) never got to be Premier on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Premier</b></font>) looks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``Such a nose as that man had! But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can speak. I was proud of being a Conservative.
<p/>Rachel Lynde, of course, being a Liberal, had no use for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Your dinner is in the oven, Anne, and you can get yourself some blue plum preserve out of the pantry. I guess you're hungry. Matthew has been telling me about last night. I must say it was fortunate you knew what to do. I wouldn't have had any idea myself, for I never saw a case of croup. There now, never mind talking till you've had your dinner. I can tell by the look of you that you're just full up with speeches, but they'll keep. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla had something to tell Anne, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) did not tell it just then for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) knew if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) did Anne's consequent excitement would lift her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) clear out of the region of such material matters as appetite or dinner. Not until Anne had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saucer of blue plums did Marilla say: <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Barry was here this afternoon, Anne. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wanted to see you, but I wouldn't wake you up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) says you saved Minnie May's life, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is very sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) acted as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did in that affair of the currant wine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knows now you didn't mean to set Diana drunk, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) hopes you'll forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) and be good friends with Diana again. You're to go over this evening if you like for Diana can't stir outside the door on account of a bad cold she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) caught last night. Now, Anne Shirley, for pity's sake don't fly up into the air. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>The warning seemed not unnecessary, so uplifted and aerial was Anne's expression and attitude as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sprang to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) feet, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face irradiated with the flame of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) spirit. '' Oh, Marilla, can I go right now--without washing my dishes?
<p/>I'll wash them when I come back, but I cannot tie myself down to anything so unromantic as dishwashing at this thrilling moment.'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, run along,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla indulgently. '' Anne Shirley--are you crazy? Come back this instant and put something on you. I might as well call to the wind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s gone without a cap or wrap.

It'll be a mercy if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) doesn't catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) death of cold. '' Anne came dancing home in the purple winter twilight across the snowy places. Afar in the southwest was the great shimmering, pearl-like sparkle of an evening star in a sky that was pale golden and ethereal rose over gleaming white spaces and dark glens of spruce. The tinkles of sleigh bells among the snowy hills came like elfin chimes through the frosty air, but their music was not sweeter than the song in Anne's heart and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``You see before you a perfectly happy person, Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) announced. <div class="bookquote">``I'm perfectly happy--yes, in spite of my red hair. Just at present I have a soul above red hair. Mrs. Barry kissed me and cried and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) was so sorry and she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) could never repay me. I felt fearfully embarrassed, Marilla, but I just said as politely as I could, 'I have no hard feelings for you, Mrs. Barry. I assure you once for all that I did not mean to intoxicate Diana and henceforth I shall cover the past with the mantle of oblivion.' That was a pretty dignified way of speaking wasn't it, Marilla?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I felt that I was heaping coals of fire on Mrs. Barry's head. And Diana and I had a lovely afternoon.

Not a soul in Avonlea knows it but us, and we pledged a solemn vow never to reveal it to anyone else.

And we had fruit cake and pound cake and doughnuts and two kinds of preserves, Marilla. And Mrs. Barry asked me if I took tea and said `Pa, why don't you pass the biscuits to Anne?' It must be lovely to be grown up, Marilla, when just being treated as if you were is so nice.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, with a brief sigh.

<p/>Diana left me to stir it while she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) buttered the plates and I forgot and let it burn; and then when we set it out on the platform to cool the cat walked over one plate and that had to be thrown away. But the making of it was splendid fun. Then when I came home Mrs. Barry asked me to come over as often as I could and Diana stood at the window and threw kisses to me all the way down to Lover's Lane.

Anne Shirley, you're dripping greasy water all over the floor. I never saw such a careless child.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I know I'm a great trial to you, Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne repentantly. <div class="bookquote">``I make so many mistakes.
<p/>But then just think of all the mistakes I don't make, although I might. I'll get some sand and scrub up the spots before I go to school. Oh, Marilla, my heart was just set on going to that concert. I never was to a concert in my life, and when the other girls talk about them in school I feel so out of it. You didn't know just how I felt about it, but you see Matthew did. Matthew understands me, and it's so nice to be understood, Marilla. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne was too excited to do herself justice as to lessons that morning in school. Gilbert Blythe spelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) down in class and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) clear out of sight in mental arithmetic. Anne's consequent humiliation was less than it might have been, however, in view of the concert and the spare-room bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and Diana talked so constantly about it all day that with a stricter teacher than Mr. Phillips dire disgrace must inevitably have been their portion. Anne felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not have borne it if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had not been going to the concert, for nothing else was discussed that day in school. The Avonlea Debating Club, which met fortnightly all winter, had had several smaller free entertainments; but this was to be a big affair, admission ten cents, in aid of the library. The Avonlea young people had been practicing for weeks, and all the scholars were especially interested in it by reason of older brothers and sisters who were going to take part. Everybody in school over nine years of age expected to go, except Carrie Sloane, whose father shared Marilla's opinions about small girls going out to night concerts.
<p/>Carrie Sloane cried into her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) grammar all the afternoon and felt that life was not worth living. For Anne the real excitement began with the dismissal of school and increased therefrom in crescendo until it reached to a crash of positive ecstasy in the concert itself. They had a <div class="bookquote">``perfectly elegant tea;''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>and then came the delicious occupation of dressing in Diana's little room upstairs. Diana did Anne's front hair in the new pompadour style and Anne tied Diana's bows with the especial knack she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) possessed; and they experimented with at least half a dozen different ways of arranging their back hair. At last they were ready, cheeks scarlet and eyes glowing with excitement. True, Anne could not help a little pang when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) contrasted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) plain black tam and shapeless, tight-sleeved, homemade gray-cloth coat with Diana's jaunty fur cap and smart little jacket. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) remembered in time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) had an imagination and could use it. Then Diana's cousins, the Murrays from Newbridge, came; they all crowded into the big pung sleigh, among straw and furry robes. Anne reveled in the drive to the hall, slipping along over the satin-smooth roads with the snow crisping under the runners. There was a magnificent sunset, and the snowy hills and deep-blue water of the St. Lawrence Gulf seemed to rim in the splendor like a huge bowl of pearl and sapphire brimmed with wine and fire. Tinkles of sleigh bells and distant laughter, that seemed like the mirth of wood elves, came from every quarter. '' Oh, Diana,'' breathed Anne, squeezing Diana's mittened hand under the fur robe, <div class="bookquote">``isn't it all like a beautiful dream? Do I really look the same as usual? I feel so different that it seems to me it must show in my looks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You look awfully nice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana, who having just received a compliment from one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) cousins, felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) ought to pass it on. <div class="bookquote">``You've got the loveliest color. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The program that night was a series of <div class="bookquote">``thrills''  (<font color='red'><b>listener</b></font>)</div>for at least one listener in the audience, and, as Anne assured Diana, every succeeding thrill was thrillier than the last. When Prissy Andrews, attired in a new pink-silk waist with a string of pearls about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) smooth white throat and real carnations in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hair--rumor whispered that the master had sent all the way to town for them for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``climbed the slimy ladder, dark without one ray of light,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>Anne shivered in luxurious sympathy; when the choir sang <div class="bookquote">``Far Above the Gentle Daisies''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne gazed at the ceiling as if it were frescoed with angels; when Sam Sloane proceeded to explain and illustrate <div class="bookquote">``How Sockery Set a Hen ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam Sloane</b></font>)</div>Anne laughed until people sitting near her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) laughed too, more out of sympathy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) than with amusement at a selection that was rather threadbare even in Avonlea; and when Mr. Phillips gave Mark Antony's oration over the dead body of Caesar in the most heart-stirring tones--looking at Prissy Andrews at the end of every sentence-- Anne felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could rise and mutiny on the spot if but one Roman citizen led the way. Only one number on the program failed to interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). When Gilbert Blythe recited <div class="bookquote">``Bingen on the Rhine''  (<font color='red'><b>Gilbert/Gilbert Blythe/Blythe</b></font>)</div>Anne picked up Rhoda Murray's library book and read it until he (<font color='blue'><b>Murray</b></font>) had finished, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sat rigidly stiff and motionless while Diana clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) hands until they tingled. It was eleven when they got home, sated with dissipation, but with the exceeding sweet pleasure of talking it all over still to come.
<p/>Everybody seemed asleep and the house was dark and silent. Anne and Diana tiptoed into the parlor, a long narrow room out of which the spare room opened. It was pleasantly warm and dimly lighted by the embers of a fire in the grate. '' Let's undress here,'' said Diana. <div class="bookquote">``It's so nice and warm.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hasn't it been a delightful time? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>sighed Anne rapturously. <div class="bookquote">``It must be splendid to get up and recite there. Do you suppose we will ever be asked to do it, Diana?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course, someday. They're always wanting the big scholars to recite. Gilbert Blythe does often and he (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>)'s only two years older than us. Oh, Anne, how could you pretend not to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>)? When he (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) came to the line, ' There's Another , not a sister ,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) looked right down at you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Diana,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne with dignity, <div class="bookquote">``you are my bosom friend, but I cannot allow even you to speak to me of that person. Are you ready for bed? Let's run a race and see who'll get to the bed first. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>The suggestion appealed to Diana. The two little white-clad figures flew down the long room, through the spare-room door, and bounded on the bed at the same moment. And then--something--moved beneath them , there was a gasp and a cry--and somebody said in muffled accents: '' Merciful goodness!'' Anne and Diana were never able to tell just how they got off that bed and out of the room. They only knew that after one frantic rush they found themselves tiptoeing shiveringly upstairs. '' Oh, who was it-- what was it?'' whispered Anne, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) teeth chattering with cold and fright. <div class="bookquote">``It was Aunt Josephine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana, gasping with laughter. ''
<p/>Oh, Anne, it was Aunt Josephine, however she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) came to be there. Oh, and I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) will be furious. It's dreadful--it's really dreadful--but did you ever know anything so funny, Anne?'' <div class="bookquote">``Who is your Aunt Josephine?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>)'s father's aunt and she (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) lives in Charlottetown. She (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>)'s awfully old--seventy anyhow--and I don't believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) was ever a little girl. We were expecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) out for a visit, but not so soon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>)'s awfully prim and proper and she (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>)'ll scold dreadfully about this, I know. Well, we'll have to sleep with Minnie May--and you can't think how she (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) kicks.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Barry/Josephine/Miss Josephine Barry</b></font>)</div>Miss Josephine Barry did not appear at the early breakfast the next morning. Mrs. Barry smiled kindly at the two little girls. '' Did you have a good time last night? I tried to stay awake until you came home, for I wanted to tell you Aunt Josephine had come and that you would have to go upstairs after all, but I was so tired I fell asleep. I hope you didn't disturb your aunt, Diana. '' Diana preserved a discreet silence, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) and Anne exchanged furtive smiles of guilty amusement across the table. Anne hurried home after breakfast and so remained in blissful ignorance of the disturbance which presently resulted in the Barry household until the late afternoon, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went down to Mrs. Lynde's on an errand for Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``So you and Diana nearly frightened poor old Miss Barry to death last night?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lynde/Mrs. Rachel/Rachel</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Lynde severely, but with a twinkle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) eye. '' Mrs. Barry was here a few minutes ago on her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) way to Carmody. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>)'s feeling real worried over it. Old Miss Barry was in a terrible temper when she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) got up this morning--and Josephine Barry's temper is no joke, I can tell you that.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) wouldn't speak to Diana at all.'' <div class="bookquote">``It wasn't Diana's fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne contritely. <div class="bookquote">``It was mine.

(<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lynde/Mrs. Rachel/Rachel</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Lynde, with the exultation of a correct guesser. <div class="bookquote">``I knew that idea came out of your head.

She (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>)'d have gone today if they could have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) had promised to pay for a quarter's music lessons for Diana, but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) is determined to do nothing at all for such a tomboy. Oh, I guess they had a lively time of it there this morning. The Barrys must feel cut up. Old Miss Barry is rich and they'd like to keep on the good side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>). Of course, Mrs. Barry didn't say just that to me, but I'm a pretty good judge of human nature , that's what.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm such an unlucky girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>mourned Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I'm always getting into scrapes myself and getting my best friends--people I'd shed my heart's blood for--into them too.

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lynde/Mrs. Rachel/Rachel</b></font>)</div><p/>No, Mrs. Lynde had not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) head sagely. <div class="bookquote">``You must learn to think a little, Anne, that's what.

(<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lynde/Mrs. Rachel/Rachel</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Lynde laughed comfortably over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) mild joke, but Anne remained pensive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw nothing to laugh at in the situation, which to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes appeared very serious. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) left Mrs. Lynde's she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) way across the crusted fields to Orchard Slope. Diana met her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) at the kitchen door. '' Your Aunt Josephine was very cross about it, wasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>)?'' whispered Anne. '' Yes,'' answered Diana, stifling a giggle with an apprehensive glance over her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) shoulder at the closed sitting-room door. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) was fairly dancing with rage, Anne. Oh, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) scolded.

(<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana with just scorn. <div class="bookquote">``I'm no telltale, Anne Shirley, and anyhow I was just as much to blame as you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm going in to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne resolutely.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>)'s in the room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana. <div class="bookquote">``You can go in if you want to.

<p/>And I don't believe you'll do a bit of good. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>With this encouragement Anne bearded the lion in its den--that is to say, walked resolutely up to the sitting-room door and knocked faintly. A sharp <div class="bookquote">``Come in''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Barry/Josephine/Miss Josephine Barry</b></font>)</div>followed. Miss Josephine Barry, thin, prim, and rigid, was knitting fiercely by the fire, her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) wrath quite unappeased and her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) eyes snapping through her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) gold-rimmed glasses. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) wheeled around in her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) chair, expecting to see Diana, and beheld a white-faced girl whose great eyes were brimmed up with a mixture of desperate courage and shrinking terror. <div class="bookquote">``Who are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Barry/Josephine/Miss Josephine Barry</b></font>)</div>demanded Miss Josephine Barry, without ceremony. <div class="bookquote">``I'm Anne of Green Gables,''  (<font color='red'><b>the visitor</b></font>)</div>said the small visitor tremulously, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) characteristic gesture, <div class="bookquote">``and I've come to confess, if you please.''  (<font color='red'><b>the visitor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Confess what?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That it was all my fault about jumping into bed on you last night. I suggested it.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I must, hey? I rather think Diana did her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) share of the jumping at least.

Diana's heart is set on her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) music lessons, Miss Barry, and I know too well what it is to set your heart on a thing and not get it. If you must be cross with anyone, be cross with me. I've been so used in my early days to having people cross at me that I can endure it much better than Diana can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Much of the snap had gone out of the old lady's eyes by this time and was replaced by a twinkle of amused interest. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) still said severely: <div class="bookquote">``I don't think it is any excuse for you that you were only in fun. Little girls never indulged in that kind of fun when I was young.

But then, there is our side of it too. Have you any imagination, Miss Barry? If you have, just put yourself in our place. We didn't know there was anybody in that bed and you nearly scared us to death. It was simply awful the way we felt. And then we couldn't sleep in the spare room after being promised. I suppose you are used to sleeping in spare rooms. But just imagine what you would feel like if you were a little orphan girl who had never had such an honor. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All the snap had gone by this time. Miss Barry actually laughed--a sound which caused Diana, waiting in speechless anxiety in the kitchen outside, to give a great gasp of relief. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid my imagination is a little rusty--it's so long since I used it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say your claim to sympathy is just as strong as mine.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry I can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne firmly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would like to, because you seem like an interesting lady, and you might even be a kindred spirit although you don't look very much like it.

She (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) is doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) best, but it is very discouraging work. You must not blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) because I jumped on the bed. But before I go I do wish you would tell me if you will forgive Diana and stay just as long as you meant to in Avonlea.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think perhaps I will if you will come over and talk to me occasionally,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Barry/Josephine/Miss Josephine Barry</b></font>)</div>said Miss Barry.

She (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) was a more agreeable guest than usual, for Anne kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in good humor. They became firm friends. When Miss Barry went away she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Remember, you Anne-girl, when you come to town you're to visit me and I'll put you in my very sparest spare-room bed to sleep.''

<p/>You don't find it right out at first, as in Matthew's case, but after a while you come to see it. Kindred spirits are not so scarce as I used to think. It's splendid to find out there are so many of them in the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XX. A Good Imagination Gone Wrong |SPRING had come once more to Green Gables--the beautiful capricious, reluctant Canadian spring, lingering along through April and May in a succession of sweet, fresh, chilly days, with pink sunsets and miracles of resurrection and growth. The maples in Lover's Lane were red budded and little curly ferns pushed up around the Dryad's Bubble. Away up in the barrens, behind Mr. Silas Sloane's place, the Mayflowers blossomed out, pink and white stars of sweetness under their brown leaves. All the school girls and boys had one golden afternoon gathering them, coming home in the clear, echoing twilight with arms and baskets full of flowery spoil. <div class="bookquote">``I'm so sorry for people who live in lands where there are no Mayflowers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne. '' Diana says perhaps they have something better, but there couldn't be anything better than Mayflowers, could there, Marilla? And Diana says if they don't know what they are like they don't miss them. But I think that is the saddest thing of all. I think it would be tragic , Marilla, not to know what Mayflowers are like and not to miss them. Do you know what I think Mayflowers are, Marilla? I think they must be the souls of the flowers that died last summer and this is their heaven. But we had a splendid time today, Marilla. We had our lunch down in a big mossy hollow by an old well--such a romantic spot.
<p/>Charlie Sloane dared Arty Gillis to jump over it, and Arty did because he (<font color='blue'><b>Sloane</b></font>) wouldn't take a dare. Nobody would in school. It is very fashionable to dare. Mr. Phillips gave all the Mayflowers he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) found to Prissy Andrews and I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) to say `sweets to the sweet.' He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) got that out of a book, I know; but it shows he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) has some imagination. I was offered some Mayflowers too, but I rejected them with scorn. I can't tell you the person's name because I have vowed never to let it cross my lips. We made wreaths of the Mayflowers and put them on our hats; and when the time came to go home we marched in procession down the road, two by two, with our bouquets and wreaths, singing ' My Home on the Hill.' Oh, it was so thrilling, Marilla. All Mr. Silas Sloane's folks rushed out to see us and everybody we met on the road stopped and stared after us. We made a real sensation.'' <div class="bookquote">``Not much wonder! Such silly doings!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>was Marilla's response. After the Mayflowers came the violets, and Violet Vale was empurpled with them. Anne walked through it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) way to school with reverent steps and worshiping eyes, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) trod on holy ground. '' Somehow,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) told Diana, <div class="bookquote">``when I'm going through here I don't really care whether Gil--whether anybody gets ahead of me in class or not. But when I'm up in school it's all different and I care as much as ever. There's such a lot of different Annes in me. I sometimes think that is why I'm such a troublesome person. If I was just the one Anne it would be ever so much more comfortable, but then it wouldn't be half so interesting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div><p/>One June evening, when the orchards were pink blossomed again, when the frogs were singing silverly sweet in the marshes about the head of the Lake of Shining Waters, and the air was full of the savor of clover fields and balsamic fir woods, Anne was sitting by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gable window. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been studying her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lessons, but it had grown too dark to see the book, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had fallen into wide-eyed reverie, looking out past the boughs of the Snow Queen, once more bestarred with its tufts of blossom. In all essential respects the little gable chamber was unchanged. The walls were as white, the pincushion as hard, the chairs as stiffly and yellowly upright as ever. Yet the whole character of the room was altered. It was full of a new vital, pulsing personality that seemed to pervade it and to be quite independent of schoolgirl books and dresses and ribbons, and even of the cracked blue jug full of apple blossoms on the table. It was as if all the dreams, sleeping and waking, of its vivid occupant had taken a visible although unmaterial form and had tapestried the bare room with splendid filmy tissues of rainbow and moonshine. Presently Marilla came briskly in with some of Anne's freshly ironed school aprons. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hung them over a chair and sat down with a short sigh. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had had one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) headaches that afternoon, and although the pain had gone she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt weak and <div class="bookquote">``tuckered out,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) expressed it. Anne looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) with eyes limpid with sympathy. <div class="bookquote">``I do truly wish I could have had the headache in your place, Marilla. I would have endured it joyfully for your sake.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess you did your part in attending to the work and letting me rest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``You seem to have got on fairly well and made fewer mistakes than usual. Of course it wasn't exactly necessary to starch Matthew's handkerchiefs! And most people when they put a pie in the oven to warm up for dinner take it out and eat it when it gets hot instead of leaving it to be burned to a crisp. But that doesn't seem to be your way evidently. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Headaches always left Marilla somewhat sarcastic. '' Oh, I'm so sorry,'' said Anne penitently. <div class="bookquote">``I never thought about that pie from the moment I put it in the oven till now, although I felt instinctively that there was something missing on the dinner table. I was firmly resolved, when you left me in charge this morning, not to imagine anything, but keep my thoughts on facts. I did pretty well until I put the pie in, and then an irresistible temptation came to me to imagine I was an enchanted princess shut up in a lonely tower with a handsome knight riding to my rescue on a coal-black steed. So that is how I came to forget the pie. I didn't know I starched the handkerchiefs. All the time I was ironing I was trying to think of a name for a new island Diana and I have discovered up the brook. It's the most ravishing spot, Marilla. There are two maple trees on it and the brook flows right around it. At last it struck me that it would be splendid to call it Victoria Island because we found it on the Queen's birthday. Both Diana and I are very loyal. But I'm sorry about that pie and the handkerchiefs.
<p/>I wanted to be extra good today because it's an anniversary. Do you remember what happened this day last year, Marilla?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I can't think of anything special.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Marilla, it was the day I came to Green Gables. I shall never forget it. It was the turning point in my life. Of course it wouldn't seem so important to you. I've been here for a year and I've been so happy. Of course, I've had my troubles, but one can live down troubles. Are you sorry you kept me, Marilla?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I can't say I'm sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, who sometimes wondered how she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) could have lived before Anne came to Green Gables, <div class="bookquote">``no, not exactly sorry. If you've finished your lessons, Anne, I want you to run over and ask Mrs. Barry if she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>)'ll lend me Diana's apron pattern.''  (<font color='red'><b>Green</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh--it's--it's too dark,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>cried Anne. <div class="bookquote">``Too dark?

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll go over early in the morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``I'll get up at sunrise and go over, Marilla.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What has got into your head now, Anne Shirley? I want that pattern to cut out your new apron this evening. Go at once and be smart too.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll have to go around by the road, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne, taking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hat reluctantly. <div class="bookquote">``Go by the road and waste half an hour! I'd like to catch you!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't go through the Haunted Wood, Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>cried Anne desperately. Marilla stared. '' The Haunted Wood! Are you crazy? What under the canopy is the Haunted Wood?'' <div class="bookquote">``The spruce wood over the brook,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne in a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``Fiddlesticks! There is no such thing as a haunted wood anywhere. Who has been telling you such stuff?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nobody,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>confessed Anne.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Diana and I just imagined the wood was haunted. All the places around here are so--so-- commonplace . We just got this up for our own amusement. We began it in April. A haunted wood is so very romantic, Marilla. We chose the spruce grove because it's so gloomy. Oh, we have imagined the most harrowing things. There's a white lady walks along the brook just about this time of the night and wrings her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands and utters wailing cries. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) appears when there is to be a death in the family. And the ghost of a little murdered child haunts the corner up by Idlewild; it creeps up behind you and lays its cold fingers on your hand--so. Oh, Marilla, it gives me a shudder to think of it. And there's a headless man stalks up and down the path and skeletons glower at you between the boughs. Oh, Marilla, I wouldn't go through the Haunted Wood after dark now for anything. I'd be sure that white things would reach out from behind the trees and grab me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did ever anyone hear the like!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Marilla, who had listened in dumb amazement. '' Anne Shirley, do you mean to tell me you believe all that wicked nonsense of your own imagination?'' <div class="bookquote">``Not believe exactly ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>faltered Anne. <div class="bookquote">``At least, I don't believe it in daylight. But after dark, Marilla, it's different. That is when ghosts walk.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There are no such things as ghosts, Anne.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, but there are, Marilla,'' cried Anne eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``I know people who have seen them. And they are respectable people. Charlie Sloane says that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sloane</b></font>) grandmother saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Sloane</b></font>) grandfather driving home the cows one night after he (<font color='blue'><b>Sloane</b></font>)'d been buried for a year. You know Charlie Sloane's grandmother wouldn't tell a story for anything.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>)'s a very religious woman. And Mrs. Thomas's father was pursued home one night by a lamb of fire with its head cut off hanging by a strip of skin. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew it was the spirit of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brother and that it was a warning he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would die within nine days. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) didn't, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) died two years after, so you see it was really true. And Ruby Gillis says--''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Anne Shirley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>interrupted Marilla firmly, <div class="bookquote">``I never want to hear you talking in this fashion again. I've had my doubts about that imagination of yours right along, and if this is going to be the outcome of it, I won't countenance any such doings. You'll go right over to Barry's, and you'll go through that spruce grove, just for a lesson and a warning to you. And never let me hear a word out of your head about haunted woods again. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Anne might plead and cry as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) liked--and did, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) terror was very real. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) imagination had run away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) held the spruce grove in mortal dread after nightfall. But Marilla was inexorable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) marched the shrinking ghost-seer down to the spring and ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) to proceed straightaway over the bridge and into the dusky retreats of wailing ladies and headless specters beyond. '' Oh, Marilla, how can you be so cruel? '' sobbed Anne. <div class="bookquote">``What would you feel like if a white thing did snatch me up and carry me off?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll risk it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla unfeelingly. <div class="bookquote">``You know I always mean what I say. I'll cure you of imagining ghosts into places. March, now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne marched. That is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) stumbled over the bridge and went shuddering up the horrible dim path beyond. Anne never forgot that walk.
<p/>Bitterly did she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) repent the license she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) imagination. The goblins of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) fancy lurked in every shadow about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), reaching out their cold, fleshless hands to grasp the terrified small girl who had called them into being. A white strip of birch bark blowing up from the hollow over the brown floor of the grove made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart stand still. The long-drawn wail of two old boughs rubbing against each other brought out the perspiration in beads on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) forehead. The swoop of bats in the darkness over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was as the wings of unearthly creatures. When she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) reached Mr. William Bell's field she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fled across it as if pursued by an army of white things, and arrived at the Barry kitchen door so out of breath that she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) could hardly gasp out her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) request for the apron pattern. Diana was away so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) had no excuse to linger. The dreadful return journey had to be faced. Anne went back over it with shut eyes, preferring to take the risk of dashing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) brains out among the boughs to that of seeing a white thing. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) finally stumbled over the log bridge she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) drew one long shivering breath of relief. '' Well, so nothing caught you?'' said Marilla unsympathetically. '' Oh, Mar--Marilla,'' chattered Anne, <div class="bookquote">``I'll b-b-be contt-tented with c-c-commonplace places after this.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXI. A New Departure in Flavorings |DEAR ME, there is nothing but meetings and partings in this world, as Mrs. Lynde says,'' remarked Anne plaintively, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) slate and books down on the kitchen table on the last day of June and wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) red eyes with a very damp handkerchief. <div class="bookquote">``Wasn't it fortunate, Marilla, that I took an extra handkerchief to school today?
<p/>I had a presentiment that it would be needed.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I never thought you were so fond of Mr. Phillips that you'd require two handkerchiefs to dry your tears just because he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) was going away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I was crying because I was really so very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>reflected Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I just cried because all the others did. It was Ruby Gillis started it. Ruby Gillis has always declared she (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) hated Mr. Phillips, but just as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) got up to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) farewell speech she (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) burst into tears. Then all the girls began to cry, one after the other. I tried to hold out, Marilla. I tried to remember the time Mr. Phillips made me sit with Gil--with a boy; and the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) spelled my name without an `e' on the blackboard; and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) said I was the worst dunce he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) ever saw at geometry and laughed at my spelling; and all the times he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) had been so horrid and sarcastic; but somehow I couldn't, Marilla, and I just had to cry too. Jane Andrews has been talking for a month about how glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>)'d be when Mr. Phillips went away and she (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) declared she (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>)'d never shed a tear. Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) was worse than any of us and had to borrow a handkerchief from her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) brother--of course the boys didn't cry--because she (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) hadn't brought one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) own, not expecting to need it. Oh, Marilla, it was heartrending. Mr. Phillips made such a beautiful farewell speech beginning, `The time has come for us to part.' It was very affecting. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) had tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) eyes too, Marilla.
<p/>Oh, I felt dreadfully sorry and remorseful for all the times I'd talked in school and drawn pictures of him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) on my slate and made fun of him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) and Prissy. I can tell you I wished I'd been a model pupil like Minnie Andrews. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) hadn't anything on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) conscience. The girls cried all the way home from school. Carrie Sloane kept saying every few minutes, `The time has come for us to part,' and that would start us off again whenever we were in any danger of cheering up. I do feel dreadfully sad, Marilla. But one can't feel quite in the depths of despair with two months' vacation before them, can they, Marilla? And besides, we met the new minister and his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) wife coming from the station. For all I was feeling so bad about Mr. Phillips going away I couldn't help taking a little interest in a new minister, could I? His (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) wife is very pretty. Not exactly regally lovely, of course--it wouldn't do, I suppose, for a minister to have a regally lovely wife, because it might set a bad example. Mrs. Lynde says the minister's wife over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) dresses so fashionably. Our new minister's wife was dressed in blue muslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses. Jane Andrews said she (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for a minister's wife, but I didn't make any such uncharitable remark, Marilla, because I know what it is to long for puffed sleeves. Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s only been a minister's wife for a little while, so one should make allowances, shouldn't they? They are going to board with Mrs. Lynde until the manse is ready.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>If Marilla, in going down to Mrs. Lynde's that evening, was actuated by any motive save her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) avowed one of returning the quilting frames she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had borrowed the preceding winter, it was an amiable weakness shared by most of the Avonlea people. Many a thing Mrs. Lynde had lent, sometimes never expecting to see it again, came home that night in charge of the borrowers thereof. A new minister, and moreover a minister with a wife, was a lawful object of curiosity in a quiet little country settlement where sensations were few and far between. Old Mr. Bentley, the minister whom Anne had found lacking in imagination, had been pastor of Avonlea for eighteen years. He (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) was a widower when he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) came, and a widower he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) remained, despite the fact that gossip regularly married him (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) to this, that, or the other one, every year of his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) sojourn. In the preceding February he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) had resigned his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) charge and departed amid the regrets of his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) people, most of whom had the affection born of long intercourse for their good old minister in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) shortcomings as an orator. Since then the Avonlea church had enjoyed a variety of religious dissipation in listening to the many and various candidates and <div class="bookquote">``supplies''  (<font color='red'><b>the candidates supplies</b></font>)</div>who came Sunday after Sunday to preach on trial. These stood or fell by the judgment of the fathers and mothers in Israel; but a certain small, red-haired girl who sat meekly in the corner of the old Cuthbert pew also had her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) opinions about them and discussed the same in full with Matthew, Marilla always declining from principle to criticize ministers in any shape or form. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think Mr. Smith would have done, Matthew''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>was Anne's final summing up. ''
<p/>Mrs. Lynde says his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) delivery was so poor, but I think his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) worst fault was just like Mr. Bentley's--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bentley</b></font>) had no imagination. And Mr. Terry had too much; he (<font color='blue'><b>Terry</b></font>) let it run away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Terry</b></font>) just as I did mine in the matter of the Haunted Wood. Besides, Mrs. Lynde says his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) theology wasn't sound. Mr. Gresham was a very good man and a very religious man, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gresham</b></font>) told too many funny stories and made the people laugh in church; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gresham</b></font>) was undignified, and you must have some dignity about a minister, mustn't you, Matthew? I thought Mr. Marshall was decidedly attractive; but Mrs. Lynde says he (<font color='blue'><b>Marshall</b></font>) isn't married, or even engaged, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) made special inquiries about him (<font color='blue'><b>Marshall</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) says it would never do to have a young unmarried minister in Avonlea, because he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) might marry in the congregation and that would make trouble. Mrs. Lynde is a very farseeing woman, isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>), Matthew? I'm very glad they've called Mr. Allan. I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) because his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) sermon was interesting and he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) prayed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) meant it and not just as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) did it because he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) was in the habit of it. Mrs. Lynde says he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) isn't perfect, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) supposes we couldn't expect a perfect minister for seven hundred and fifty dollars a year, and anyhow his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) theology is sound because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) thoroughly on all the points of doctrine. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) knows his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) wife's people and they are most respectable and the women are all good housekeepers. Mrs. Lynde says that sound doctrine in the man and good housekeeping in the woman make an ideal combination for a minister's family.
<p/>'' The new minister and his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) wife were a young, pleasant-faced couple, still on their honeymoon, and full of all good and beautiful enthusiasms for their chosen lifework. Avonlea opened its heart to them from the start. Old and young liked the frank, cheerful young man with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) high ideals, and the bright, gentle little lady who assumed the mistress-ship of the manse. With Mrs. Allan Anne fell promptly and wholeheartedly in love. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had discovered another kindred spirit. '' Mrs. Allan is perfectly lovely,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) announced one Sunday afternoon. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)'s taken our class and she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)'s a splendid teacher. She (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) said right away she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) didn't think it was fair for the teacher to ask all the questions, and you know, Marilla, that is exactly what I've always thought. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) said we could ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) any question we liked and I asked ever so many. I'm good at asking questions, Marilla.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I believe you''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>was Marilla's emphatic comment. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody else asked any except Ruby Gillis, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) asked if there was to be a Sunday-school picnic this summer. I didn't think that was a very proper question to ask because it hadn't any connection with the lesson--the lesson was about Daniel in the lions' den--but Mrs. Allan just smiled and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) thought there would be. Mrs. Allan has a lovely smile; she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) has such exquisite dimples in her (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) cheeks. I wish I had dimples in my cheeks, Marilla. I'm not half so skinny as I was when I came here, but I have no dimples yet. If I had perhaps I could influence people for good. Mrs. Allan said we ought always to try to influence other people for good. She (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) talked so nice about everything. I never knew before that religion was such a cheerful thing.
<p/>I always thought it was kind of melancholy, but Mrs. Allan's isn't, and I'd like to be a Christian if I could be one like her (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>). I wouldn't want to be one like Mr. Superintendent Bell.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's very naughty of you to speak so about Mr. Bell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla severely. '' Mr. Bell is a real good man.'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>)'s good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>agreed Anne, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) doesn't seem to get any comfort out of it. If I could be good I'd dance and sing all day because I was glad of it. I suppose Mrs. Allan is too old to dance and sing and of course it wouldn't be dignified in a minister's wife. But I can just feel she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)'s glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)'s a Christian and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)'d be one even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) could get to heaven without it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I suppose we must have Mr. and Mrs. Allan up to tea someday soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla reflectively. <div class="bookquote">``They've been most everywhere but here. Let me see. Next Wednesday would be a good time to have them. But don't say a word to Matthew about it, for if he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) knew they were coming he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)'d find some excuse to be away that day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)'d got so used to Mr. Bentley he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) didn't mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)'s going to find it hard to get acquainted with a new minister, and a new minister's wife will frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) to death.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll be as secret as the dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>assured Anne. '' But oh, Marilla, will you let me make a cake for the occasion? I'd love to do something for Mrs. Allan, and you know I can make a pretty good cake by this time.'' <div class="bookquote">``You can make a layer cake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>promised Marilla. Monday and Tuesday great preparations went on at Green Gables.
<p/>Having the minister and his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) wife to tea was a serious and important undertaking, and Marilla was determined not to be eclipsed by any of the Avonlea housekeepers. Anne was wild with excitement and delight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) talked it all over with Diana Tuesday night in the twilight, as they sat on the big red stones by the Dryad's Bubble and made rainbows in the water with little twigs dipped in fir balsam. <div class="bookquote">``Everything is ready, Diana, except my cake which I'm to make in the morning, and the baking-powder biscuits which Marilla will make just before teatime. I assure you, Diana, that Marilla and I have had a busy two days of it. It's such a responsibility having a minister's family to tea. I never went through such an experience before. You should just see our pantry. It's a sight to behold. We're going to have jellied chicken and cold tongue. We're to have two kinds of jelly, red and yellow, and whipped cream and lemon pie, and cherry pie, and three kinds of cookies, and fruit cake, and Marilla's famous yellow plum preserves that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) keeps especially for ministers, and pound cake and layer cake, and biscuits as aforesaid; and new bread and old both, in case the minister is dyspeptic and can't eat new. Mrs. Lynde says ministers are dyspeptic, but I don't think Mr. Allan has been a minister long enough for it to have had a bad effect on him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>). I just grow cold when I think of my layer cake. Oh, Diana, what if it shouldn't be good! I dreamed last night that I was chased all around by a fearful goblin with a big layer cake for a head.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It'll be good, all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>assured Diana, who was a very comfortable sort of friend.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure that piece of the one you made that we had for lunch in Idlewild two weeks ago was perfectly elegant.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes; but cakes have such a terrible habit of turning out bad just when you especially want them to be good,'' sighed Anne, setting a particularly well-balsamed twig afloat. '' However, I suppose I shall just have to trust to Providence and be careful to put in the flour. Oh, look, Diana, what a lovely rainbow! Do you suppose the dryad will come out after we go away and take it for a scarf?'' <div class="bookquote">``You know there is no such thing as a dryad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana. Diana's mother had found out about the Haunted Wood and had been decidedly angry over it. As a result Diana had abstained from any further imitative flights of imagination and did not think it prudent to cultivate a spirit of belief even in harmless dryads. '' But it's so easy to imagine there is,'' said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``Every night before I go to bed, I look out of my window and wonder if the dryad is really sitting here, combing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) locks with the spring for a mirror. Sometimes I look for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) footprints in the dew in the morning. Oh, Diana, don't give up your faith in the dryad!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Wednesday morning came. Anne got up at sunrise because she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was too excited to sleep. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had caught a severe cold in the head by reason of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) dabbling in the spring on the preceding evening; but nothing short of absolute pneumonia could have quenched her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) interest in culinary matters that morning. After breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) proceeded to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cake. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) finally shut the oven door upon it she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) drew a long breath.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I haven't forgotten anything this time, Marilla. But do you think it will rise? Just suppose perhaps the baking powder isn't good? I used it out of the new can. And Mrs. Lynde says you can never be sure of getting good baking powder nowadays when everything is so adulterated. Mrs. Lynde says the Government ought to take the matter up, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) says we'll never see the day when a Tory Government will do it. Marilla, what if that cake doesn't rise?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We'll have plenty without it''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>was Marilla's unimpassioned way of looking at the subject. The cake did rise, however, and came out of the oven as light and feathery as golden foam. Anne, flushed with delight, clapped it together with layers of ruby jelly and, in imagination, saw Mrs. Allan eating it and possibly asking for another piece! <div class="bookquote">``You'll be using the best tea set, of course, Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Can I fix the table with ferns and wild roses?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think that's all nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>sniffed Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``In my opinion it's the eatables that matter and not flummery decorations.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Barry had her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) table decorated,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne, who was not entirely guiltless of the wisdom of the serpent, <div class="bookquote">``and the minister paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) an elegant compliment. He (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) said it was a feast for the eye as well as the palate.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, do as you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, who was quite determined not to be surpassed by Mrs. Barry or anybody else. '' Only mind you leave enough room for the dishes and the food.'' Anne laid herself out to decorate in a manner and after a fashion that should leave Mrs. Barry's nowhere.
<p/>Having abundance of roses and ferns and a very artistic taste of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) own, she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) made that tea table such a thing of beauty that when the minister and his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) wife sat down to it they exclaimed in chorus over it loveliness. <div class="bookquote">``It's Anne's doings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, grimly just; and Anne felt that Mrs. Allan's approving smile was almost too much happiness for this world. Matthew was there, having been inveigled into the party only goodness and Anne knew how. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had been in such a state of shyness and nervousness that Marilla had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) up in despair, but Anne took him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) in hand so successfully that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) now sat at the table in his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) best clothes and white collar and talked to the minister not uninterestingly. He (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) never said a word to Mrs. Allan, but that perhaps was not to be expected. All went merry as a marriage bell until Anne's layer cake was passed. Mrs. Allan, having already been helped to a bewildering variety, declined it. But Marilla, seeing the disappointment on Anne's face, said smilingly: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you must take a piece of this, Mrs. Allan. Anne made it on purpose for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``In that case I must sample it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allan</b></font>)</div>laughed Mrs. Allan, helping herself to a plump triangle, as did also the minister and Marilla. Mrs. Allan took a mouthful of hers and a most peculiar expression crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) face; not a word did she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) say, however, but steadily ate away at it. Marilla saw the expression and hastened to taste the cake. '' Anne Shirley! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``what on earth did you put into that cake?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing but what the recipe said, Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>cried Anne with a look of anguish. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, isn't it all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' All right! It's simply horrible.
<p/>Mr. Allan, don't try to eat it. Anne, taste it yourself. What flavoring did you use?'' <div class="bookquote">``Vanilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face scarlet with mortification after tasting the cake. '' Only vanilla. Oh, Marilla, it must have been the baking powder. I had my suspicions of that bak--'' <div class="bookquote">``Baking powder fiddlesticks! Go and bring me the bottle of vanilla you used.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Anne fled to the pantry and returned with a small bottle partially filled with a brown liquid and labeled yellowly, <div class="bookquote">``Best Vanilla. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Marilla took it, uncorked it, smelled it. <div class="bookquote">``Mercy on us, Anne, you've flavored that cake with Anodyne Liniment . I broke the liniment bottle last week and poured what was left into an old empty vanilla bottle. I suppose it's partly my fault--I should have warned you--but for pity's sake why couldn't you have smelled it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne dissolved into tears under this double disgrace. <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't--I had such a cold!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and with this she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) fairly fled to the gable chamber, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cast herself on the bed and wept as one who refuses to be comforted. Presently a light step sounded on the stairs and somebody entered the room. '' Oh, Marilla,'' sobbed Anne, without looking up, <div class="bookquote">``I'm disgraced forever. I shall never be able to live this down. It will get out--things always do get out in Avonlea. Diana will ask me how my cake turned out and I shall have to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) the truth. I shall always be pointed at as the girl who flavored a cake with anodyne liniment. Gil--the boys in school will never get over laughing at it. Oh, Marilla, if you have a spark of Christian pity don't tell me that I must go down and wash the dishes after this.
<p/>I'll wash them when the minister and his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) wife are gone, but I cannot ever look Mrs. Allan in the face again. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)'ll think I tried to poison her (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>). Mrs. Lynde says she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) knows an orphan girl who tried to poison her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) benefactor. But the liniment isn't poisonous. It's meant to be taken internally--although not in cakes. Won't you tell Mrs. Allan so, Marilla?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Suppose you jump up and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) so yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said a merry voice. Anne flew up, to find Mrs. Allan standing by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) bed, surveying her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) with laughing eyes. <div class="bookquote">``My dear little girl, you mustn't cry like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, genuinely disturbed by Anne's tragic face. '' Why, it's all just a funny mistake that anybody might make.'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, it takes me to make such a mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne forlornly. '' And I wanted to have that cake so nice for you, Mrs. Allan.'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know, dear. And I assure you I appreciate your kindness and thoughtfulness just as much as if it had turned out all right. Now, you mustn't cry any more, but come down with me and show me your flower garden. Miss Cuthbert tells me you have a little plot all your own. I want to see it, for I'm very much interested in flowers. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne permitted herself to be led down and comforted, reflecting that it was really providential that Mrs. Allan was a kindred spirit. Nothing more was said about the liniment cake, and when the guests went away Anne found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had enjoyed the evening more than could have been expected, considering that terrible incident. Nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sighed deeply. <div class="bookquote">``Marilla, isn't it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no mistakes in it yet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll warrant you'll make plenty in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``I never saw your beat for making mistakes, Anne.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, and well I know it,'' admitted Anne mournfully. <div class="bookquote">``But have you ever noticed one encouraging thing about me, Marilla? I never make the same mistake twice.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know as that's much benefit when you're always making new ones.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't you see, Marilla? There must be a limit to the mistakes one person can make, and when I get to the end of them, then I'll be through with them. That's a very comforting thought.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, you'd better go and give that cake to the pigs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``It isn't fit for any human to eat, not even Jerry Boute.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXII. Anne is Invited Out to Tea |AND what are your eyes popping out of your head about. Now? '' asked Marilla, when Anne had just come in from a run to the post office. '' Have you discovered another kindred spirit?'' Excitement hung around Anne like a garment, shone in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes, kindled in every feature. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had come dancing up the lane, like a wind-blown sprite, through the mellow sunshine and lazy shadows of the August evening. '' No, Marilla, but oh, what do you think? I am invited to tea at the manse tomorrow afternoon! Mrs. Allan left the letter for me at the post office. Just look at it, Marilla. ' Miss Anne Shirley, Green Gables.' That is the first time I was ever called `Miss.' Such a thrill as it gave me! I shall cherish it forever among my choicest treasures.'' <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Allan told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) meant to have all the members of her (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) Sunday-school class to tea in turn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, regarding the wonderful event very coolly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't get in such a fever over it. Do learn to take things calmly, child.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>For Anne to take things calmly would have been to change her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) nature. All <div class="bookquote">``spirit and fire and dew,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was, the pleasures and pains of life came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) with trebled intensity. Marilla felt this and was vaguely troubled over it, realizing that the ups and downs of existence would probably bear hardly on this impulsive soul and not sufficiently understanding that the equally great capacity for delight might more than compensate. Therefore Marilla conceived it to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) duty to drill Anne into a tranquil uniformity of disposition as impossible and alien to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) as to a dancing sunbeam in one of the brook shallows. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) did not make much headway, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) sorrowfully admitted to herself. The downfall of some dear hope or plan plunged Anne into <div class="bookquote">``deeps of affliction. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>The fulfillment thereof exalted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to dizzy realms of delight. Marilla had almost begun to despair of ever fashioning this waif of the world into her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) model little girl of demure manners and prim deportment. Neither would she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) have believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) really liked Anne much better as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was. Anne went to bed that night speechless with misery because Matthew had said the wind was round northeast and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) feared it would be a rainy day tomorrow. The rustle of the poplar leaves about the house worried her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), it sounded so like pattering raindrops, and the full, faraway roar of the gulf, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) listened delightedly at other times, loving its strange, sonorous, haunting rhythm, now seemed like a prophecy of storm and disaster to a small maiden who particularly wanted a fine day. Anne thought that the morning would never come.
<p/>But all things have an end, even nights before the day on which you are invited to take tea at the manse. The morning, in spite of Matthew's predictions, was fine and Anne's spirits soared to their highest. '' Oh, Marilla, there is something in me today that makes me just love everybody I see,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) exclaimed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) washed the breakfast dishes. <div class="bookquote">``You don't know how good I feel! Wouldn't it be nice if it could last? I believe I could be a model child if I were just invited out to tea every day. But oh, Marilla, it's a solemn occasion too. I feel so anxious. What if I shouldn't behave properly? You know I never had tea at a manse before, and I'm not sure that I know all the rules of etiquette, although I've been studying the rules given in the Etiquette Department of the Family Herald ever since I came here. I'm so afraid I'll do something silly or forget to do something I should do. Would it be good manners to take a second helping of anything if you wanted to very much?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The trouble with you, Anne, is that you're thinking too much about yourself. You should just think of Mrs. Allan and what would be nicest and most agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, hitting for once in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) life on a very sound and pithy piece of advice. Anne instantly realized this. <div class="bookquote">``You are right, Marilla. I'll try not to think about myself at all. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne evidently got through her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) visit without any serious breach of <div class="bookquote">``etiquette,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>for she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) came home through the twilight, under a great, high-sprung sky gloried over with trails of saffron and rosy cloud, in a beatified state of mind and told Marilla all about it happily, sitting on the big red-sandstone slab at the kitchen door with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) tired curly head in Marilla's gingham lap. A cool wind was blowing down over the long harvest fields from the rims of firry western hills and whistling through the poplars. One clear star hung over the orchard and the fireflies were flitting over in Lover's Lane, in and out among the ferns and rustling boughs. Anne watched them as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) talked and somehow felt that wind and stars and fireflies were all tangled up together into something unutterably sweet and enchanting. '' Oh, Marilla, I've had a most fascinating time. I feel that I have not lived in vain and I shall always feel like that even if I should never be invited to tea at a manse again. When I got there Mrs. Allan met me at the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) was dressed in the sweetest dress of pale-pink organdy, with dozens of frills and elbow sleeves, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) looked just like a seraph. I really think I'd like to be a minister's wife when I grow up, Marilla. A minister mightn't mind my red hair because he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) wouldn't be thinking of such worldly things. But then of course one would have to be naturally good and I'll never be that, so I suppose there's no use in thinking about it. Some people are naturally good, you know, and others are not. I'm one of the others. Mrs. Lynde says I'm full of original sin.
<p/>No matter how hard I try to be good I can never make such a success of it as those who are naturally good. It's a good deal like geometry, I expect. But don't you think the trying so hard ought to count for something? Mrs. Allan is one of the naturally good people. I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) passionately. You know there are some people, like Matthew and Mrs. Allan that you can love right off without any trouble. And there are others, like Mrs. Lynde, that you have to try very hard to love. You know you ought to love them because they know so much and are such active workers in the church, but you have to keep reminding yourself of it all the time or else you forget. There was another little girl at the manse to tea, from the White Sands Sunday school. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) name was Laurette Bradley, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a very nice little girl. Not exactly a kindred spirit, you know, but still very nice. We had an elegant tea, and I think I kept all the rules of etiquette pretty well. After tea Mrs. Allan played and sang and she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) got Lauretta and me to sing too. Mrs. Allan says I have a good voice and she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) says I must sing in the Sunday-school choir after this. You can't think how I was thrilled at the mere thought. I've longed so to sing in the Sunday-school choir, as Diana does, but I feared it was an honor I could never aspire to. Lauretta had to go home early because there is a big concert in the White Sands Hotel tonight and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lauretta</b></font>) sister is to recite at it.
<p/>Lauretta says that the Americans at the hotel give a concert every fortnight in aid of the Charlottetown hospital, and they ask lots of the White Sands people to recite. Lauretta said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lauretta</b></font>) expected to be asked herself someday. I just gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lauretta</b></font>) in awe. After she (<font color='blue'><b>Lauretta</b></font>) had gone Mrs. Allan and I had a heart-to-heart talk. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) everything--about Mrs. Thomas and the twins and Katie Maurice and Violetta and coming to Green Gables and my troubles over geometry. And would you believe it, Marilla? Mrs. Allan told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) was a dunce at geometry too. You don't know how that encouraged me. Mrs. Lynde came to the manse just before I left, and what do you think, Marilla? The trustees have hired a new teacher and it's a lady. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name is Miss Muriel Stacy. Isn't that a romantic name? Mrs. Lynde says they've never had a female teacher in Avonlea before and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) thinks it is a dangerous innovation. But I think it will be splendid to have a lady teacher, and I really don't see how I'm going to live through the two weeks before school begins. I'm so impatient to see her (<font color='blue'><b>teacher</b></font>).'' CHAPTER XXIII. Anne Comes to Grief in an Affair of Honor |ANNE had to live through more than two weeks, as it happened. Almost a month having elapsed since the liniment cake episode, it was high time for her (<font color='blue'><b>ANNE</b></font>) to get into fresh trouble of some sort, little mistakes, such as absentmindedly emptying a pan of skim milk into a basket of yarn balls in the pantry instead of into the pigs' bucket, and walking clean over the edge of the log bridge into the brook while wrapped in imaginative reverie, not really being worth counting.
<p/>A week after the tea at the manse Diana Barry gave a party. '' Small and select,'' Anne assured Marilla. '' Just the girls in our class. '' They had a very good time and nothing untoward happened until after tea, when they found themselves in the Barry garden, a little tired of all their games and ripe for any enticing form of mischief which might present itself. This presently took the form of <div class="bookquote">``daring.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Daring was the fashionable amusement among the Avonlea small fry just then. It had begun among the boys, but soon spread to the girls, and all the silly things that were done in Avonlea that summer because the doers thereof were <div class="bookquote">``dared''  (<font color='red'><b>the doers</b></font>)</div>to do them would fill a book by themselves. First of all Carrie Sloane dared Ruby Gillis to climb to a certain point in the huge old willow tree before the front door; which Ruby Gillis, albeit in mortal dread of the fat green caterpillars with which said tree was infested and with the fear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) mother before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) eyes if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) should tear her (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) new muslin dress, nimbly did, to the discomfiture of the aforesaid Carrie Sloane. Then Josie Pye dared Jane Andrews to hop on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) left leg around the garden without stopping once or putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) right foot to the ground; which Jane Andrews gamely tried to do, but gave out at the third corner and had to confess herself defeated. Josie's triumph being rather more pronounced than good taste permitted, Anne Shirley dared her (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) to walk along the top of the board fence which bounded the garden to the east. Now, to <div class="bookquote">``walk''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>board fences requires more skill and steadiness of head and heel than one might suppose who has never tried it.
<p/>But Josie Pye, if deficient in some qualities that make for popularity, had at least a natural and inborn gift, duly cultivated, for walking board fences. Josie walked the Barry fence with an airy unconcern which seemed to imply that a little thing like that wasn't worth a <div class="bookquote">``dare.''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>Reluctant admiration greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Josie</b></font>) exploit, for most of the other girls could appreciate it, having suffered many things themselves in their efforts to walk fences. Josie descended from her (<font color='blue'><b>Josie</b></font>) perch, flushed with victory, and darted a defiant glance at Anne. Anne tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) red braids. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think it's such a very wonderful thing to walk a little, low, board fence,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I knew a girl in Marysville who could walk the ridgepole of a roof.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Josie Pye/Josie/Pye</b></font>)</div>said Josie flatly. <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe anybody could walk a ridgepole. You couldn't, anyhow. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>cried Anne rashly. <div class="bookquote">``Then I dare you to do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Josie Pye/Josie/Pye</b></font>)</div>said Josie defiantly. <div class="bookquote">``I dare you to climb up there and walk the ridgepole of Mr. Barry's kitchen roof.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne turned pale, but there was clearly only one thing to be done. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) walked toward the house, where a ladder was leaning against the kitchen roof. All the fifth-class girls said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>partly in excitement, partly in dismay. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you do it, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>entreated Diana. <div class="bookquote">``You'll fall off and be killed. Never mind Josie Pye. It isn't fair to dare anybody to do anything so dangerous.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I must do it. My honor is at stake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne solemnly. <div class="bookquote">``I shall walk that ridgepole, Diana, or perish in the attempt. If I am killed you are to have my pearl bead ring.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne climbed the ladder amid breathless silence, gained the ridgepole, balanced herself uprightly on that precarious footing, and started to walk along it, dizzily conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was uncomfortably high up in the world and that walking ridgepoles was not a thing in which your imagination helped you out much. Nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) managed to take several steps before the catastrophe came. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) swayed, lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) balance, stumbled, staggered, and fell, sliding down over the sun-baked roof and crashing off it through the tangle of Virginia creeper beneath--all before the dismayed circle below could give a simultaneous, terrified shriek. If Anne had tumbled off the roof on the side up which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had ascended Diana would probably have fallen heir to the pearl bead ring then and there. Fortunately she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) fell on the other side, where the roof extended down over the porch so nearly to the ground that a fall therefrom was a much less serious thing. Nevertheless, when Diana and the other girls had rushed frantically around the house--except Ruby Gillis, who remained as if rooted to the ground and went into hysterics--they found Anne lying all white and limp among the wreck and ruin of the Virginia creeper. <div class="bookquote">``Anne, are you killed? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>shrieked Diana, throwing herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knees beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend. '' Oh, Anne, dear Anne, speak just one word to me and tell me if you're killed. '' To the immense relief of all the girls, and especially of Josie Pye, who, in spite of lack of imagination, had been seized with horrible visions of a future branded as the girl who was the cause of Anne Shirley's early and tragic death, Anne sat dizzily up and answered uncertainly: <div class="bookquote">``No, Diana, I am not killed, but I think I am rendered unconscious.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>Carrie Sloane</b></font>)</div>sobbed Carrie Sloane. '' Oh, where, Anne? '' Before Anne could answer Mrs. Barry appeared on the scene. At sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) Anne tried to scramble to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) feet, but sank back again with a sharp little cry of pain. <div class="bookquote">``What's the matter? Where have you hurt yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barry</b></font>)</div>demanded Mrs. Barry. <div class="bookquote">``My ankle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>gasped Anne. '' Oh, Diana, please find your father and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to take me home. I know I can never walk there. And I'm sure I couldn't hop so far on one foot when Jane couldn't even hop around the garden. '' Marilla was out in the orchard picking a panful of summer apples when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) saw Mr. Barry coming over the log bridge and up the slope, with Mrs. Barry beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) and a whole procession of little girls trailing after him (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>). In his (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) arms he (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) carried Anne, whose head lay limply against his (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) shoulder. At that moment Marilla had a revelation. In the sudden stab of fear that pierced her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) very heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) realized what Anne had come to mean to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would have admitted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) liked Anne--nay, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was very fond of Anne. But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hurried wildly down the slope that Anne was dearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) than anything else on earth. '' Mr. Barry, what has happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gasped, more white and shaken than the self-contained, sensible Marilla had been for many years. Anne herself answered, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head. '' Don't be very frightened, Marilla. I was walking the ridgepole and I fell off. I expect I have sprained my ankle. But, Marilla, I might have broken my neck. Let us look on the bright side of things.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I might have known you'd go and do something of the sort when I let you go to that party,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, sharp and shrewish in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) very relief. '' Bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) in here, Mr. Barry, and lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) on the sofa. Mercy me, the child has gone and fainted! '' It was quite true. Overcome by the pain of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) injury, Anne had one more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wishes granted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had fainted dead away. Matthew, hastily summoned from the harvest field, was straightway dispatched for the doctor, who in due time came, to discover that the injury was more serious than they had supposed. Anne's ankle was broken. That night, when Marilla went up to the east gable, where a white-faced girl was lying, a plaintive voice greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) from the bed. '' Aren't you very sorry for me, Marilla?'' <div class="bookquote">``It was your own fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, twitching down the blind and lighting a lamp. '' And that is just why you should be sorry for me,'' said Anne, <div class="bookquote">``because the thought that it is all my own fault is what makes it so hard. If I could blame it on anybody I would feel so much better. But what would you have done, Marilla, if you had been dared to walk a ridgepole?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'd have stayed on good firm ground and let them dare away. Such absurdity!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. Anne sighed. <div class="bookquote">``But you have such strength of mind, Marilla. I haven't. I just felt that I couldn't bear Josie Pye's scorn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) would have crowed over me all my life. And I think I have been punished so much that you needn't be very cross with me, Marilla. It's not a bit nice to faint, after all.
<p/>And the doctor hurt me dreadfully when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was setting my ankle. I won't be able to go around for six or seven weeks and I'll miss the new lady teacher. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) won't be new any more by the time I'm able to go to school. And Gil--everybody will get ahead of me in class. Oh, I am an afflicted mortal. But I'll try to bear it all bravely if only you won't be cross with me, Marilla.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There, there, I'm not cross,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``You're an unlucky child, there's no doubt about that; but as you say, you'll have the suffering of it. Here now, try and eat some supper.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it fortunate I've got such an imagination? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``It will help me through splendidly, I expect. What do people who haven't any imagination do when they break their bones, do you suppose, Marilla?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne had good reason to bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) imagination many a time and oft during the tedious seven weeks that followed. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was not solely dependent on it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had many visitors and not a day passed without one or more of the schoolgirls dropping in to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) flowers and books and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) all the happenings in the juvenile world of Avonlea. <div class="bookquote">``Everybody has been so good and kind, Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>sighed Anne happily, on the day when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) could first limp across the floor. <div class="bookquote">``It isn't very pleasant to be laid up; but there is a bright side to it, Marilla. You find out how many friends you have. Why, even Superintendent Bell came to see me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>)'s really a very fine man. Not a kindred spirit, of course; but still I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) and I'm awfully sorry I ever criticized his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) prayers.
<p/>I believe now he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) really does mean them, only he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) has got into the habit of saying them as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) didn't. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) could get over that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>)'d take a little trouble. I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) a good broad hint. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) how hard I tried to make my own little private prayers interesting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) told me all about the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) ankle when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) was a boy. It does seem so strange to think of Superintendent Bell ever being a boy. Even my imagination has its limits, for I can't imagine that . When I try to imagine him (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) as a boy I see him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with gray whiskers and spectacles, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looks in Sunday school, only small. Now, it's so easy to imagine Mrs. Allan as a little girl. Mrs. Allan has been to see me fourteen times. Isn't that something to be proud of, Marilla? When a minister's wife has so many claims on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) time! She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) is such a cheerful person to have visit you, too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) never tells you it's your own fault and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) hopes you'll be a better girl on account of it. Mrs. Lynde always told me that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) came to see me; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) said it in a kind of way that made me feel she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) might hope I'd be a better girl but didn't really believe I would. Even Josie Pye came to see me. I received her (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) as politely as I could, because I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) was sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) dared me to walk a ridgepole. If I had been killed she (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) would had to carry a dark burden of remorse all her (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) life. Diana has been a faithful friend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>)'s been over every day to cheer my lonely pillow.
<p/>But oh, I shall be so glad when I can go to school for I've heard such exciting things about the new teacher. The girls all think she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) is perfectly sweet. Diana says she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) has the loveliest fair curly hair and such fascinating eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) dresses beautifully, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) sleeve puffs are bigger than anybody else's in Avonlea. Every other Friday afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) has recitations and everybody has to say a piece or take part in a dialogue. Oh, it's just glorious to think of it. Josie Pye says she (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) hates it but that is just because Josie has so little imagination. Diana and Ruby Gillis and Jane Andrews are preparing a dialogue, called 'A Morning Visit,' for next Friday. And the Friday afternoons they don't have recitations Miss Stacy takes them all to the woods for a `field' day and they study ferns and flowers and birds. And they have physical culture exercises every morning and evening. Mrs. Lynde says she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) never heard of such goings on and it all comes of having a lady teacher. But I think it must be splendid and I believe I shall find that Miss Stacy is a kindred spirit.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There's one thing plain to be seen, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, <div class="bookquote">``and that is that your fall off the Barry roof hasn't injured your tongue at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXIV. Miss Stacy and Her (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) Pupils Get Up a Concert |IT was October again when Anne was ready to go back to school--a glorious October, all red and gold, with mellow mornings when the valleys were filled with delicate mists as if the spirit of autumn had poured them in for the sun to drain--amethyst, pearl, silver, rose, and smoke-blue.
<p/>The dews were so heavy that the fields glistened like cloth of silver and there were such heaps of rustling leaves in the hollows of many-stemmed woods to run crisply through. The Birch Path was a canopy of yellow and the ferns were sear and brown all along it. There was a tang in the very air that inspired the hearts of small maidens tripping, unlike snails, swiftly and willingly to school; and it was jolly to be back again at the little brown desk beside Diana, with Ruby Gillis nodding across the aisle and Carrie Sloane sending up notes and Julia Bell passing a <div class="bookquote">``chew''  (<font color='red'><b>Julia Bell/Julia</b></font>)</div>of gum down from the back seat. Anne drew a long breath of happiness as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sharpened her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) pencil and arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) picture cards in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) desk. Life was certainly very interesting. In the new teacher she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found another true and helpful friend. Miss Stacy was a bright, sympathetic young woman with the happy gift of winning and holding the affections of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) pupils and bringing out the best that was in them mentally and morally. Anne expanded like a flower under this wholesome influence and carried home to the admiring Matthew and the critical Marilla glowing accounts of schoolwork and aims. <div class="bookquote">``I love Miss Stacy with my whole heart, Marilla. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) is so ladylike and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) has such a sweet voice. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) pronounces my name I feel instinctively that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s spelling it with an E. We had recitations this afternoon. I just wish you could have been there to hear me recite `Mary, Queen of Scots.' I just put my whole soul into it.
<p/>Ruby Gillis told me coming home that the way I said the line, `Now for my father's arm,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) said, `my woman's heart farewell,' just made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) blood run cold.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well now, you might recite it for me some of these days, out in the barn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>suggested Matthew. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne meditatively, <div class="bookquote">``but I won't be able to do it so well , I know. It won't be so exciting as it is when you have a whole schoolful before you hanging breathlessly on your words. I know I won't be able to make your blood run cold.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Lynde says it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) blood run cold to see the boys climbing to the very tops of those big trees on Bell's hill after crows' nests last Friday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder at Miss Stacy for encouraging it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But we wanted a crow's nest for nature study,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>explained Anne. <div class="bookquote">``That was on our field afternoon. Field afternoons are splendid, Marilla. And Miss Stacy explains everything so beautifully. We have to write compositions on our field afternoons and I write the best ones.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's very vain of you to say so then. You'd better let your teacher say it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) did say it, Marilla. And indeed I'm not vain about it. How can I be, when I'm such a dunce at geometry? Although I'm really beginning to see through it a little, too. Miss Stacy makes it so clear. Still, I'll never be good at it and I assure you it is a humbling reflection. But I love writing compositions. Mostly Miss Stacy lets us choose our own subjects; but next week we are to write a composition on some remarkable person. It's hard to choose among so many remarkable people who have lived.
<p/>Mustn't it be splendid to be remarkable and have compositions written about you after you're dead? Oh, I would dearly love to be remarkable. I think when I grow up I'll be a trained nurse and go with the Red Crosses to the field of battle as a messenger of mercy. That is, if I don't go out as a foreign missionary. That would be very romantic, but one would have to be very good to be a missionary, and that would be a stumbling block. We have physical culture exercises every day, too. They make you graceful and promote digestion.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Promote fiddlesticks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, who honestly thought it was all nonsense. But all the field afternoons and recitation Fridays and physical culture contortions paled before a project which Miss Stacy brought forward in November. This was that the scholars of Avonlea school should get up a concert and hold it in the hall on Christmas Night, for the laudable purpose of helping to pay for a schoolhouse flag. The pupils one and all taking graciously to this plan, the preparations for a program were begun at once. And of all the excited performers-elect none was so excited as Anne Shirley, who threw herself into the undertaking heart and soul, hampered as she (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) was by Marilla's disapproval. Marilla thought it all rank foolishness. <div class="bookquote">``It's just filling your heads up with nonsense and taking time that ought to be put on your lessons,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) grumbled. <div class="bookquote">``I don't approve of children's getting up concerts and racing about to practices. It makes them vain and forward and fond of gadding.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But think of the worthy object,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>pleaded Anne. <div class="bookquote">``A flag will cultivate a spirit of patriotism, Marilla.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fudge! There's precious little patriotism in the thoughts of any of you.
<p/>All you want is a good time.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, when you can combine patriotism and fun, isn't it all right? Of course it's real nice to be getting up a concert. We're going to have six choruses and Diana is to sing a solo. I'm in two dialogues--`The Society for the Suppression of Gossip' and `The Fairy Queen.' The boys are going to have a dialogue too. And I'm to have two recitations, Marilla. I just tremble when I think of it, but it's a nice thrilly kind of tremble. And we're to have a tableau at the last--`Faith, Hope and Charity.' Diana and Ruby and I are to be in it, all draped in white with flowing hair. I'm to be Hope, with my hands clasped--so--and my eyes uplifted. I'm going to practice my recitations in the garret. Don't be alarmed if you hear me groaning. I have to groan heartrendingly in one of them, and it's really hard to get up a good artistic groan, Marilla. Josie Pye is sulky because she (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) didn't get the part she (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) wanted in the dialogue. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) wanted to be the fairy queen. That would have been ridiculous, for who ever heard of a fairy queen as fat as Josie? Fairy queens must be slender. Jane Andrews is to be the queen and I am to be one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) maids of honor. Josie says she (<font color='blue'><b>Josie</b></font>) thinks a red-haired fairy is just as ridiculous as a fat one, but I do not let myself mind what Josie says. I'm to have a wreath of white roses on my hair and Ruby Gillis is going to lend me her (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) slippers because I haven't any of my own. It's necessary for fairies to have slippers, you know. You couldn't imagine a fairy wearing boots, could you?
<p/>Especially with copper toes? We are going to decorate the hall with creeping spruce and fir mottoes with pink tissue-paper roses in them. And we are all to march in two by two after the audience is seated, while Emma White plays a march on the organ. Oh, Marilla, I know you are not so enthusiastic about it as I am, but don't you hope your little Anne will distinguish herself?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All I hope is that you'll behave yourself. I'll be heartily glad when all this fuss is over and you'll be able to settle down. You are simply good for nothing just now with your head stuffed full of dialogues and groans and tableaus. As for your tongue, it's a marvel it's not clean worn out. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne sighed and betook herself to the back yard, over which a young new moon was shining through the leafless poplar boughs from an apple-green western sky, and where Matthew was splitting wood. Anne perched herself on a block and talked the concert over with him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>), sure of an appreciative and sympathetic listener in this instance at least. '' Well now, I reckon it's going to be a pretty good concert. And I expect you'll do your part fine,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) said, smiling down into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eager, vivacious little face. Anne smiled back at him (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>). Those two were the best of friends and Matthew thanked his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) stars many a time and oft that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had nothing to do with bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) up. That was Marilla's exclusive duty; if it had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) would have been worried over frequent conflicts between inclination and said duty. As it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was free to, <div class="bookquote">``spoil Anne'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--Marilla's phrasing--as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) liked.
<p/>But it was not such a bad arrangement after all; a little <div class="bookquote">``appreciation''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sometimes does quite as much good as all the conscientious <div class="bookquote">``bringing up''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in the world. CHAPTER XXV. Matthew Insists on Puffed Sleeves |MATTHEW was having a bad ten minutes of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>MATTHEW</b></font>) had come into the kitchen, in the twilight of a cold, gray December evening, and had sat down in the woodbox corner to take off his (<font color='blue'><b>MATTHEW</b></font>) heavy boots, unconscious of the fact that Anne and a bevy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) schoolmates were having a practice of <div class="bookquote">``The Fairy Queen''  (<font color='red'><b>schoolmates</b></font>)</div>in the sitting room. Presently they came trooping through the hall and out into the kitchen, laughing and chattering gaily. They did not see Matthew, who shrank bashfully back into the shadows beyond the woodbox with a boot in one hand and a bootjack in the other, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) watched them shyly for the aforesaid ten minutes as they put on caps and jackets and talked about the dialogue and the concert. Anne stood among them, bright eyed and animated as they; but Matthew suddenly became conscious that there was something about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) different from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mates. And what worried Matthew was that the difference impressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) as being something that should not exist. Anne had a brighter face, and bigger, starrier eyes, and more delicate features than the other; even shy, unobservant Matthew had learned to take note of these things; but the difference that disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) did not consist in any of these respects. Then in what did it consist? Matthew was haunted by this question long after the girls had gone, arm in arm, down the long, hard-frozen lane and Anne had betaken herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) books.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) could not refer it to Marilla, who, he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) felt, would be quite sure to sniff scornfully and remark that the only difference she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) saw between Anne and the other girls was that they sometimes kept their tongues quiet while Anne never did. This, Matthew felt, would be no great help. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had recourse to his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) pipe that evening to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) study it out, much to Marilla's disgust. After two hours of smoking and hard reflection Matthew arrived at a solution of his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) problem. Anne was not dressed like the other girls! The more Matthew thought about the matter the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was convinced that Anne never had been dressed like the other girls--never since she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had come to Green Gables. Marilla kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) clothed in plain, dark dresses, all made after the same unvarying pattern. If Matthew knew there was such a thing as fashion in dress it was as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) did; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was quite sure that Anne's sleeves did not look at all like the sleeves the other girls wore. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) recalled the cluster of little girls he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had seen around her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) that evening--all gay in waists of red and blue and pink and white--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) wondered why Marilla always kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) so plainly and soberly gowned. Of course, it must be all right. Marilla knew best and Marilla was bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) up. Probably some wise, inscrutable motive was to be served thereby. But surely it would do no harm to let the child have one pretty dress--something like Diana Barry always wore. Matthew decided that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) one; that surely could not be objected to as an unwarranted putting in of his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) oar. Christmas was only a fortnight off. A nice new dress would be the very thing for a present.
<p/>Matthew, with a sigh of satisfaction, put away his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) pipe and went to bed, while Marilla opened all the doors and aired the house. The very next evening Matthew betook himself to Carmody to buy the dress, determined to get the worst over and have done with it. It would be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) felt assured, no trifling ordeal. There were some things Matthew could buy and prove himself no mean bargainer; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) would be at the mercy of shopkeepers when it came to buying a girl's dress. After much cogitation Matthew resolved to go to Samuel Lawson's store instead of William Blair's. To be sure, the Cuthberts always had gone to William Blair's; it was almost as much a matter of conscience with them as to attend the Presbyterian church and vote Conservative. But William Blair's two daughters frequently waited on customers there and Matthew held them in absolute dread. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) could contrive to deal with them when he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) knew exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) wanted and could point it out; but in such a matter as this, requiring explanation and consultation, Matthew felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) must be sure of a man behind the counter. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) would go to Lawson's, where Samuel or his (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>) son would wait on him (<font color='blue'><b>Samuel</b></font>). Alas! Matthew did not know that Samuel, in the recent expansion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) business, had set up a lady clerk also; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a niece of his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) wife's and a very dashing young person indeed, with a huge, drooping pompadour, big, rolling brown eyes, and a most extensive and bewildering smile. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was dressed with exceeding smartness and wore several bangle bracelets that glittered and rattled and tinkled with every movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Matthew was covered with confusion at finding her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) there at all; and those bangles completely wrecked his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) wits at one fell swoop. <div class="bookquote">``What can I do for you this evening, Mr. Cuthbert? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucilla</b></font>)</div>Miss Lucilla Harris inquired, briskly and ingratiatingly, tapping the counter with both hands. '' Have you any--any--any--well now, say any garden rakes? '' stammered Matthew. Miss Harris looked somewhat surprised, as well she (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) might, to hear a man inquiring for garden rakes in the middle of December. <div class="bookquote">``I believe we have one or two left over,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but they're upstairs in the lumber room. I'll go and see.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>During her (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) absence Matthew collected his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) scattered senses for another effort. When Miss Harris returned with the rake and cheerfully inquired: <div class="bookquote">``Anything else tonight, Mr. Cuthbert? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Harris</b></font>)</div>Matthew took his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) courage in both hands and replied: <div class="bookquote">``Well now, since you suggest it, I might as well--take--that is--look at--buy some--some hayseed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>Miss Harris had heard Matthew Cuthbert called odd. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) now concluded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) was entirely crazy. <div class="bookquote">``We only keep hayseed in the spring,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) explained loftily. <div class="bookquote">``We've none on hand just now.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, certainly--certainly--just as you say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>stammered unhappy Matthew, seizing the rake and making for the door. At the threshold he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) recollected that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had not paid for it and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) turned miserably back. While Miss Harris was counting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) change he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) rallied his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) powers for a final desperate attempt. '' Well now--if it isn't too much trouble--I might as well--that is-- I'd like to look at--at--some sugar.'' <div class="bookquote">``White or brown? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Harris</b></font>)</div>queried Miss Harris patiently. <div class="bookquote">``Oh--well now--brown,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew feebly. <div class="bookquote">``There's a barrel of it over there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Harris</b></font>)</div>said Miss Harris, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) bangles at it. <div class="bookquote">``It's the only kind we have.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll--I'll take twenty pounds of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew, with beads of perspiration standing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) forehead. Matthew had driven halfway home before he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) own man again. It had been a gruesome experience, but it served him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) right , he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) thought, for committing the heresy of going to a strange store. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) reached home he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) hid the rake in the tool house, but the sugar he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) carried in to Marilla. '' Brown sugar!'' exclaimed Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever possessed you to get so much? You know I never use it except for the hired man's porridge or black fruit cake. Jerry's gone and I've made my cake long ago. It's not good sugar, either--it's coarse and dark--William Blair doesn't usually keep sugar like that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I--I thought it might come in handy sometime,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew, making good his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) escape. When Matthew came to think the matter over he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) decided that a woman was required to cope with the situation. Marilla was out of the question. Matthew felt sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) would throw cold water on his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) project at once. Remained only Mrs. Lynde; for of no other woman in Avonlea would Matthew have dared to ask advice. To Mrs. Lynde he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) went accordingly, and that good lady promptly took the matter out of the harassed man's hands. '' Pick out a dress for you to give Anne? To be sure I will. I'm going to Carmody tomorrow and I'll attend to it. Have you something particular in mind? No? Well, I'll just go by my own judgment then. I believe a nice rich brown would just suit Anne, and William Blair has some new gloria in that's real pretty.
<p/>Perhaps you'd like me to make it up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), too, seeing that if Marilla was to make it Anne would probably get wind of it before the time and spoil the surprise? Well, I'll do it. No, it isn't a mite of trouble. I like sewing. I'll make it to fit my niece, Jenny Gillis, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) and Anne are as like as two peas as far as figure goes.'' <div class="bookquote">``Well now, I'm much obliged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew, <div class="bookquote">``and-- and--I dunno-- but I'd like-- I think they make the sleeves different nowadays to what they used to be. If it wouldn't be asking too much I--I'd like them made in the new way.''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Puffs? Of course. You needn't worry a speck more about it, Matthew. I'll make it up in the very latest fashion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lynde/Mrs. Rachel/Rachel</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Lynde. To herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) added when Matthew had gone: <div class="bookquote">``It'll be a real satisfaction to see that poor child wearing something decent for once. The way Marilla dresses her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) is positively ridiculous, that's what, and I've ached to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) so plainly a dozen times. I've held my tongue though, for I can see Marilla doesn't want advice and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) knows more about bringing children up than I do for all she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s an old maid. But that's always the way. Folks that has brought up children know that there's no hard and fast method in the world that'll suit every child. But them as never have think it's all as plain and easy as Rule of Three--just set your three terms down so fashion, and the sum 'll work out correct. But flesh and blood don't come under the head of arithmetic and that's where Marilla Cuthbert makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) mistake.
<p/>I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>)'s trying to cultivate a spirit of humility in Anne by dressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) does; but it's more likely to cultivate envy and discontent. I'm sure the child must feel the difference between her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) clothes and the other girls'. But to think of Matthew taking notice of it! That man is waking up after being asleep for over sixty years. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>Marilla knew all the following fortnight that Matthew had something on his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) mind, but what it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) could not guess, until Christmas Eve, when Mrs. Lynde brought up the new dress. Marilla behaved pretty well on the whole, although it is very likely she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) distrusted Mrs. Lynde's diplomatic explanation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had made the dress because Matthew was afraid Anne would find out about it too soon if Marilla made it. '' So this is what Matthew has been looking so mysterious over and grinning about to himself for two weeks, is it?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) said a little stiffly but tolerantly. <div class="bookquote">``I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was up to some foolishness. Well, I must say I don't think Anne needed any more dresses. I made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) three good, warm, serviceable ones this fall, and anything more is sheer extravagance. There's enough material in those sleeves alone to make a waist, I declare there is. You'll just pamper Anne's vanity, Matthew, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'s as vain as a peacock now. Well, I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'ll be satisfied at last, for I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'s been hankering after those silly sleeves ever since they came in, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) never said a word after the first. The puffs have been getting bigger and more ridiculous right along; they're as big as balloons now. Next year anybody who wears them will have to go through a door sideways.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Christmas morning broke on a beautiful white world. It had been a very mild December and people had looked forward to a green Christmas; but just enough snow fell softly in the night to transfigure Avonlea. Anne peeped out from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) frosted gable window with delighted eyes. The firs in the Haunted Wood were all feathery and wonderful; the birches and wild cherry trees were outlined in pearl; the plowed fields were stretches of snowy dimples; and there was a crisp tang in the air that was glorious. Anne ran downstairs singing until her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) voice reechoed through Green Gables. '' Merry Christmas, Marilla! Merry Christmas, Matthew! Isn't it a lovely Christmas? I'm so glad it's white. Any other kind of Christmas doesn't seem real, does it? I don't like green Christmases. They're not green--they're just nasty faded browns and grays. What makes people call them green? Why--why--Matthew, is that for me? Oh, Matthew! '' Matthew had sheepishly unfolded the dress from its paper swathings and held it out with a deprecatory glance at Marilla, who feigned to be contemptuously filling the teapot, but nevertheless watched the scene out of the corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) eye with a rather interested air. Anne took the dress and looked at it in reverent silence. Oh, how pretty it was--a lovely soft brown gloria with all the gloss of silk; a skirt with dainty frills and shirrings; a waist elaborately pintucked in the most fashionable way, with a little ruffle of filmy lace at the neck. But the sleeves--they were the crowning glory! Long elbow cuffs, and above them two beautiful puffs divided by rows of shirring and bows of brown-silk ribbon. <div class="bookquote">``That's a Christmas present for you, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew shyly. '' Why--why--Anne, don't you like it? Well now--well now.''
<p/>For Anne's eyes had suddenly filled with tears. '' Like it! Oh, Matthew! '' Anne laid the dress over a chair and clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands. '' Matthew, it's perfectly exquisite. Oh, I can never thank you enough. Look at those sleeves! Oh, it seems to me this must be a happy dream.'' <div class="bookquote">``Well, well, let us have breakfast,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>interrupted Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``I must say, Anne, I don't think you needed the dress; but since Matthew has got it for you, see that you take good care of it. There's a hair ribbon Mrs. Lynde left for you. It's brown, to match the dress. Come now, sit in.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't see how I'm going to eat breakfast,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne rapturously. '' Breakfast seems so commonplace at such an exciting moment. I'd rather feast my eyes on that dress. I'm so glad that puffed sleeves are still fashionable. It did seem to me that I'd never get over it if they went out before I had a dress with them. I'd never have felt quite satisfied, you see. It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde to give me the ribbon too. I feel that I ought to be a very good girl indeed. It's at times like this I'm sorry I'm not a model little girl; and I always resolve that I will be in future. But somehow it's hard to carry out your resolutions when irresistible temptations come. Still, I really will make an extra effort after this. '' When the commonplace breakfast was over Diana appeared, crossing the white log bridge in the hollow, a gay little figure in her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) crimson ulster. Anne flew down the slope to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). '' Merry Christmas, Diana! And oh, it's a wonderful Christmas. I've something splendid to show you.
<p/>Matthew has given me the loveliest dress, with such sleeves. I couldn't even imagine any nicer.'' <div class="bookquote">``I've got something more for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana breathlessly. '' Here--this box. Aunt Josephine sent us out a big box with ever so many things in it--and this is for you. I'd have brought it over last night, but it didn't come until after dark, and I never feel very comfortable coming through the Haunted Wood in the dark now.'' Anne opened the box and peeped in. First a card with <div class="bookquote">``For the Anne-girl and Merry Christmas,''  (<font color='red'><b>kid</b></font>)</div>written on it; and then, a pair of the daintiest little kid slippers, with beaded toes and satin bows and glistening buckles. '' Oh,'' said Anne, <div class="bookquote">``Diana, this is too much. I must be dreaming.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I call it providential,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana. <div class="bookquote">``You won't have to borrow Ruby's slippers now, and that's a blessing, for they're two sizes too big for you, and it would be awful to hear a fairy shuffling. Josie Pye would be delighted. Mind you, Rob Wright went home with Gertie Pye from the practice night before last. Did you ever hear anything equal to that? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Avonlea scholars</b></font>)</div>All the Avonlea scholars were in a fever of excitement that day, for the hall had to be decorated and a last grand rehearsal held. The concert came off in the evening and was a pronounced success. The little hall was crowded; all the performers did excellently well, but Anne was the bright particular star of the occasion, as even envy, in the shape of Josie Pye, dared not deny. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, hasn't it been a brilliant evening?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>sighed Anne, when it was all over and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and Diana were walking home together under a dark, starry sky. <div class="bookquote">``Everything went off very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana practically.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess we must have made as much as ten dollars. Mind you, Mr. Allan is going to send an account of it to the Charlottetown papers.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Diana, will we really see our names in print? It makes me thrill to think of it. Your solo was perfectly elegant, Diana. I felt prouder than you did when it was encored. I just said to myself, `It is my dear bosom friend who is so honored.'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, your recitations just brought down the house, Anne. That sad one was simply splendid.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I was so nervous, Diana. When Mr. Allan called out my name I really cannot tell how I ever got up on that platform. I felt as if a million eyes were looking at me and through me, and for one dreadful moment I was sure I couldn't begin at all. Then I thought of my lovely puffed sleeves and took courage. I knew that I must live up to those sleeves, Diana. So I started in, and my voice seemed to be coming from ever so far away. I just felt like a parrot. It's providential that I practiced those recitations so often up in the garret, or I'd never have been able to get through. Did I groan all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed, you groaned lovely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>assured Diana. <div class="bookquote">``I saw old Mrs. Sloane wiping away tears when I sat down.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wasn't the boys' dialogue fine?''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana. '' Gilbert Blythe was just splendid. Anne, I do think it's awful mean the way you treat Gil. Wait till I tell you.
<p/>When you ran off the platform after the fairy dialogue one of your roses fell out of your hair. I saw Gil pick it up and put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gil</b></font>) breast pocket. There now. You're so romantic that I'm sure you ought to be pleased at that.'' <div class="bookquote">``It's nothing to me what that person does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne loftily. <div class="bookquote">``I simply never waste a thought on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gil</b></font>), Diana.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>That night Marilla and Matthew, who had been out to a concert for the first time in twenty years, sat for a while by the kitchen fire after Anne had gone to bed. '' Well now, I guess our Anne did as well as any of them,'' said Matthew proudly. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>admitted Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s a bright child, Matthew. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) looked real nice too. I've been kind of opposed to this concert scheme, but I suppose there's no real harm in it after all. Anyhow, I was proud of Anne tonight, although I'm not going to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) so.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well now, I was proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and I did tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) so `fore she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went upstairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew. <div class="bookquote">``We must see what we can do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) some of these days, Marilla.

Though tonight it struck me she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) was growing quite a big girl. Mrs. Lynde made that dress a mite too long, and it makes Anne look so tall. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'s quick to learn and I guess the best thing we can do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) will be to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to Queen's after a spell. But nothing need be said about that for a year or two yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well now, it'll do no harm to be thinking it over off and on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew. <div class="bookquote">``Things like that are all the better for lots of thinking over.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXVI. The Story Club Is Formed |JUNIOR Avonlea found it hard to settle down to humdrum existence again. To Anne in particular things seemed fearfully flat, stale, and unprofitable after the goblet of excitement she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been sipping for weeks. Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) go back to the former quiet pleasures of those faraway days before the concert? At first, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) told Diana, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not really think she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could. <div class="bookquote">``I'm positively certain, Diana, that life can never be quite the same again as it was in those olden days,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) said mournfully, as if referring to a period of at least fifty years back. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps after a while I'll get used to it, but I'm afraid concerts spoil people for everyday life. I suppose that is why Marilla disapproves of them. Marilla is such a sensible woman. It must be a great deal better to be sensible; but still, I don't believe I'd really want to be a sensible person, because they are so unromantic. Mrs. Lynde says there is no danger of my ever being one, but you can never tell. I feel just now that I may grow up to be sensible yet. But perhaps that is only because I'm tired. I simply couldn't sleep last night for ever so long. I just lay awake and imagined the concert over and over again. That's one splendid thing about such affairs--it's so lovely to look back to them.''  (<font color='red'><b>Avonlea</b></font>)</div>Eventually, however, Avonlea school slipped back into its old groove and took up its old interests. To be sure, the concert left traces.
<p/>Ruby Gillis and Emma White, who had quarreled over a point of precedence in their platform seats, no longer sat at the same desk, and a promising friendship of three years was broken up. Josie Pye and Julia Bell did not <div class="bookquote">``speak''  (<font color='red'><b>Julia Bell/Julia</b></font>)</div>for three months, because Josie Pye had told Bessie Wright that Julia Bell's bow when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) got up to recite made her (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) think of a chicken jerking its head, and Bessie told Julia. None of the Sloanes would have any dealings with the Bells, because the Bells had declared that the Sloanes had too much to do in the program, and the Sloanes had retorted that the Bells were not capable of doing the little they had to do properly. Finally, Charlie Sloane fought Moody Spurgeon MacPherson, because Moody Spurgeon had said that Anne Shirley put on airs about her (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) recitations, and Moody Spurgeon was <div class="bookquote">``licked'' (<font color='red'><b>Moody Spurgeon/Moody Spurgeon MacPherson</b></font>)</div>; consequently Moody Spurgeon's sister, Ella May, would not <div class="bookquote">``speak''  (<font color='red'><b>Ella</b></font>)</div>to Anne Shirley all the rest of the winter. With the exception of these trifling frictions, work in Miss Stacy's little kingdom went on with regularity and smoothness. The winter weeks slipped by. It was an unusually mild winter, with so little snow that Anne and Diana could go to school nearly every day by way of the Birch Path. On Anne's birthday they were tripping lightly down it, keeping eyes and ears alert amid all their chatter, for Miss Stacy had told them that they must soon write a composition on <div class="bookquote">``A Winter's Walk in the Woods,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Stacy/Stacy</b></font>)</div>and it behooved them to be observant. '' Just think, Diana, I'm thirteen years old today,'' remarked Anne in an awed voice. <div class="bookquote">``I can scarcely realize that I'm in my teens. When I woke this morning it seemed to me that everything must be different.
<p/>You've been thirteen for a month, so I suppose it doesn't seem such a novelty to you as it does to me. It makes life seem so much more interesting. In two more years I'll be really grown up. It's a great comfort to think that I'll be able to use big words then without being laughed at.''

But I'm afraid that is an uncharitable speech. Mrs. Allan says we should never make uncharitable speeches; but they do slip out so often before you think, don't they? I simply can't talk about Josie Pye without making an uncharitable speech, so I never mention her (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) at all. You may have noticed that. I'm trying to be as much like Mrs. Allan as I possibly can, for I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)'s perfect. Mr. Allan thinks so too. Mrs. Lynde says he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) just worships the ground she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) treads on and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) doesn't really think it right for a minister to set his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) affections so much on a mortal being. But then, Diana, even ministers are human and have their besetting sins just like everybody else. I had such an interesting talk with Mrs. Allan about besetting sins last Sunday afternoon. There are just a few things it's proper to talk about on Sundays and that is one of them. My besetting sin is imagining too much and forgetting my duties. I'm striving very hard to overcome it and now that I'm really thirteen perhaps I'll get on better.''

That's something to remember for our woods composition. I really think the woods are just as lovely in winter as in summer.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's as easy as wink,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``It's easy for you because you have an imagination,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>retorted Diana, <div class="bookquote">``but what would you do if you had been born without one? I suppose you have your composition all done?''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>Anne nodded, trying hard not to look virtuously complacent and failing miserably. <div class="bookquote">``I wrote it last Monday evening. It's called `The Jealous Rival; or In Death Not Divided.' I read it to Marilla and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) said it was stuff and nonsense. Then I read it to Matthew and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) said it was fine. That is the kind of critic I like. It's a sad, sweet story.
<p/>I just cried like a child while I was writing it. It's about two beautiful maidens called Cordelia Montmorency and Geraldine Seymour who lived in the same village and were devotedly attached to each other. Cordelia was a regal brunette with a coronet of midnight hair and duskly flashing eyes. Geraldine was a queenly blonde with hair like spun gold and velvety purple eyes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I never saw anybody with purple eyes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana dubiously. '' Neither did I. I just imagined them. I wanted something out of the common. Geraldine had an alabaster brow too. I've found out what an alabaster brow is. That is one of the advantages of being thirteen. You know so much more than you did when you were only twelve.'' <div class="bookquote">``Well, what became of Cordelia and Geraldine?''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>asked Diana, who was beginning to feel rather interested in their fate. <div class="bookquote">``They grew in beauty side by side until they were sixteen. Then Bertram DeVere came to their native village and fell in love with the fair Geraldine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Geraldine</b></font>) life when her (<font color='blue'><b>Geraldine</b></font>) horse ran away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Geraldine</b></font>) in a carriage, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Geraldine</b></font>) fainted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) arms and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Geraldine</b></font>) home three miles; because, you understand, the carriage was all smashed up. I found it rather hard to imagine the proposal because I had no experience to go by. I asked Ruby Gillis if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) knew anything about how men proposed because I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>)'d likely be an authority on the subject, having so many sisters married. Ruby told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was hid in the hall pantry when Malcolm Andres proposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) sister Susan.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) said Malcolm told Susan that his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) dad had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) the farm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) own name and then said, `What do you say, darling pet, if we get hitched this fall?' And Susan said, `Yes--no--I don't know--let me see'--and there they were, engaged as quick as that. But I didn't think that sort of a proposal was a very romantic one, so in the end I had to imagine it out as well as I could. I made it very flowery and poetical and Bertram went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) knees, although Ruby Gillis says it isn't done nowadays. Geraldine accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) in a speech a page long. I can tell you I took a lot of trouble with that speech. I rewrote it five times and I look upon it as my masterpiece. Bertram gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Geraldine</b></font>) a diamond ring and a ruby necklace and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Geraldine</b></font>) they would go to Europe for a wedding tour, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was immensely wealthy. But then, alas, shadows began to darken over their path. Cordelia was secretly in love with Bertram herself and when Geraldine told her (<font color='blue'><b>Geraldine</b></font>) about the engagement she (<font color='blue'><b>Geraldine</b></font>) was simply furious, especially when she (<font color='blue'><b>Geraldine</b></font>) saw the necklace and the diamond ring. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Geraldine</b></font>) affection for Geraldine turned to bitter hate and she (<font color='blue'><b>Geraldine</b></font>) vowed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Geraldine</b></font>) should never marry Bertram. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Geraldine</b></font>) pretended to be Geraldine's friend the same as ever. One evening they were standing on the bridge over a rushing turbulent stream and Cordelia, thinking they were alone, pushed Geraldine over the brink with a wild, mocking, `Ha, ha, ha.' But Bertram saw it all and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) at once plunged into the current, exclaiming, 'I will save thee, my peerless Geraldine.' But alas, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had forgotten he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) couldn't swim, and they were both drowned, clasped in each other's arms.
<p/>Their bodies were washed ashore soon afterwards. They were buried in the one grave and their funeral was most imposing, Diana. It's so much more romantic to end a story up with a funeral than a wedding. As for Cordelia, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cordelia</b></font>) went insane with remorse and was shut up in a lunatic asylum. I thought that was a poetical retribution for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cordelia</b></font>) crime.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How perfectly lovely!''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>sighed Diana, who belonged to Matthew's school of critics. <div class="bookquote">``I don't see how you can make up such thrilling things out of your own head, Anne. I wish my imagination was as good as yours.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It would be if you'd only cultivate it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne cheeringly. <div class="bookquote">``I've just thought of a plan, Diana. Let you and me have a story club all our own and write stories for practice. I'll help you along until you can do them by yourself. You ought to cultivate your imagination, you know. Miss Stacy says so. Only we must take the right way. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) about the Haunted Wood, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) said we went the wrong way about it in that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This was how the story club came into existence. It was limited to Diana and Anne at first, but soon it was extended to include Jane Andrews and Ruby Gillis and one or two others who felt that their imaginations needed cultivating. No boys were allowed in it--although Ruby Gillis opined that their admission would make it more exciting--and each member had to produce one story a week. <div class="bookquote">``It's extremely interesting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne told Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``Each girl has to read her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) story out loud and then we talk it over. We are going to keep them all sacredly and have them to read to our descendants. We each write under a nom-de-plume. Mine is Rosamond Montmorency.
<p/>All the girls do pretty well. Ruby Gillis is rather sentimental. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) puts too much lovemaking into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) stories and you know too much is worse than too little. Jane never puts any because she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) says it makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) feel so silly when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had to read it out loud. Jane's stories are extremely sensible. Then Diana puts too many murders into hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) says most of the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) doesn't know what to do with the people so she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) kills them off to get rid of them. I mostly always have to tell them what to write about, but that isn't hard for I've millions of ideas.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think this story-writing business is the foolishest yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>scoffed Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``You'll get a pack of nonsense into your heads and waste time that should be put on your lessons. Reading stories is bad enough but writing them is worse.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But we're so careful to put a moral into them all, Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>explained Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I insist upon that. All the good people are rewarded and all the bad ones are suitably punished. I'm sure that must have a wholesome effect. The moral is the great thing. Mr. Allan says so. I read one of my stories to him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) and Mrs. Allan and they both agreed that the moral was excellent. Only they laughed in the wrong places. I like it better when people cry. Jane and Ruby almost always cry when I come to the pathetic parts. Diana wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) Aunt Josephine about our club and her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) Aunt Josephine wrote back that we were to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) some of our stories. So we copied out four of our very best and sent them. Miss Josephine Barry wrote back that she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) had never read anything so amusing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) life.
<p/>That kind of puzzled us because the stories were all very pathetic and almost everybody died. But I'm glad Miss Barry liked them. It shows our club is doing some good in the world. Mrs. Allan says that ought to be our object in everything. I do really try to make it my object but I forget so often when I'm having fun. I hope I shall be a little like Mrs. Allan when I grow up. Do you think there is any prospect of it, Marilla?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't say there was a great deal ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>was Marilla's encouraging answer. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure Mrs. Allan was never such a silly, forgetful little girl as you are.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) wasn't always so good as she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) is now either,'' said Anne seriously. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) told me so herself--that is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was a dreadful mischief when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was a girl and was always getting into scrapes. I felt so encouraged when I heard that. Is it very wicked of me, Marilla, to feel encouraged when I hear that other people have been bad and mischievous? Mrs. Lynde says it is. Mrs. Lynde says she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) always feels shocked when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) hears of anyone ever having been naughty, no matter how small they were. Mrs. Lynde says she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) once heard a minister confess that when he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) was a boy he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) stole a strawberry tart out of his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) aunt's pantry and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) never had any respect for that minister again. Now, I wouldn't have felt that way.
<p/>I'd have thought that it was real noble of him (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) to confess it, and I'd have thought what an encouraging thing it would be for small boys nowadays who do naughty things and are sorry for them to know that perhaps they may grow up to be ministers in spite of it. That's how I'd feel, Marilla.'' <div class="bookquote">``The way I feel at present, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, <div class="bookquote">``is that it's high time you had those dishes washed. You've taken half an hour longer than you should with all your chattering. Learn to work first and talk afterwards.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXVII. Vanity and Vexation of Spirit Marilla, walking home one late April evening from an Aid meeting, realized that the winter was over and gone with the thrill of delight that spring never fails to bring to the oldest and saddest as well as to the youngest and merriest. Marilla was not given to subjective analysis of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) thoughts and feelings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) probably imagined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) was thinking about the Aids and their missionary box and the new carpet for the vestry room, but under these reflections was a harmonious consciousness of red fields smoking into pale-purply mists in the declining sun, of long, sharp-pointed fir shadows falling over the meadow beyond the brook, of still, crimson-budded maples around a mirrorlike wood pool, of a wakening in the world and a stir of hidden pulses under the gray sod. The spring was abroad in the land and Marilla's sober, middle-aged step was lighter and swifter because of its deep, primal gladness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) eyes dwelt affectionately on Green Gables, peering through its network of trees and reflecting the sunlight back from its windows in several little coruscations of glory.
<p/>Marilla, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) picked her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) steps along the damp lane, thought that it was really a satisfaction to know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) was going home to a briskly snapping wood fire and a table nicely spread for tea, instead of to the cold comfort of old Aid meeting evenings before Anne had come to Green Gables. Consequently, when Marilla entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) kitchen and found the fire black out, with no sign of Anne anywhere, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt justly disappointed and irritated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had told Anne to be sure and have tea ready at five o'clock, but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must hurry to take off her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) second-best dress and prepare the meal herself against Matthew's return from plowing. <div class="bookquote">``I'll settle Miss Anne when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) comes home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla grimly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) shaved up kindlings with a carving knife and with more vim than was strictly necessary. Matthew had come in and was waiting patiently for his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) tea in his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) corner. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s gadding off somewhere with Diana, writing stories or practicing dialogues or some such tomfoolery, and never thinking once about the time or her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) duties. She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>)'s just got to be pulled up short and sudden on this sort of thing. I don't care if Mrs. Allan does say she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>)'s the brightest and sweetest child she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) ever knew. She (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) may be bright and sweet enough, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) head is full of nonsense and there's never any knowing what shape it'll break out in next. Just as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) grows out of one freak she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) takes up with another. But there! Here I am saying the very thing I was so riled with Rachel Lynde for saying at the Aid today. I was real glad when Mrs. Allan spoke up for Anne, for if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hadn't I know
<p/>I'd have said something too sharp to Rachel before everybody. Anne's got plenty of faults, goodness knows, and far be it from me to deny it. But I'm bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) up and not Rachel Lynde, who'd pick faults in the Angel Gabriel himself if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) lived in Avonlea. Just the same, Anne has no business to leave the house like this when I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was to stay home this afternoon and look after things. I must say, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) faults, I never found her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) disobedient or untrustworthy before and I'm real sorry to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) so now.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well now, I dunno,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew, who, being patient and wise and, above all, hungry, had deemed it best to let Marilla talk her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) wrath out unhindered, having learned by experience that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) got through with whatever work was on hand much quicker if not delayed by untimely argument. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you're judging her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) too hasty, Marilla. Don't call her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) untrustworthy until you're sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) has disobeyed you. Mebbe it can all be explained--Anne's a great hand at explaining.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'s not here when I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>retorted Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``I reckon she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'ll find it hard to explain that to my satisfaction. Of course I knew you'd take her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) part, Matthew. But I'm bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) up, not you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>It was dark when supper was ready, and still no sign of Anne, coming hurriedly over the log bridge or up Lover's Lane, breathless and repentant with a sense of neglected duties. Marilla washed and put away the dishes grimly. Then, wanting a candle to light her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) way down the cellar, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) went up to the east gable for the one that generally stood on Anne's table.
<p/>Lighting it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) turned around to see Anne herself lying on the bed, face downward among the pillows. <div class="bookquote">``Mercy on us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said astonished Marilla, <div class="bookquote">``have you been asleep, Anne?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the muffled reply. <div class="bookquote">``Are you sick then? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>demanded Marilla anxiously, going over to the bed. Anne cowered deeper into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) pillows as if desirous of hiding herself forever from mortal eyes. '' No. But please, Marilla, go away and don't look at me. I'm in the depths of despair and I don't care who gets head in class or writes the best composition or sings in the Sunday-school choir any more. Little things like that are of no importance now because I don't suppose I'll ever be able to go anywhere again. My career is closed. Please, Marilla, go away and don't look at me.'' <div class="bookquote">``Did anyone ever hear the like?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>the mystified Marilla wanted to know. '' Anne Shirley, whatever is the matter with you? What have you done? Get right up this minute and tell me. This minute, I say. There now, what is it?'' Anne had slid to the floor in despairing obedience. <div class="bookquote">``Look at my hair, Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) whispered. Accordingly, Marilla lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) candle and looked scrutinizingly at Anne's hair, flowing in heavy masses down her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) back. It certainly had a very strange appearance. '' Anne Shirley, what have you done to your hair? Why, it's green! '' Green it might be called, if it were any earthly color--a queer, dull, bronzy green, with streaks here and there of the original red to heighten the ghastly effect. Never in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) life had Marilla seen anything so grotesque as Anne's hair at that moment. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's green,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>moaned Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I thought nothing could be as bad as red hair.
<p/>But now I know it's ten times worse to have green hair. Oh, Marilla, you little know how utterly wretched I am.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I little know how you got into this fix, but I mean to find out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``Come right down to the kitchen--it's too cold up here--and tell me just what you've done. I've been expecting something queer for some time. You haven't got into any scrape for over two months, and I was sure another one was due. Now, then, what did you do to your hair?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dyed it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dyed it! Dyed your hair!

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I knew it was a little wicked,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>admitted Anne. <div class="bookquote">``But I thought it was worth while to be a little wicked to get rid of red hair. I counted the cost, Marilla. Besides, I meant to be extra good in other ways to make up for it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla sarcastically, <div class="bookquote">``if I'd decided it was worth while to dye my hair I'd have dyed it a decent color at least. I wouldn't have dyed it green.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I didn't mean to dye it green, Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>protested Anne dejectedly. <div class="bookquote">``If I was wicked I meant to be wicked to some purpose.

How could I doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) word, Marilla? I know what it feels like to have your word doubted. And Mrs. Allan says we should never suspect anyone of not telling us the truth unless we have proof that they're not. I have proof now--green hair is proof enough for anybody. But I hadn't then and I believed every word he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said implicitly .''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who said? Who are you talking about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The peddler that was here this afternoon. I bought the dye from him (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Anne Shirley, how often have I told you never to let one of those Italians in the house! I don't believe in encouraging them to come around at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I didn't let him (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) in the house. I remembered what you told me, and I went out, carefully shut the door, and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) things on the step. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) wasn't an Italian--he (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) was a German Jew. He (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) had a big box full of very interesting things and he (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) told me he (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) was working hard to make enough money to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) wife and children out from Germany. He (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) spoke so feelingly about them that it touched my heart. I wanted to buy something from him (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) to help him (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) in such a worthy object. Then all at once I saw the bottle of hair dye. The peddler said it was warranted to dye any hair a beautiful raven black and wouldn't wash off. In a trice I saw myself with beautiful raven-black hair and the temptation was irresistible. But the price of the bottle was seventy-five cents and I had only fifty cents left out of my chicken money. I think the peddler had a very kind heart, for he (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) said that, seeing it was me, he (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>)'d sell it for fifty cents and that was just giving it away. So I bought it, and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) had gone I came up here and applied it with an old hairbrush as the directions said. I used up the whole bottle, and oh, Marilla, when I saw the dreadful color it turned my hair I repented of being wicked, I can tell you. And I've been repenting ever since.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I hope you'll repent to good purpose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla severely, <div class="bookquote">``and that you've got your eyes opened to where your vanity has led you, Anne. Goodness knows what's to be done. I suppose the first thing is to give your hair a good washing and see if that will do any good.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Accordingly, Anne washed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hair, scrubbing it vigorously with soap and water, but for all the difference it made she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might as well have been scouring its original red. The peddler had certainly spoken the truth when he (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) declared that the dye wouldn't wash off, however his (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) veracity might be impeached in other respects. '' Oh, Marilla, what shall I do? '' questioned Anne in tears. <div class="bookquote">``I can never live this down. People have pretty well forgotten my other mistakes--the liniment cake and setting Diana drunk and flying into a temper with Mrs. Lynde. But they'll never forget this.

Marilla, I cannot face Josie Pye. I am the unhappiest girl in Prince Edward Island. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne's unhappiness continued for a week. During that time she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went nowhere and shampooed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hair every day. Diana alone of outsiders knew the fatal secret, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) promised solemnly never to tell, and it may be stated here and now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) word. At the end of the week Marilla said decidedly: <div class="bookquote">``It's no use, Anne. That is fast dye if ever there was any. Your hair must be cut off; there is no other way. You can't go out with it looking like that. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne's lips quivered, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) realized the bitter truth of Marilla's remarks. With a dismal sigh she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) went for the scissors. <div class="bookquote">``Please cut it off at once, Marilla, and have it over. Oh, I feel that my heart is broken. This is such an unromantic affliction. The girls in books lose their hair in fevers or sell it to get money for some good deed, and I'm sure I wouldn't mind losing my hair in some such fashion half so much. But there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because you've dyed it a dreadful color, is there? I'm going to weep all the time you're cutting it off, if it won't interfere. It seems such a tragic thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne wept then, but later on, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went upstairs and looked in the glass, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was calm with despair. Marilla had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) work thoroughly and it had been necessary to shingle the hair as closely as possible. The result was not becoming, to state the case as mildly as may be. Anne promptly turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) glass to the wall. <div class="bookquote">``I'll never, never look at myself again until my hair grows,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) exclaimed passionately. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) suddenly righted the glass. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I will, too. I'd do penance for being wicked that way. I'll look at myself every time I come to my room and see how ugly I am. And I won't try to imagine it away, either. I never thought I was vain about my hair, of all things, but now I know I was, in spite of its being red, because it was so long and thick and curly. I expect something will happen to my nose next. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne's clipped head made a sensation in school on the following Monday, but to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) relief nobody guessed the real reason for it, not even Josie Pye, who, however, did not fail to inform Anne that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) looked like a perfect scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't say anything when Josie said that to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne confided that evening to Marilla, who was lying on the sofa after one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) headaches, <div class="bookquote">``because I thought it was part of my punishment and I ought to bear it patiently. It's hard to be told you look like a scarecrow and I wanted to say something back. But I didn't. I just swept her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) one scornful look and then I forgave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). It makes you feel very virtuous when you forgive people, doesn't it? I mean to devote all my energies to being good after this and I shall never try to be beautiful again. Of course it's better to be good. I know it is, but it's sometimes so hard to believe a thing even when you know it. I do really want to be good, Marilla, like you and Mrs. Allan and Miss Stacy, and grow up to be a credit to you. Diana says when my hair begins to grow to tie a black velvet ribbon around my head with a bow at one side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) thinks it will be very becoming. I will call it a snood-- that sounds so romantic. But am I talking too much, Marilla? Does it hurt your head?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My head is better now. It was terrible bad this afternoon, though. These headaches of mine are getting worse and worse. I'll have to see a doctor about them. As for your chatter, I don't know that I mind it--I've got so used to it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div><p/>Which was Marilla's way of saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) liked to hear it. CHAPTER XXVIII. An Unfortunate Lily Maid |OF course you must be Elaine, Anne,'' said Diana. <div class="bookquote">``I could never have the courage to float down there.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nor I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby Gillis/Ruby/Gillis</b></font>)</div>said Ruby Gillis, with a shiver. <div class="bookquote">``I don't mind floating down when there's two or three of us in the flat and we can sit up. It's fun then. But to lie down and pretend I was dead--I just couldn't. I'd die really of fright.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course it would be romantic,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Andrews</b></font>)</div>conceded Jane Andrews, '' but I know I couldn't keep still. I'd be popping up every minute or so to see where I was and if I wasn't drifting too far out. And you know, Anne, that would spoil the effect.'' <div class="bookquote">``But it's so ridiculous to have a redheaded Elaine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>mourned Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not afraid to float down and I'd love to be Elaine. But it's ridiculous just the same. Ruby ought to be Elaine because she (<font color='blue'><b>Elaine</b></font>) is so fair and has such lovely long golden hair--Elaine had `all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elaine</b></font>) bright hair streaming down,' you know. And Elaine was the lily maid. Now, a red-haired person cannot be a lily maid.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your complexion is just as fair as Ruby's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana earnestly, <div class="bookquote">``and your hair is ever so much darker than it used to be before you cut it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, do you really think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Anne, flushing sensitively with delight. <div class="bookquote">``I've sometimes thought it was myself--but I never dared to ask anyone for fear she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would tell me it wasn't. Do you think it could be called auburn now, Diana?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Yes, and I think it is real pretty,'' said Diana, looking admiringly at the short, silky curls that clustered over Anne's head and were held in place by a very jaunty black velvet ribbon and bow. They were standing on the bank of the pond, below Orchard Slope, where a little headland fringed with birches ran out from the bank; at its tip was a small wooden platform built out into the water for the convenience of fishermen and duck hunters. Ruby and Jane were spending the midsummer afternoon with Diana, and Anne had come over to play with them. Anne and Diana had spent most of their playtime that summer on and about the pond. Idlewild was a thing of the past, Mr. Bell having ruthlessly cut down the little circle of trees in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) back pasture in the spring. Anne had sat among the stumps and wept, not without an eye to the romance of it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was speedily consoled, for, after all, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and Diana said, big girls of thirteen, going on fourteen, were too old for such childish amusements as playhouses, and there were more fascinating sports to be found about the pond. It was splendid to fish for trout over the bridge and the two girls learned to row themselves about in the little flat-bottomed dory Mr. Barry kept for duck shooting. It was Anne's idea that they dramatize Elaine. They had studied Tennyson's poem in school the preceding winter, the Superintendent of Education having prescribed it in the English course for the Prince Edward Island schools.
<p/>They had analyzed and parsed it and torn it to pieces in general until it was a wonder there was any meaning at all left in it for them, but at least the fair lily maid and Lancelot and Guinevere and King Arthur had become very real people to them, and Anne was devoured by secret regret that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had not been born in Camelot. Those days, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, were so much more romantic than the present. Anne's plan was hailed with enthusiasm. The girls had discovered that if the flat were pushed off from the landing place it would drift down with the current under the bridge and finally strand itself on another headland lower down which ran out at a curve in the pond. They had often gone down like this and nothing could be more convenient for playing Elaine. '' Well, I'll be Elaine,'' said Anne, yielding reluctantly, for, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would have been delighted to play the principal character, yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) artistic sense demanded fitness for it and this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) limitations made impossible. <div class="bookquote">``Ruby, you must be King Arthur and Jane will be Guinevere and Diana must be Lancelot. But first you must be the brothers and the father. We can't have the old dumb servitor because there isn't room for two in the flat when one is lying down. We must pall the barge all its length in blackest samite. That old black shawl of your mother's will be just the thing, Diana. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>The black shawl having been procured, Anne spread it over the flat and then lay down on the bottom, with closed eyes and hands folded over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) breast.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) does look really dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby Gillis/Ruby/Gillis</b></font>)</div>whispered Ruby Gillis nervously, watching the still, white little face under the flickering shadows of the birches. <div class="bookquote">``It makes me feel frightened, girls. Do you suppose it's really right to act like this? Mrs. Lynde says that all play-acting is abominably wicked.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ruby, you shouldn't talk about Mrs. Lynde,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne severely. '' It spoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before Mrs. Lynde was born. Jane, you arrange this. It's silly for Elaine to be talking when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elaine</b></font>)'s dead. '' Jane rose to the occasion. Cloth of gold for coverlet there was none, but an old piano scarf of yellow Japanese crepe was an excellent substitute. A white lily was not obtainable just then, but the effect of a tall blue iris placed in one of Anne's folded hands was all that could be desired. '' Now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'s all ready,'' said Jane. <div class="bookquote">``We must kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) quiet brows and, Diana, you say, `Sister, farewell forever,' and Ruby, you say, `Farewell, sweet sister,' both of you as sorrowfully as you possibly can. Anne, for goodness sake smile a little. You know Elaine `lay as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elaine</b></font>) smiled.' That's better. Now push the flat off. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The flat was accordingly pushed off, scraping roughly over an old embedded stake in the process. Diana and Jane and Ruby only waited long enough to see it caught in the current and headed for the bridge before scampering up through the woods, across the road, and down to the lower headland where, as Lancelot and Guinevere and the King, they were to be in readiness to receive the lily maid. For a few minutes Anne, drifting slowly down, enjoyed the romance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) situation to the full. Then something happened not at all romantic.
<p/>The flat began to leak. In a very few moments it was necessary for Elaine to scramble to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elaine</b></font>) feet, pick up her (<font color='blue'><b>Elaine</b></font>) cloth of gold coverlet and pall of blackest samite and gaze blankly at a big crack in the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elaine</b></font>) barge through which the water was literally pouring. That sharp stake at the landing had torn off the strip of batting nailed on the flat. Anne did not know this, but it did not take her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) long to realize that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was in a dangerous plight. At this rate the flat would fill and sink long before it could drift to the lower headland. Where were the oars? Left behind at the landing! Anne gave one gasping little scream which nobody ever heard; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was white to the lips, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) self-possession. There was one chance--just one. <div class="bookquote">``I was horribly frightened,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) told Mrs. Allan the next day, <div class="bookquote">``and it seemed like years while the flat was drifting down to the bridge and the water rising in it every moment. I prayed, Mrs. Allan, most earnestly, but I didn't shut my eyes to pray, for I knew the only way God could save me was to let the flat float close enough to one of the bridge piles for me to climb up on it. You know the piles are just old tree trunks and there are lots of knots and old branch stubs on them. It was proper to pray, but I had to do my part by watching out and right well I knew it. I just said, `Dear God, please take the flat close to a pile and I'll do the rest,' over and over again. Under such circumstances you don't think much about making a flowery prayer.
<p/>But mine was answered, for the flat bumped right into a pile for a minute and I flung the scarf and the shawl over my shoulder and scrambled up on a big providential stub. And there I was, Mrs. Allan, clinging to that slippery old pile with no way of getting up or down. It was a very unromantic position, but I didn't think about that at the time. You don't think much about romance when you have just escaped from a watery grave. I said a grateful prayer at once and then I gave all my attention to holding on tight, for I knew I should probably have to depend on human aid to get back to dry land. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allan</b></font>)</div>The flat drifted under the bridge and then promptly sank in midstream. Ruby, Jane, and Diana, already awaiting it on the lower headland, saw it disappear before their very eyes and had not a doubt but that Anne had gone down with it. For a moment they stood still, white as sheets, frozen with horror at the tragedy; then, shrieking at the tops of their voices, they started on a frantic run up through the woods, never pausing as they crossed the main road to glance the way of the bridge. Anne, clinging desperately to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) precarious foothold, saw their flying forms and heard their shrieks. Help would soon come, but meanwhile her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) position was a very uncomfortable one. The minutes passed by, each seeming an hour to the unfortunate lily maid. Why didn't somebody come? Where had the girls gone? Suppose they had fainted, one and all! Suppose nobody ever came! Suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) grew so tired and cramped that she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) could hold on no longer!
<p/>Anne looked at the wicked green depths below her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), wavering with long, oily shadows, and shivered. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) imagination began to suggest all manner of gruesome possibilities to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Then, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) really could not endure the ache in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) arms and wrists another moment, Gilbert Blythe came rowing under the bridge in Harmon Andrews's dory! Gilbert glanced up and, much to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) amazement, beheld a little white scornful face looking down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) with big, frightened but also scornful gray eyes. '' Anne Shirley! How on earth did you get there?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) exclaimed. Without waiting for an answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) pulled close to the pile and extended his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) hand. There was no help for it; Anne, clinging to Gilbert Blythe's hand, scrambled down into the dory, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sat, drabbled and furious, in the stern with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) arms full of dripping shawl and wet crepe. It was certainly extremely difficult to be dignified under the circumstances! '' What has happened, Anne? '' asked Gilbert, taking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) oars. <div class="bookquote">``We were playing Elaine''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>explained Anne frigidly, without even looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) rescuer, <div class="bookquote">``and I had to drift down to Camelot in the barge--I mean the flat. The flat began to leak and I climbed out on the pile. The girls went for help. Will you be kind enough to row me to the landing? ''  (<font color='red'><b>rescuer</b></font>)</div>Gilbert obligingly rowed to the landing and Anne, disdaining assistance, sprang nimbly on shore. <div class="bookquote">``I'm very much obliged to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said haughtily as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) turned away. But Gilbert had also sprung from the boat and now laid a detaining hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) arm. '' Anne,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) said hurriedly, <div class="bookquote">``look here. Can't we be good friends? I'm awfully sorry I made fun of your hair that time. I didn't mean to vex you
<p/>and I only meant it for a joke. Besides, it's so long ago. I think your hair is awfully pretty now--honest I do. Let's be friends.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>For a moment Anne hesitated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had an odd, newly awakened consciousness under all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) outraged dignity that the half-shy, half-eager expression in Gilbert's hazel eyes was something that was very good to see. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart gave a quick, queer little beat. But the bitterness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) old grievance promptly stiffened up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wavering determination. That scene of two years before flashed back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) recollection as vividly as if it had taken place yesterday. Gilbert had called her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``carrots''  (<font color='red'><b>Gilbert/Gilbert Blythe/Blythe</b></font>)</div>and had brought about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) disgrace before the whole school. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) resentment, which to other and older people might be as laughable as its cause, was in no whit allayed and softened by time seemingly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hated Gilbert Blythe! She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would never forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>)! '' No,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said coldly, <div class="bookquote">``I shall never be friends with you, Gilbert Blythe; and I don't want to be!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All right!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gilbert/Gilbert Blythe/Blythe</b></font>)</div>Gilbert sprang into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) skiff with an angry color in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) cheeks. <div class="bookquote">``I'll never ask you to be friends again, Anne Shirley. And I don't care either!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) pulled away with swift defiant strokes, and Anne went up the steep, ferny little path under the maples. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head very high, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was conscious of an odd feeling of regret. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) almost wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had answered Gilbert differently. Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) had insulted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) terribly, but still--! Altogether, Anne rather thought it would be a relief to sit down and have a good cry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was really quite unstrung, for the reaction from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) fright and cramped clinging was making itself felt.
<p/>Halfway up the path she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) met Jane and Diana rushing back to the pond in a state narrowly removed from positive frenzy. They had found nobody at Orchard Slope, both Mr. and Mrs. Barry being away. Here Ruby Gillis had succumbed to hysterics, and was left to recover from them as best she (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) might, while Jane and Diana flew through the Haunted Wood and across the brook to Green Gables. There they had found nobody either, for Marilla had gone to Carmody and Matthew was making hay in the back field. '' Oh, Anne,'' gasped Diana, fairly falling on the former's neck and weeping with relief and delight, <div class="bookquote">``oh, Anne--we thought--you were--drowned--and we felt like murderers--because we had made--you be--Elaine. And Ruby is in hysterics-- oh, Anne, how did you escape?''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I climbed up on one of the piles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>explained Anne wearily, <div class="bookquote">``and Gilbert Blythe came along in Mr. Andrews's dory and brought me to land.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Anne, how splendid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>)! Why, it's so romantic!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Andrews</b></font>)</div>said Jane, finding breath enough for utterance at last. <div class="bookquote">``Of course you'll speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) after this.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course I won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>flashed Anne, with a momentary return of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) old spirit. '' And I don't want ever to hear the word `romantic' again, Jane Andrews. I'm awfully sorry you were so frightened, girls. It is all my fault. I feel sure I was born under an unlucky star. Everything I do gets me or my dearest friends into a scrape. We've gone and lost your father's flat, Diana, and I have a presentiment that we'll not be allowed to row on the pond any more. '' Anne's presentiment proved more trustworthy than presentiments are apt to do.
<p/>Great was the consternation in the Barry and Cuthbert households when the events of the afternoon became known. <div class="bookquote">``Will you ever have any sense, Anne?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>groaned Marilla. '' Oh, yes, I think I will, Marilla,'' returned Anne optimistically. A good cry, indulged in the grateful solitude of the east gable, had soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) nerves and restored her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wonted cheerfulness. <div class="bookquote">``I think my prospects of becoming sensible are brighter now than ever.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't see how,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. '' Well,'' explained Anne, <div class="bookquote">``I've learned a new and valuable lesson today. Ever since I came to Green Gables I've been making mistakes, and each mistake has helped to cure me of some great shortcoming. The affair of the amethyst brooch cured me of meddling with things that didn't belong to me. The Haunted Wood mistake cured me of letting my imagination run away with me. The liniment cake mistake cured me of carelessness in cooking. Dyeing my hair cured me of vanity. I never think about my hair and nose now--at least, very seldom. And today's mistake is going to cure me of being too romantic. I have come to the conclusion that it is no use trying to be romantic in Avonlea. It was probably easy enough in towered Camelot hundreds of years ago, but romance is not appreciated now. I feel quite sure that you will soon see a great improvement in me in this respect, Marilla.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla skeptically. But Matthew, who had been sitting mutely in his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) corner, laid a hand on Anne's shoulder when Marilla had gone out. <div class="bookquote">``Don't give up all your romance, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) whispered shyly, ''
<p/>a little of it is a good thing--not too much, of course--but keep a little of it, Anne, keep a little of it.'' CHAPTER XXIX. An Epoch in Anne's Life |ANNE was bringing the cows home from the back pasture by way of Lover's Lane. It was a September evening and all the gaps and clearings in the woods were brimmed up with ruby sunset light. Here and there the lane was splashed with it, but for the most part it was already quite shadowy beneath the maples, and the spaces under the firs were filled with a clear violet dusk like airy wine. The winds were out in their tops, and there is no sweeter music on earth than that which the wind makes in the fir trees at evening. The cows swung placidly down the lane, and Anne followed them dreamily, repeating aloud the battle canto from Marmion --which had also been part of their English course the preceding winter and which Miss Stacy had made them learn off by heart--and exulting in its rushing lines and the clash of spears in its imagery. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) came to the lines The stubborn spearsmen still made good Their dark impenetrable wood, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) stopped in ecstasy to shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) eyes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) might the better fancy herself one of that heroic ring. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) opened them again it was to behold Diana coming through the gate that led into the Barry field and looking so important that Anne instantly divined there was news to be told. But betray too eager curiosity she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would not. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't this evening just like a purple dream, Diana? It makes me so glad to be alive. In the mornings I always think the mornings are best; but when evening comes I think it's lovelier still.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a very fine evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana, '' but oh, I have such news, Anne. Guess. You can have three guesses.'' <div class="bookquote">``Charlotte Gillis is going to be married in the church after all and Mrs. Allan wants us to decorate it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>cried Anne. '' No. Charlotte's beau won't agree to that, because nobody ever has been married in the church yet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>beau</b></font>) thinks it would seem too much like a funeral. It's too mean, because it would be such fun. Guess again.'' <div class="bookquote">``Jane's mother is going to let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) have a birthday party? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>Diana shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) head, her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) black eyes dancing with merriment. <div class="bookquote">``I can't think what it can be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne in despair, <div class="bookquote">``unless it's that Moody Spurgeon MacPherson saw you home from prayer meeting last night. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>MacPherson</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I should think not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Diana indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't be likely to boast of it if he (<font color='blue'><b>MacPherson</b></font>) did, the horrid creature!

There!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Diana,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>whispered Anne, finding it necessary to lean up against a maple tree for support, <div class="bookquote">``do you really mean it? But I'm afraid Marilla won't let me go. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) will say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) can't encourage gadding about. That was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) said last week when Jane invited me to go with them in their double-seated buggy to the American concert at the White Sands Hotel. I wanted to go, but Marilla said I'd be better at home learning my lessons and so would Jane. I was bitterly disappointed, Diana. I felt so heartbroken that I wouldn't say my prayers when I went to bed.
<p/>But I repented of that and got up in the middle of the night and said them.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana, <div class="bookquote">``we'll get Mother to ask Marilla. She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>)'ll be more likely to let you go then; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) does we'll have the time of our lives, Anne. I've never been to an Exhibition, and it's so aggravating to hear the other girls talking about their trips. Jane and Ruby have been twice, and they're going this year again.''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to think about it at all until I know whether I can go or not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne resolutely. <div class="bookquote">``If I did and then was disappointed, it would be more than I could bear. But in case I do go I'm very glad my new coat will be ready by that time. Marilla didn't think I needed a new coat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) said my old one would do very well for another winter and that I ought to be satisfied with having a new dress. The dress is very pretty, Diana--navy blue and made so fashionably. Marilla always makes my dresses fashionably now, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) doesn't intend to have Matthew going to Mrs. Lynde to make them. I'm so glad. It is ever so much easier to be good if your clothes are fashionable. At least, it is easier for me. I suppose it doesn't make such a difference to naturally good people. But Matthew said I must have a new coat, so Marilla bought a lovely piece of blue broadcloth, and it's being made by a real dressmaker over at Carmody.
<p/>It's to be done Saturday night, and I'm trying not to imagine myself walking up the church aisle on Sunday in my new suit and cap, because I'm afraid it isn't right to imagine such things. But it just slips into my mind in spite of me. My cap is so pretty. Matthew bought it for me the day we were over at Carmody. It is one of those little blue velvet ones that are all the rage, with gold cord and tassels. Your new hat is elegant, Diana, and so becoming. When I saw you come into church last Sunday my heart swelled with pride to think you were my dearest friend. Do you suppose it's wrong for us to think so much about our clothes? Marilla says it is very sinful. But it is such an interesting subject, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla agreed to let Anne go to town, and it was arranged that Mr. Barry should take the girls in on the following Tuesday. As Charlottetown was thirty miles away and Mr. Barry wished to go and return the same day, it was necessary to make a very early start. But Anne counted it all joy, and was up before sunrise on Tuesday morning. A glance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) window assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) that the day would be fine, for the eastern sky behind the firs of the Haunted Wood was all silvery and cloudless. Through the gap in the trees a light was shining in the western gable of Orchard Slope, a token that Diana was also up. Anne was dressed by the time Matthew had the fire on and had the breakfast ready when Marilla came down, but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) own part was much too excited to eat.
<p/>After breakfast the jaunty new cap and jacket were donned, and Anne hastened over the brook and up through the firs to Orchard Slope. Mr. Barry and Diana were waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>), and they were soon on the road. It was a long drive, but Anne and Diana enjoyed every minute of it. It was delightful to rattle along over the moist roads in the early red sunlight that was creeping across the shorn harvest fields. The air was fresh and crisp, and little smoke-blue mists curled through the valleys and floated off from the hills. Sometimes the road went through woods where maples were beginning to hang out scarlet banners; sometimes it crossed rivers on bridges that made Anne's flesh cringe with the old, half-delightful fear; sometimes it wound along a harbor shore and passed by a little cluster of weather-gray fishing huts; again it mounted to hills whence a far sweep of curving upland or misty-blue sky could be seen; but wherever it went there was much of interest to discuss. It was almost noon when they reached town and found their way to <div class="bookquote">``Beechwood. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was quite a fine old mansion, set back from the street in a seclusion of green elms and branching beeches. Miss Barry met them at the door with a twinkle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) sharp black eyes. <div class="bookquote">``So you've come to see me at last, you Anne-girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Mercy, child, how you have grown! You're taller than I am, I declare. And you're ever so much better looking than you used to be, too. But I dare say you know that without being told.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I didn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne radiantly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I'm not so freckled as I used to be, so I've much to be thankful for, but I really hadn't dared to hope there was any other improvement. I'm so glad you think there is, Miss Barry. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Barry/Josephine/Miss Josephine Barry</b></font>)</div>Miss Barry's house was furnished with <div class="bookquote">``great magnificence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Barry/Josephine/Miss Josephine Barry</b></font>)</div>as Anne told Marilla afterward. The two little country girls were rather abashed by the splendor of the parlor where Miss Barry left them when she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) went to see about dinner. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't it just like a palace?''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>whispered Diana. <div class="bookquote">``I never was in Aunt Josephine's house before, and I'd no idea it was so grand. I just wish Julia Bell could see this--she (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) puts on such airs about her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) mother's parlor.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Velvet carpet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>sighed Anne luxuriously, <div class="bookquote">``and silk curtains! I've dreamed of such things, Diana. But do you know I don't believe I feel very comfortable with them after all. There are so many things in this room and all so splendid that there is no scope for imagination. That is one consolation when you are poor--there are so many more things you can imagine about. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Their sojourn in town was something that Anne and Diana dated from for years. From first to last it was crowded with delights. On Wednesday Miss Barry took them to the Exhibition grounds and kept them there all day. <div class="bookquote">``It was splendid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne related to Marilla later on. <div class="bookquote">``I never imagined anything so interesting. I don't really know which department was the most interesting. I think I liked the horses and the flowers and the fancywork best. Josie Pye took first prize for knitted lace. I was real glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) did. And I was glad that I felt glad, for it shows I'm improving, don't you think, Marilla, when I can rejoice in Josie's success?
<p/>Mr. Harmon Andrews took second prize for Gravenstein apples and Mr. Bell took first prize for a pig. Diana said she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) thought it was ridiculous for a Sunday-school superintendent to take a prize in pigs, but I don't see why. Do you? She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) would always think of it after this when he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) was praying so solemnly. Clara Louise MacPherson took a prize for painting, and Mrs. Lynde got first prize for homemade butter and cheese. So Avonlea was pretty well represented, wasn't it? Mrs. Lynde was there that day, and I never knew how much I really liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) until I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) familiar face among all those strangers. There were thousands of people there, Marilla. It made me feel dreadfully insignificant. And Miss Barry took us up to the grandstand to see the horse races. Mrs. Lynde wouldn't go; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) said horse racing was an abomination and, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) being a church member, thought it her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) bounden duty to set a good example by staying away. But there were so many there I don't believe Mrs. Lynde's absence would ever be noticed. I don't think, though, that I ought to go very often to horse races, because they are awfully fascinating. Diana got so excited that she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) offered to bet me ten cents that the red horse would win. I didn't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) would, but I refused to bet, because I wanted to tell Mrs. Allan all about everything, and I felt sure it wouldn't do to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) that. It's always wrong to do anything you can't tell the minister's wife. It's as good as an extra conscience to have a minister's wife for your friend. And I was very glad I didn't bet, because the red horse did win, and I would have lost ten cents.
<p/>So you see that virtue was its own reward. We saw a man go up in a balloon. I'd love to go up in a balloon, Marilla; it would be simply thrilling; and we saw a man selling fortunes. You paid him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ten cents and a little bird picked out your fortune for you. Miss Barry gave Diana and me ten cents each to have our fortunes told. Mine was that I would marry a dark-complected man who was very wealthy, and I would go across water to live. I looked carefully at all the dark men I saw after that, but I didn't care much for any of them, and anyhow I suppose it's too early to be looking out for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) yet. Oh, it was a never-to-be-forgotten day, Marilla. I was so tired I couldn't sleep at night. Miss Barry put us in the spare room, according to promise. It was an elegant room, Marilla, but somehow sleeping in a spare room isn't what I used to think it was. That's the worst of growing up, and I'm beginning to realize it. The things you wanted so much when you were a child don't seem half so wonderful to you when you get them.''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>Thursday the girls had a drive in the park, and in the evening Miss Barry took them to a concert in the Academy of Music, where a noted prima donna was to sing. To Anne the evening was a glittering vision of delight. '' Oh, Marilla, it was beyond description. I was so excited I couldn't even talk, so you may know what it was like. I just sat in enraptured silence. Madame Selitsky was perfectly beautiful, and wore white satin and diamonds.
<p/>But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) began to sing I never thought about anything else. Oh, I can't tell you how I felt. But it seemed to me that it could never be hard to be good any more. I felt like I do when I look up to the stars. Tears came into my eyes, but, oh, they were such happy tears. I was so sorry when it was all over, and I told Miss Barry I didn't see how I was ever to return to common life again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) thought if we went over to the restaurant across the street and had an ice cream it might help me. That sounded so prosaic; but to my surprise I found it true. The ice cream was delicious, Marilla, and it was so lovely and dissipated to be sitting there eating it at eleven o'clock at night. Diana said she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) was born for city life. Miss Barry asked me what my opinion was, but I said I would have to think it over very seriously before I could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) what I really thought. So I thought it over after I went to bed. That is the best time to think things out. And I came to the conclusion, Marilla, that I wasn't born for city life and that I was glad of it. It's nice to be eating ice cream at brilliant restaurants at eleven o'clock at night once in a while; but as a regular thing I'd rather be in the east gable at eleven, sound asleep, but kind of knowing even in my sleep that the stars were shining outside and that the wind was blowing in the firs across the brook. I told Miss Barry so at breakfast the next morning and she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) laughed.
<p/>Miss Barry generally laughed at anything I said, even when I said the most solemn things. I don't think I liked it, Marilla, because I wasn't trying to be funny. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) is a most hospitable lady and treated us royally.'' Friday brought going-home time, and Mr. Barry drove in for the girls. '' Well, I hope you've enjoyed yourselves,'' said Miss Barry, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) bade them good-bye. '' Indeed we have,'' said Diana. <div class="bookquote">``And you, Anne-girl?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I've enjoyed every minute of the time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne, throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) arms impulsively about the old woman's neck and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wrinkled cheek. Diana would never have dared to do such a thing and felt rather aghast at Anne's freedom. But Miss Barry was pleased, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) stood on her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) veranda and watched the buggy out of sight. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) went back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) big house with a sigh. It seemed very lonely, lacking those fresh young lives. Miss Barry was a rather selfish old lady, if the truth must be told, and had never cared much for anybody but herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) valued people only as they were of service to her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) or amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>). Anne had amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and consequently stood high in the old lady's good graces. But Miss Barry found herself thinking less about Anne's quaint speeches than of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) fresh enthusiasms, her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) transparent emotions, her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) little winning ways, and the sweetness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) eyes and lips. <div class="bookquote">``I thought Marilla Cuthbert was an old fool when I heard she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>)'d adopted a girl out of an orphan asylum,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) said to herself, '' but I guess she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) didn't make much of a mistake after all. If I'd a child like Anne in the house all the time I'd be a better and happier woman. ''
<p/>Anne and Diana found the drive home as pleasant as the drive in--pleasanter, indeed, since there was the delightful consciousness of home waiting at the end of it. It was sunset when they passed through White Sands and turned into the shore road. Beyond, the Avonlea hills came out darkly against the saffron sky. Behind them the moon was rising out of the sea that grew all radiant and transfigured in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) light. Every little cove along the curving road was a marvel of dancing ripples. The waves broke with a soft swish on the rocks below them, and the tang of the sea was in the strong, fresh air. '' Oh, but it's good to be alive and to be going home,'' breathed Anne. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) crossed the log bridge over the brook the kitchen light of Green Gables winked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) a friendly welcome back, and through the open door shone the hearth fire, sending out its warm red glow athwart the chilly autumn night. Anne ran blithely up the hill and into the kitchen, where a hot supper was waiting on the table. '' So you've got back?'' said Marilla, folding up her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) knitting. '' Yes, and oh, it's so good to be back,'' said Anne joyously. <div class="bookquote">``I could kiss everything, even to the clock. Marilla, a broiled chicken! You don't mean to say you cooked that for me!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you'd be hungry after such a drive and need something real appetizing. Hurry and take off your things, and we'll have supper as soon as Matthew comes in. I'm glad you've got back, I must say. It's been fearful lonesome here without you, and I never put in four longer days.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><p/>After supper Anne sat before the fire between Matthew and Marilla, and gave them a full account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) visit. <div class="bookquote">``I've had a splendid time,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) concluded happily, <div class="bookquote">``and I feel that it marks an epoch in my life. But the best of it all was the coming home.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXX. The Queens Class Is Organized |MARILLA laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) knitting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) lap and leaned back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) chair. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) eyes were tired, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) thought vaguely that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) must see about having her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) glasses changed the next time she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) went to town, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) eyes had grown tired very often of late. It was nearly dark, for the full November twilight had fallen around Green Gables, and the only light in the kitchen came from the dancing red flames in the stove. Anne was curled up Turk-fashion on the hearthrug, gazing into that joyous glow where the sunshine of a hundred summers was being distilled from the maple cordwood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been reading, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) book had slipped to the floor, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was dreaming, with a smile on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) parted lips. Glittering castles in Spain were shaping themselves out of the mists and rainbows of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lively fancy; adventures wonderful and enthralling were happening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in cloudland-- adventures that always turned out triumphantly and never involved her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in scrapes like those of actual life. Marilla looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) with a tenderness that would never have been suffered to reveal itself in any clearer light than that soft mingling of fireshine and shadow. The lesson of a love that should display itself easily in spoken word and open look was one Marilla could never learn. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had learned to love this slim, gray-eyed girl with an affection all the deeper and stronger from its very undemonstrativeness.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) love made her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) afraid of being unduly indulgent, indeed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had an uneasy feeling that it was rather sinful to set one's heart so intensely on any human creature as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had set hers on Anne, and perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) performed a sort of unconscious penance for this by being stricter and more critical than if the girl had been less dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Certainly Anne herself had no idea how Marilla loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) sometimes thought wistfully that Marilla was very hard to please and distinctly lacking in sympathy and understanding. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) always checked the thought reproachfully, remembering what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) owed to Marilla. '' Anne,'' said Marilla abruptly, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Stacy was here this afternoon when you were out with Diana. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Anne came back from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) other world with a start and a sigh. '' Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)? Oh, I'm so sorry I wasn't in. Why didn't you call me, Marilla? Diana and I were only over in the Haunted Wood. It's lovely in the woods now. All the little wood things--the ferns and the satin leaves and the crackerberries--have gone to sleep, just as if somebody had tucked them away until spring under a blanket of leaves. I think it was a little gray fairy with a rainbow scarf that came tiptoeing along the last moonlight night and did it. Diana wouldn't say much about that, though. Diana has never forgotten the scolding her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) mother gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) about imagining ghosts into the Haunted Wood. It had a very bad effect on Diana's imagination. It blighted it. Mrs. Lynde says Myrtle Bell is a blighted being. I asked Ruby Gillis why Myrtle was blighted, and Ruby said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) guessed it was because her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) young man had gone back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>).
<p/>Ruby Gillis thinks of nothing but young men, and the older she (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) gets the worse she (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) is. Young men are all very well in their place, but it doesn't do to drag them into everything, does it? Diana and I are thinking seriously of promising each other that we will never marry but be nice old maids and live together forever. Diana hasn't quite made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) mind though, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) thinks perhaps it would be nobler to marry some wild, dashing, wicked young man and reform him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Diana and I talk a great deal about serious subjects now, you know. We feel that we are so much older than we used to be that it isn't becoming to talk of childish matters. It's such a solemn thing to be almost fourteen, Marilla. Miss Stacy took all us girls who are in our teens down to the brook last Wednesday, and talked to us about it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) said we couldn't be too careful what habits we formed and what ideals we acquired in our teens, because by the time we were twenty our characters would be developed and the foundation laid for our whole future life. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) said if the foundation was shaky we could never build anything really worth while on it. Diana and I talked the matter over coming home from school. We felt extremely solemn, Marilla. And we decided that we would try to be very careful indeed and form respectable habits and learn all we could and be as sensible as possible, so that by the time we were twenty our characters would be properly developed. It's perfectly appalling to think of being twenty, Marilla. It sounds so fearfully old and grown up. But why was Miss Stacy here this afternoon?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what I want to tell you, Anne, if you'll ever give me a chance to get a word in edgewise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was talking about you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``About me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne looked rather scared. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) flushed and exclaimed: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was saying. I meant to tell you, Marilla, honestly I did, but I forgot. Miss Stacy caught me reading Ben Hur in school yesterday afternoon when I should have been studying my Canadian history. Jane Andrews lent it to me. I was reading it at dinner hour, and I had just got to the chariot race when school went in. I was simply wild to know how it turned out--although I felt sure Ben Hur must win, because it wouldn't be poetical justice if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hur</b></font>) didn't-- so I spread the history open on my desk lid and then tucked Ben Hur between the desk and my knee. I just looked as if I were studying Canadian history, you know, while all the while I was reveling in Ben Hur. I was so interested in it that I never noticed Miss Stacy coming down the aisle until all at once I just looked up and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) was looking down at me, so reproachful-like. I can't tell you how ashamed I felt, Marilla, especially when I heard Josie Pye giggling. Miss Stacy took Ben Hur away, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) never said a word then. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) kept me in at recess and talked to me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) said I had done very wrong in two respects. First, I was wasting the time I ought to have put on my studies; and secondly, I was deceiving my teacher in trying to make it appear I was reading a history when it was a storybook instead.
<p/>I had never realized until that moment, Marilla, that what I was doing was deceitful. I was shocked. I cried bitterly, and asked Miss Stacy to forgive me and I'd never do such a thing again; and I offered to do penance by never so much as looking at Ben Hur for a whole week, not even to see how the chariot race turned out. But Miss Stacy said she (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) wouldn't require that, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) forgave me freely. So I think it wasn't very kind of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) to come up here to you about it after all.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Miss Stacy never mentioned such a thing to me, Anne, and its only your guilty conscience that's the matter with you. You have no business to be taking storybooks to school. You read too many novels anyhow. When I was a girl I wasn't so much as allowed to look at a novel.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how can you call Ben Hur a novel when it's really such a religious book? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>protested Anne. <div class="bookquote">``Of course it's a little too exciting to be proper reading for Sunday, and I only read it on weekdays. And I never read any book now unless either Miss Stacy or Mrs. Allan thinks it is a proper book for a girl thirteen and three-quarters to read. Miss Stacy made me promise that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) found me reading a book one day called, The Lurid Mystery of the Haunted Hall. It was one Ruby Gillis had lent me, and, oh, Marilla , it was so fascinating and creepy. It just curdled the blood in my veins. But Miss Stacy said it was a very silly, unwholesome book, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) asked me not to read any more of it or any like it.
<p/>I didn't mind promising not to read any more like it, but it was agonizing to give back that book without knowing how it turned out. But my love for Miss Stacy stood the test and I did. It's really wonderful, Marilla, what you can do when you're truly anxious to please a certain person.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I guess I'll light the lamp and get to work,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``I see plainly that you don't want to hear what Miss Stacy had to say.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed, Marilla, I do want to hear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>cried Anne contritely. <div class="bookquote">``I won't say another word--not one. I know I talk too much, but I am really trying to overcome it, and although I say far too much, yet if you only knew how many things I want to say and don't, you'd give me some credit for it. Please tell me, Marilla.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, Miss Stacy wants to organize a class among her (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) advanced students who mean to study for the entrance examination into Queen's.

And she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) came to ask Matthew and me if we would like to have you join it. What do you think about it yourself, Anne? Would you like to go to Queen's and pass for a teacher?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Marilla! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne straightened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knees and clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``It's been the dream of my life-- that is, for the last six months, ever since Ruby and Jane began to talk of studying for the Entrance. But I didn't say anything about it, because I supposed it would be perfectly useless. I'd love to be a teacher. But won't it be dreadfully expensive?
<p/>Mr. Andrews says it cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) one hundred and fifty dollars to put Prissy through, and Prissy wasn't a dunce in geometry.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I guess you needn't worry about that part of it. When Matthew and I took you to bring up we resolved we would do the best we could for you and give you a good education. I believe in a girl being fitted to earn her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own living whether she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ever has to or not. You'll always have a home at Green Gables as long as Matthew and I are here, but nobody knows what is going to happen in this uncertain world, and it's just as well to be prepared. So you can join the Queen's class if you like, Anne.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Marilla, thank you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) arms about Marilla's waist and looked up earnestly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``I'm extremely grateful to you and Matthew. And I'll study as hard as I can and do my very best to be a credit to you. I warn you not to expect much in geometry, but I think I can hold my own in anything else if I work hard.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dare say you'll get along well enough. Miss Stacy says you are bright and diligent. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Not for worlds would Marilla have told Anne just what Miss Stacy had said about her (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>); that would have been to pamper vanity. <div class="bookquote">``You needn't rush to any extreme of killing yourself over your books. There is no hurry. You won't be ready to try the Entrance for a year and a half yet. But it's well to begin in time and be thoroughly grounded, Miss Stacy says. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I shall take more interest than ever in my studies now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne blissfully, <div class="bookquote">``because I have a purpose in life.
<p/>Mr. Allan says everybody should have a purpose in life and pursue it faithfully. Only he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) says we must first make sure that it is a worthy purpose. I would call it a worthy purpose to want to be a teacher like Miss Stacy, wouldn't you, Marilla? I think it's a very noble profession. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>The Queen's class was organized in due time. Gilbert Blythe, Anne Shirley, Ruby Gillis, Jane Andrews, Josie Pye, Charlie Sloane, and Moody Spurgeon MacPherson joined it. Diana Barry did not, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) parents did not intend to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) to Queen's. This seemed nothing short of a calamity to Anne. Never, since the night on which Minnie May had had the croup, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and Diana been separated in anything. On the evening when the Queen's class first remained in school for the extra lessons and Anne saw Diana go slowly out with the others, to walk home alone through the Birch Path and Violet Vale, it was all the former could do to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Vale</b></font>) seat and refrain from rushing impulsively after her (<font color='blue'><b>Vale</b></font>) chum. A lump came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Vale</b></font>) throat, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Vale</b></font>) hastily retired behind the pages of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vale</b></font>) uplifted Latin grammar to hide the tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Vale</b></font>) eyes. Not for worlds would Anne have had Gilbert Blythe or Josie Pye see those tears. '' But, oh, Marilla, I really felt that I had tasted the bitterness of death, as Mr. Allan said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) sermon last Sunday, when I saw Diana go out alone,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) said mournfully that night. '' I thought how splendid it would have been if Diana had only been going to study for the Entrance, too. But we can't have things perfect in this imperfect world, as Mrs. Lynde says.
<p/>Mrs. Lynde isn't exactly a comforting person sometimes, but there's no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) says a great many very true things. And I think the Queen's class is going to be extremely interesting. Jane and Ruby are just going to study to be teachers. That is the height of their ambition. Ruby says she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) will only teach for two years after she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) gets through, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) intends to be married. Jane says she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) will devote her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) whole life to teaching, and never, never marry, because you are paid a salary for teaching, but a husband won't pay you anything, and growls if you ask for a share in the egg and butter money. I expect Jane speaks from mournful experience, for Mrs. Lynde says that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) father is a perfect old crank, and meaner than second skimmings. Josie Pye says she (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) is just going to college for education's sake, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) won't have to earn her (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) own living; she (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) says of course it is different with orphans who are living on charity-- they have to hustle. Moody Spurgeon is going to be a minister. Mrs. Lynde says he (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) couldn't be anything else with a name like that to live up to. I hope it isn't wicked of me, Marilla, but really the thought of Moody Spurgeon being a minister makes me laugh. He (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>)'s such a funny-looking boy with that big fat face, and his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) little blue eyes, and his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) ears sticking out like flaps. But perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) will be more intellectual looking when he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) grows up. Charlie Sloane says he (<font color='blue'><b>Sloane</b></font>)'s going to go into politics and be a member of Parliament, but Mrs. Lynde says he (<font color='blue'><b>Sloane</b></font>)'ll never succeed at that, because the Sloanes are all honest people, and it's only rascals that get on in politics nowadays.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is Gilbert Blythe going to be?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>queried Marilla, seeing that Anne was opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) Caesar. <div class="bookquote">``I don't happen to know what Gilbert Blythe's ambition in life is-- if he (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) has any,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne scornfully. There was open rivalry between Gilbert and Anne now. Previously the rivalry had been rather one-sided, but there was no longer any doubt that Gilbert was as determined to be first in class as Anne was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) was a foeman worthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) steel. The other members of the class tacitly acknowledged their superiority, and never dreamed of trying to compete with them. Since the day by the pond when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had refused to listen to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) plea for forgiveness, Gilbert, save for the aforesaid determined rivalry, had evinced no recognition whatever of the existence of Anne Shirley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) talked and jested with the other girls, exchanged books and puzzles with them, discussed lessons and plans, sometimes walked home with one or the other of them from prayer meeting or Debating Club. But Anne Shirley he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) simply ignored, and Anne found out that it is not pleasant to be ignored. It was in vain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) told herself with a toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not care. Deep down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wayward, feminine little heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did care, and that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had that chance of the Lake of Shining Waters again she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would answer very differently. All at once, as it seemed, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) secret dismay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found that the old resentment she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had cherished against him (<font color='blue'><b>Waters</b></font>) was gone-- gone just when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) most needed its sustaining power. It was in vain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) recalled every incident and emotion of that memorable occasion and tried to feel the old satisfying anger.
<p/>That day by the pond had witnessed its last spasmodic flicker. Anne realized that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had forgiven and forgotten without knowing it. But it was too late. And at least neither Gilbert nor anybody else, not even Diana, should ever suspect how sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) was and how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) hadn't been so proud and horrid! She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) determined to <div class="bookquote">``shroud her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) feelings in deepest oblivion,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and it may be stated here and now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) did it, so successfully that Gilbert, who possibly was not quite so indifferent as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) seemed, could not console himself with any belief that Anne felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) retaliatory scorn. The only poor comfort he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) had was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) snubbed Charlie Sloane, unmercifully, continually, and undeservedly. Otherwise the winter passed away in a round of pleasant duties and studies. For Anne the days slipped by like golden beads on the necklace of the year. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was happy, eager, interested; there were lessons to be learned and honor to be won; delightful books to read; new pieces to be practiced for the Sunday-school choir; pleasant Saturday afternoons at the manse with Mrs. Allan; and then, almost before Anne realized it, spring had come again to Green Gables and all the world was abloom once more. Studies palled just a wee bit then; the Queen's class, left behind in school while the others scattered to green lanes and leafy wood cuts and meadow byways, looked wistfully out of the windows and discovered that Latin verbs and French exercises had somehow lost the tang and zest they had possessed in the crisp winter months. Even Anne and Gilbert lagged and grew indifferent. Teacher and taught were alike glad when the term was ended and the glad vacation days stretched rosily before them. ''
<p/>But you've done good work this past year,'' Miss Stacy told them on the last evening, <div class="bookquote">``and you deserve a good, jolly vacation. Have the best time you can in the out-of-door world and lay in a good stock of health and vitality and ambition to carry you through next year. It will be the tug of war, you know--the last year before the Entrance.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Stacy/Stacy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to be back next year, Miss Stacy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Josie Pye/Josie/Pye</b></font>)</div>asked Josie Pye. Josie Pye never scrupled to ask questions; in this instance the rest of the class felt grateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>); none of them would have dared to ask it of Miss Stacy, but all wanted to, for there had been alarming rumors running at large through the school for some time that Miss Stacy was not coming back the next year--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) had been offered a position in the grade school of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) own home district and meant to accept. The Queen's class listened in breathless suspense for her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) answer. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Stacy/Stacy</b></font>)</div>said Miss Stacy. <div class="bookquote">``I thought of taking another school, but I have decided to come back to Avonlea. To tell the truth, I've grown so interested in my pupils here that I found I couldn't leave them. So I'll stay and see you through.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hurrah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody Spurgeon/Moody Spurgeon MacPherson</b></font>)</div>said Moody Spurgeon. Moody Spurgeon had never been so carried away by his (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) feelings before, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) blushed uncomfortably every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) thought about it for a week. '' Oh, I'm so glad,'' said Anne, with shining eyes. '' Dear Stacy, it would be perfectly dreadful if you didn't come back. I don't believe I could have the heart to go on with my studies at all if another teacher came here.
<p/>'' When Anne got home that night she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) stacked all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) textbooks away in an old trunk in the attic, locked it, and threw the key into the blanket box. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not even going to look at a schoolbook in vacation,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) told Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``I've studied as hard all the term as I possibly could and I've pored over that geometry until I know every proposition in the first book off by heart, even when the letters are changed. I just feel tired of everything sensible and I'm going to let my imagination run riot for the summer. Oh, you needn't be alarmed, Marilla. I'll only let it run riot within reasonable limits. But I want to have a real good jolly time this summer, for maybe it's the last summer I'll be a little girl. Mrs. Lynde says that if I keep stretching out next year as I've done this I'll have to put on longer skirts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) says I'm all running to legs and eyes. And when I put on longer skirts I shall feel that I have to live up to them and be very dignified. It won't even do to believe in fairies then , I'm afraid; so I'm going to believe in them with all my whole heart this summer. I think we're going to have a very gay vacation. Ruby Gillis is going to have a birthday party soon and there's the Sunday school picnic and the missionary concert next month. And Mr. Barry says that some evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>)'ll take Diana and me over to the White Sands Hotel and have dinner there. They have dinner there in the evening, you know.
<p/>Jane Andrews was over once last summer and she (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) says it was a dazzling sight to see the electric lights and the flowers and all the lady guests in such beautiful dresses. Jane says it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) first glimpse into high life and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)'ll never forget it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) dying day.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lynde/Mrs. Rachel/Rachel</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Lynde came up the next afternoon to find out why Marilla had not been at the Aid meeting on Thursday. When Marilla was not at Aid meeting people knew there was something wrong at Green Gables. <div class="bookquote">``Matthew had a bad spell with his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) heart Thursday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla explained, <div class="bookquote">``and I didn't feel like leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>). Oh, yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)'s all right again now, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) takes them spells oftener than he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) used to and I'm anxious about him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>). The doctor says he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) must be careful to avoid excitement. That's easy enough, for Matthew doesn't go about looking for excitement by any means and never did, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)'s not to do any very heavy work either and you might as well tell Matthew not to breathe as not to work. Come and lay off your things, Rachel. You'll stay to tea?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, seeing you're so pressing, perhaps I might as well, stay''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lynde/Mrs. Rachel/Rachel</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Rachel, who had not the slightest intention of doing anything else. Mrs. Rachel and Marilla sat comfortably in the parlor while Anne got the tea and made hot biscuits that were light and white enough to defy even Mrs. Rachel's criticism. <div class="bookquote">``I must say Anne has turned out a real smart girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lynde/Mrs. Rachel/Rachel</b></font>)</div>admitted Mrs. Rachel, as Marilla accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) to the end of the lane at sunset. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) must be a great help to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s real steady and reliable now.
<p/>I used to be afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'d never get over her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) featherbrained ways, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) has and I wouldn't be afraid to trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) in anything now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I never would have thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'d have turned out so well that first day I was here three years ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lynde/Mrs. Rachel/Rachel</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Rachel. '' Lawful heart, shall I ever forget that tantrum of hers! When I went home that night I says to Thomas, says I, `Mark my words, Thomas, Marilla Cuthbert 'll live to rue the step she (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)'s took.' But I was mistaken and I'm real glad of it. I ain't one of those kind of people, Marilla, as can never be brought to own up that they've made a mistake. No, that never was my way, thank goodness. I did make a mistake in judging Anne, but it weren't no wonder, for an odder, unexpecteder witch of a child there never was in this world, that's what. There was no ciphering her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) out by the rules that worked with other children. It's nothing short of wonderful how she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>)'s improved these three years, but especially in looks. She (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>)'s a real pretty girl got to be, though I can't say I'm overly partial to that pale, big-eyed style myself. I like more snap and color, like Diana Barry has or Ruby Gillis. Ruby Gillis's looks are real showy. But somehow--I don't know how it is but when Anne and them are together, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ain't half as handsome, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) makes them look kind of common and overdone--something like them white June lilies she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) calls narcissus alongside of the big, red peonies, that's what.'' CHAPTER XXXI. Where the Brook and River Meet |ANNE had her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``good''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>summer and enjoyed it wholeheartedly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and Diana fairly lived outdoors, reveling in all the delights that Lover's Lane and the Dryad's Bubble and Willowmere and Victoria Island afforded. Marilla offered no objections to Anne's gypsyings. The Spencervale doctor who had come the night Minnie May had the croup met Anne at the house of a patient one afternoon early in vacation, looked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) over sharply, screwed up his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) mouth, shook his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) head, and sent a message to Marilla Cuthbert by another person. It was: <div class="bookquote">``Keep that redheaded girl of yours in the open air all summer and don't let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) read books until she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gets more spring into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) step. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>This message frightened Marilla wholesomely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) read Anne's death warrant by consumption in it unless it was scrupulously obeyed. As a result, Anne had the golden summer of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) life as far as freedom and frolic went. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) walked, rowed, berried, and dreamed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart's content; and when September came she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was bright-eyed and alert, with a step that would have satisfied the Spencervale doctor and a heart full of ambition and zest once more. <div class="bookquote">``I feel just like studying with might and main,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) declared as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) books down from the attic. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you good old friends, I'm glad to see your honest faces once more-- yes, even you, geometry. I've had a perfectly beautiful summer, Marilla, and now I'm rejoicing as a strong man to run a race, as Mr. Allan said last Sunday. Doesn't Mr. Allan preach magnificent sermons? Mrs. Lynde says he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) is improving every day and the first thing we know some city church will gobble him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) up and then we'll be left and have to turn to and break in another green preacher.
<p/>But I don't see the use of meeting trouble halfway, do you, Marilla? I think it would be better just to enjoy Mr. Allan while we have him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>). If I were a man I think I'd be a minister. They can have such an influence for good, if their theology is sound; and it must be thrilling to preach splendid sermons and stir your hearers' hearts. Why can't women be ministers, Marilla? I asked Mrs. Lynde that and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) was shocked and said it would be a scandalous thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) said there might be female ministers in the States and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) believed there was, but thank goodness we hadn't got to that stage in Canada yet and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) hoped we never would. But I don't see why. I think women would make splendid ministers. When there is a social to be got up or a church tea or anything else to raise money the women have to turn to and do the work. I'm sure Mrs. Lynde can pray every bit as well as Superintendent Bell and I've no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) could preach too with a little practice.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) could,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla dryly. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) does plenty of unofficial preaching as it is. Nobody has much of a chance to go wrong in Avonlea with Rachel to oversee them.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne in a burst of confidence, <div class="bookquote">``I want to tell you something and ask you what you think about it. It has worried me terribly--on Sunday afternoons, that is, when I think specially about such matters. I do really want to be good; and when I'm with you or Mrs. Allan or Miss Stacy I want it more than ever and I want to do just what would please you and what you would approve of.
<p/>But mostly when I'm with Mrs. Lynde I feel desperately wicked and as if I wanted to go and do the very thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) tells me I oughtn't to do. I feel irresistibly tempted to do it. Now, what do you think is the reason I feel like that? Do you think it's because I'm really bad and unregenerate? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Marilla looked dubious for a moment. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``If you are I guess I am too, Anne, for Rachel often has that very effect on me. I sometimes think she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'d have more of an influence for good, as you say yourself, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) didn't keep nagging people to do right. There should have been a special commandment against nagging. But there, I shouldn't talk so. Rachel is a good Christian woman and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) means well. There isn't a kinder soul in Avonlea and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) never shirks her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) share of work. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm very glad you feel the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne decidedly. <div class="bookquote">``It's so encouraging. I shan't worry so much over that after this. But I dare say there'll be other things to worry me. They keep coming up new all the time--things to perplex you, you know. You settle one question and there's another right after. There are so many things to be thought over and decided when you're beginning to grow up. It keeps me busy all the time thinking them over and deciding what is right. It's a serious thing to grow up, isn't it, Marilla? But when I have such good friends as you and Matthew and Mrs. Allan and Miss Stacy I ought to grow up successfully, and I'm sure it will be my own fault if I don't. I feel it's a great responsibility because I have only the one chance.
<p/>If I don't grow up right I can't go back and begin over again. I've grown two inches this summer, Marilla. Mr. Gillis measured me at Ruby's party. I'm so glad you made my new dresses longer. That dark-green one is so pretty and it was sweet of you to put on the flounce. Of course I know it wasn't really necessary, but flounces are so stylish this fall and Josie Pye has flounces on all her (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) dresses. I know I'll be able to study better because of mine. I shall have such a comfortable feeling deep down in my mind about that flounce.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's worth something to have that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>admitted Marilla. Miss Stacy came back to Avonlea school and found all her (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) pupils eager for work once more. Especially did the Queen's class gird up their loins for the fray, for at the end of the coming year, dimly shadowing their pathway already, loomed up that fateful thing known as <div class="bookquote">``the Entrance,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>at the thought of which one and all felt their hearts sink into their very shoes. Suppose they did not pass! That thought was doomed to haunt Anne through the waking hours of that winter , Sunday afternoons inclusive, to the almost entire exclusion of moral and theological problems. When Anne had bad dreams she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found herself staring miserably at pass lists of the Entrance exams, where Gilbert Blythe's name was blazoned at the top and in which hers did not appear at all. But it was a jolly, busy, happy swift-flying winter. Schoolwork was as interesting, class rivalry as absorbing, as of yore. New worlds of thought, feeling, and ambition, fresh, fascinating fields of unexplored knowledge seemed to be opening out before Anne's eager eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Hills peeped o'er hill and Alps on Alps arose.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Stacy/Stacy</b></font>)</div>Much of all this was due to Miss Stacy's tactful, careful, broadminded guidance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) class to think and explore and discover for themselves and encouraged straying from the old beaten paths to a degree that quite shocked Mrs. Lynde and the school trustees, who viewed all innovations on established methods rather dubiously. Apart from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) studies Anne expanded socially, for Marilla, mindful of the Spencervale doctor's dictum, no longer vetoed occasional outings. The Debating Club flourished and gave several concerts; there were one or two parties almost verging on grown-up affairs; there were sleigh drives and skating frolics galore. Between times Anne grew, shooting up so rapidly that Marilla was astonished one day, when they were standing side by side, to find the girl was taller than herself. '' Why, Anne, how you've grown!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, almost unbelievingly. A sigh followed on the words. Marilla felt a queer regret over Anne's inches. The child she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had learned to love had vanished somehow and here was this tall, serious-eyed girl of fifteen, with the thoughtful brows and the proudly poised little head, in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) place. Marilla loved the girl as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had loved the child, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) was conscious of a queer sorrowful sense of loss. And that night, when Anne had gone to prayer meeting with Diana, Marilla sat alone in the wintry twilight and indulged in the weakness of a cry. Matthew, coming in with a lantern, caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) at it and gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) in such consternation that Marilla had to laugh through her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) tears. <div class="bookquote">``I was thinking about Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) explained. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'s got to be such a big girl--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'ll probably be away from us next winter. I'll miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) terrible.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'ll be able to come home often,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>comforted Matthew, to whom Anne was as yet and always would be the little, eager girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had brought home from Bright River on that June evening four years before. <div class="bookquote">``The branch railroad will be built to Carmody by that time.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It won't be the same thing as having her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) here all the time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>sighed Marilla gloomily, determined to enjoy her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) luxury of grief uncomforted. <div class="bookquote">``But there--men can't understand these things! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div>There were other changes in Anne no less real than the physical change. For one thing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) became much quieter. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought all the more and dreamed as much as ever, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) certainly talked less. Marilla noticed and commented on this also. <div class="bookquote">``You don't chatter half as much as you used to, Anne, nor use half as many big words. What has come over you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne colored and laughed a little, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) book and looked dreamily out of the window, where big fat red buds were bursting out on the creeper in response to the lure of the spring sunshine. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know--I don't want to talk as much,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, denting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) chin thoughtfully with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) forefinger. <div class="bookquote">``It's nicer to think dear, pretty thoughts and keep them in one's heart, like treasures. I don't like to have them laughed at or wondered over. And somehow I don't want to use big words any more. It's almost a pity, isn't it, now that I'm really growing big enough to say them if I did want to. It's fun to be almost grown up in some ways, but it's not the kind of fun I expected, Marilla. There's so much to learn and do and think that there isn't time for big words.
<p/>Besides, Miss Stacy says the short ones are much stronger and better. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) makes us write all our essays as simply as possible. It was hard at first. I was so used to crowding in all the fine big words I could think of--and I thought of any number of them. But I've got used to it now and I see it's so much better.''

It was silly to be writing about love and murder and elopements and mysteries. Miss Stacy sometimes has us write a story for training in composition, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) won't let us write anything but what might happen in Avonlea in our own lives, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) criticizes it very sharply and makes us criticize our own too. I never thought my compositions had so many faults until I began to look for them myself. I felt so ashamed I wanted to give up altogether, but Miss Stacy said I could learn to write well if I only trained myself to be my own severest critic. And so I am trying to.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You've only two more months before the Entrance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think you'll be able to get through?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne shivered. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know. Sometimes I think I'll be all right-- and then I get horribly afraid. We've studied hard and Miss Stacy has drilled us thoroughly, but we mayn't get through for all that. We've each got a stumbling block. Mine is geometry of course, and Jane's is Latin, and Ruby and Charlie's is algebra, and Josie's is arithmetic.
<p/>Moody Spurgeon says he (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) feels it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) bones that he (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) is going to fail in English history. Miss Stacy is going to give us examinations in June just as hard as we'll have at the Entrance and mark us just as strictly, so we'll have some idea. I wish it was all over, Marilla. It haunts me. Sometimes I wake up in the night and wonder what I'll do if I don't pass.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, go to school next year and try again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla unconcernedly. '' Oh, I don't believe I'd have the heart for it. It would be such a disgrace to fail, especially if Gil--if the others passed. And I get so nervous in an examination that I'm likely to make a mess of it. I wish I had nerves like Jane Andrews. Nothing rattles her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>). '' Anne sighed and, dragging her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes from the witcheries of the spring world, the beckoning day of breeze and blue, and the green things upspringing in the garden, buried herself resolutely in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) book. There would be other springs, but if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not succeed in passing the Entrance, Anne felt convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would never recover sufficiently to enjoy them. CHAPTER XXXII. The Pass List Is Out |WITH the end of June came the close of the term and the close of Miss Stacy's rule in Avonlea school. Anne and Diana walked home that evening feeling very sober indeed. Red eyes and damp handkerchiefs bore convincing testimony to the fact that Miss Stacy's farewell words must have been quite as touching as Mr. Phillips's had been under similar circumstances three years before. Diana looked back at the schoolhouse from the foot of the spruce hill and sighed deeply.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It does seem as if it was the end of everything, doesn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) said dismally. <div class="bookquote">``You oughtn't to feel half as badly as I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne, hunting vainly for a dry spot on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) handkerchief. <div class="bookquote">``You'll be back again next winter, but I suppose I've left the dear old school forever--if I have good luck, that is.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It won't be a bit the same. Miss Stacy won't be there, nor you nor Jane nor Ruby probably. I shall have to sit all alone, for I couldn't bear to have another deskmate after you. Oh, we have had jolly times, haven't we, Anne? It's dreadful to think they're all over.''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>Two big tears rolled down by Diana's nose. <div class="bookquote">``If you would stop crying I could,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne imploringly. <div class="bookquote">``Just as soon as I put away my hanky I see you brimming up and that starts me off again. As Mrs. Lynde says, `If you can't be cheerful, be as cheerful as you can.' After all, I dare say I'll be back next year. This is one of the times I know I'm not going to pass. They're getting alarmingly frequent.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, you came out splendidly in the exams Miss Stacy gave.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, but those exams didn't make me nervous. When I think of the real thing you can't imagine what a horrid cold fluttery feeling comes round my heart. And then my number is thirteen and Josie Pye says it's so unlucky. I am not superstitious and I know it can make no difference. But still I wish it wasn't thirteen.'' <div class="bookquote">``I do wish I was going in with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana. <div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't we have a perfectly elegant time? But I suppose you'll have to cram in the evenings.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; Miss Stacy has made us promise not to open a book at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) says it would only tire and confuse us and we are to go out walking and not think about the exams at all and go to bed early. It's good advice, but I expect it will be hard to follow; good advice is apt to be, I think. Prissy Andrews told me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) sat up half the night every night of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) Entrance week and crammed for dear life; and I had determined to sit up at least as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Stacy</b></font>) did. It was so kind of your Aunt Josephine to ask me to stay at Beechwood while I'm in town.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You'll write to me while you're in, won't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll write Tuesday night and tell you how the first day goes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>promised Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I'll be haunting the post office Wednesday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>vowed Diana. Anne went to town the following Monday and on Wednesday Diana haunted the post office, as agreed, and got her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) letter. '' Dearest Diana'' -LSB-wrote Anne-RSB-, ``Here it is Tuesday night and I'm writing this in the library at Beechwood. Last night I was horribly lonesome all alone in my room and wished so much you were with me. I couldn't `cram' because I'd promised Miss Stacy not to, but it was as hard to keep from opening my history as it used to be to keep from reading a story before my lessons were learned. ``This morning Miss Stacy came for me and we went to the Academy, calling for Jane and Ruby and Josie on our way. Ruby asked me to feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) hands and they were as cold as ice.
<p/>Josie said I looked as if I hadn't slept a wink and she (<font color='blue'><b>Josie</b></font>) didn't believe I was strong enough to stand the grind of the teacher's course even if I did get through. There are times and seasons even yet when I don't feel that I've made any great headway in learning to like Josie Pye! ``When we reached the Academy there were scores of students there from all over the Island. The first person we saw was Moody Spurgeon sitting on the steps and muttering away to himself. Jane asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) what on earth he (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) was doing and he (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) was repeating the multiplication table over and over to steady his (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) nerves and for pity's sake not to interrupt him (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>), because if he (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) stopped for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) got frightened and forgot everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) ever knew, but the multiplication table kept all his (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) facts firmly in their proper place! <div class="bookquote">``When we were assigned to our rooms Miss Stacy had to leave us. Jane and I sat together and Jane was so composed that I envied her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). No need of the multiplication table for good, steady, sensible Jane! I wondered if I looked as I felt and if they could hear my heart thumping clear across the room. Then a man came in and began distributing the English examination sheets. My hands grew cold then and my head fairly whirled around as I picked it up. Just one awful moment --Diana, I felt exactly as I did four years ago when I asked Marilla if I might stay at Green Gables--and then everything cleared up in my mind and my heart began beating again--I forgot to say that it had stopped altogether!--for I knew I could do something with that paper anyhow. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At noon we went home for dinner and then back again for history in the afternoon. The history was a pretty hard paper and I got dreadfully mixed up in the dates. Still, I think I did fairly well today. But oh, Diana, tomorrow the geometry exam comes off and when I think of it it takes every bit of determination I possess to keep from opening my Euclid. If I thought the multiplication table would help me any I would recite it from now till tomorrow morning. ``I went down to see the other girls this evening. On my way I met Moody Spurgeon wandering distractedly around. He (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) had failed in history and he (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) was born to be a disappointment to his (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) parents and he (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) was going home on the morning train; and it would be easier to be a carpenter than a minister, anyhow. I cheered him (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) up and persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) to stay to the end because it would be unfair to Miss Stacy if he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) didn't. Sometimes I have wished I was born a boy, but when I see Moody Spurgeon I'm always glad I'm a girl and not his (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) sister. <div class="bookquote">``Ruby was in hysterics when I reached their boardinghouse; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had just discovered a fearful mistake she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had made in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) English paper. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) recovered we went uptown and had an ice cream. How we wished you had been with us. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>Oh, Diana, if only the geometry examination were over! But there, as Mrs. Lynde would say, the sun will go on rising and setting whether I fail in geometry or not. That is true but not especially comforting. I think I'd rather it didn't go on if I failed! ''
<p/>Yours devotedly, <div class="bookquote">``Anne''  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>The geometry examination and all the others were over in due time and Anne arrived home on Friday evening, rather tired but with an air of chastened triumph about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Diana was over at Green Gables when she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) arrived and they met as if they had been parted for years. <div class="bookquote">``You old darling, it's perfectly splendid to see you back again. It seems like an age since you went to town and oh, Anne, how did you get along?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pretty well, I think, in everything but the geometry. I don't know whether I passed in it or not and I have a creepy, crawly presentiment that I didn't. Oh, how good it is to be back! Green Gables is the dearest, loveliest spot in the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How did the others do?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The girls say they know they didn't pass, but I think they did pretty well. Josie says the geometry was so easy a child of ten could do it! Moody Spurgeon still thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) failed in history and Charlie says he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) failed in algebra. But we don't really know anything about it and won't until the pass list is out. That won't be for a fortnight. Fancy living a fortnight in such suspense! I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up until it is over. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>Diana knew it would be useless to ask how Gilbert Blythe had fared, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) merely said: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you'll pass all right. Don't worry.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'd rather not pass at all than not come out pretty well up on the list,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>flashed Anne, by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) meant--and Diana knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) meant --that success would be incomplete and bitter if she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) did not come out ahead of Gilbert Blythe.
<p/>With this end in view Anne had strained every nerve during the examinations. So had Gilbert. They had met and passed each other on the street a dozen times without any sign of recognition and every time Anne had held her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head a little higher and wished a little more earnestly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had made friends with Gilbert when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and vowed a little more determinedly to surpass him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) in the examination. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew that all Avonlea junior was wondering which would come out first; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) even knew that Jimmy Glover and Ned Wright had a bet on the question and that Josie Pye had said there was no doubt in the world that Gilbert would be first; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) humiliation would be unbearable if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) failed. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) had another and nobler motive for wishing to do well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) wanted to <div class="bookquote">``pass high''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>for the sake of Matthew and Marilla--especially Matthew. Matthew had declared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) conviction that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``would beat the whole Island. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>That, Anne felt, was something it would be foolish to hope for even in the wildest dreams. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did hope fervently that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would be among the first ten at least, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might see Matthew's kindly brown eyes gleam with pride in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) achievement. That, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt, would be a sweet reward indeed for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hard work and patient grubbing among unimaginative equations and conjugations. At the end of the fortnight Anne took to <div class="bookquote">``haunting''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>the post office also, in the distracted company of Jane, Ruby, and Josie, opening the Charlottetown dailies with shaking hands and cold, sinkaway feelings as bad as any experienced during the Entrance week. Charlie and Gilbert were not above doing this too, but Moody Spurgeon stayed resolutely away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't got the grit to go there and look at a paper in cold blood,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>) told Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I'm just going to wait until somebody comes and tells me suddenly whether I've passed or not. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>When three weeks had gone by without the pass list appearing Anne began to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) really couldn't stand the strain much longer. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) appetite failed and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) interest in Avonlea doings languished. Mrs. Lynde wanted to know what else you could expect with a Tory superintendent of education at the head of affairs, and Matthew, noting Anne's paleness and indifference and the lagging steps that bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) home from the post office every afternoon, began seriously to wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) hadn't better vote Grit at the next election. But one evening the news came. Anne was sitting at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) open window, for the time forgetful of the woes of examinations and the cares of the world, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) drank in the beauty of the summer dusk, sweet-scented with flower breaths from the garden below and sibilant and rustling from the stir of poplars. The eastern sky above the firs was flushed faintly pink from the reflection of the west, and Anne was wondering dreamily if the spirit of color looked like that, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw Diana come flying down through the firs, over the log bridge, and up the slope, with a fluttering newspaper in her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) hand. Anne sprang to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) feet, knowing at once what that paper contained. The pass list was out! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head whirled and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart beat until it hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not move a step. It seemed an hour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) before Diana came rushing along the hall and burst into the room without even knocking, so great was her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) excitement.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anne, you've passed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``passed the very first --you and Gilbert both-- you're ties--but your name is first. Oh, I'm so proud!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Diana flung the paper on the table and herself on Anne's bed, utterly breathless and incapable of further speech. Anne lighted the lamp, oversetting the match safe and using up half a dozen matches before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) shaking hands could accomplish the task. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) snatched up the paper. Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had passed--there was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) name at the very top of a list of two hundred! That moment was worth living for. <div class="bookquote">``You did just splendidly, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>puffed Diana, recovering sufficiently to sit up and speak, for Anne, starry eyed and rapt, had not uttered a word. '' Father brought the paper home from Bright River not ten minutes ago--it came out on the afternoon train, you know, and won't be here till tomorrow by mail--and when I saw the pass list I just rushed over like a wild thing. You've all passed, every one of you, Moody Spurgeon and all, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Spurgeon</b></font>)'s conditioned in history. Jane and Ruby did pretty well--they're halfway up--and so did Charlie. Josie just scraped through with three marks to spare, but you'll see she (<font color='blue'><b>Josie</b></font>)'ll put on as many airs as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Josie</b></font>)'d led. Won't Miss Stacy be delighted? Oh, Anne, what does it feel like to see your name at the head of a pass list like that? If it were me I know I'd go crazy with joy. I am pretty near crazy as it is, but you're as calm and cool as a spring evening.'' <div class="bookquote">``I'm just dazzled inside,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I want to say a hundred things, and I can't find words to say them in. I never dreamed of this-- yes, I did too, just once!
<p/>I let myself think once , `What if I should come out first?' quakingly, you know, for it seemed so vain and presumptuous to think I could lead the Island. Excuse me a minute, Diana. I must run right out to the field to tell Matthew. Then we'll go up the road and tell the good news to the others. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>They hurried to the hayfield below the barn where Matthew was coiling hay, and, as luck would have it, Mrs. Lynde was talking to Marilla at the lane fence. '' Oh, Matthew,'' exclaimed Anne, <div class="bookquote">``I've passed and I'm first--or one of the first! I'm not vain, but I'm thankful.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well now, I always said it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>said Matthew, gazing at the pass list delightedly. <div class="bookquote">``I knew you could beat them all easy.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You've done pretty well, I must say, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, trying to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) extreme pride in Anne from Mrs. Rachel's critical eye. But that good soul said heartily: <div class="bookquote">``I just guess she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) has done well, and far be it from me to be backward in saying it. You're a credit to your friends, Anne , that's what, and we're all proud of you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>That night Anne, who had wound up the delightful evening with a serious little talk with Mrs. Allan at the manse, knelt sweetly by her (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) open window in a great sheen of moonshine and murmured a prayer of gratitude and aspiration that came straight from her (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) heart. There was in it thankfulness for the past and reverent petition for the future; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) slept on her (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) white pillow her (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) dreams were as fair and bright and beautiful as maidenhood might desire. CHAPTER XXXIII. The Hotel Concert |PUT on your white organdy, by all means, Anne,'' advised Diana decidedly.
<p/>They were together in the east gable chamber; outside it was only twilight--a lovely yellowish-green twilight with a clear-blue cloudless sky. A big round moon, slowly deepening from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) pallid luster into burnished silver, hung over the Haunted Wood; the air was full of sweet summer sounds--sleepy birds twittering, freakish breezes, faraway voices and laughter. But in Anne's room the blind was drawn and the lamp lighted, for an important toilet was being made. The east gable was a very different place from what it had been on that night four years before, when Anne had felt its bareness penetrate to the marrow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) spirit with its inhospitable chill. Changes had crept in, Marilla conniving at them resignedly, until it was as sweet and dainty a nest as a young girl could desire. The velvet carpet with the pink roses and the pink silk curtains of Anne's early visions had certainly never materialized; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) dreams had kept pace with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) growth, and it is not probable she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lamented them. The floor was covered with a pretty matting, and the curtains that softened the high window and fluttered in the vagrant breezes were of pale-green art muslin. The walls, hung not with gold and silver brocade tapestry, but with a dainty apple-blossom paper, were adorned with a few good pictures given Anne by Mrs. Allan. Miss Stacy's photograph occupied the place of honor, and Anne made a sentimental point of keeping fresh flowers on the bracket under it. Tonight a spike of white lilies faintly perfumed the room like the dream of a fragrance.
<p/>There was no <div class="bookquote">``mahogany furniture,''  (<font color='red'><b>a wicker rocker</b></font>)</div>but there was a white-painted bookcase filled with books, a cushioned wicker rocker, a toilet table befrilled with white muslin, a quaint, gilt-framed mirror with chubby pink Cupids and purple grapes painted over its arched top, that used to hang in the spare room, and a low white bed. Anne was dressing for a concert at the White Sands Hotel. The guests had got it up in aid of the Charlottetown hospital, and had hunted out all the available amateur talent in the surrounding districts to help it along. Bertha Sampson and Pearl Clay of the White Sands Baptist choir had been asked to sing a duet; Milton Clark of Newbridge was to give a violin solo; Winnie Adella Blair of Carmody was to sing a Scotch ballad; and Laura Spencer of Spencervale and Anne Shirley of Avonlea were to recite. As Anne would have said at one time, it was <div class="bookquote">``an epoch in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was deliciously athrill with the excitement of it. Matthew was in the seventh heaven of gratified pride over the honor conferred on his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) Anne and Marilla was not far behind, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would have died rather than admit it, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) didn't think it was very proper for a lot of young folks to be gadding over to the hotel without any responsible person with them. Anne and Diana were to drive over with Jane Andrews and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) brother Billy in their double-seated buggy; and several other Avonlea girls and boys were going too. There was a party of visitors expected out from town, and after the concert a supper was to be given to the performers. <div class="bookquote">``Do you really think the organdy will be best?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>queried Anne anxiously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it's as pretty as my blue-flowered muslin--and it certainly isn't so fashionable.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But it suits you ever so much better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana. <div class="bookquote">``It's so soft and frilly and clinging. The muslin is stiff, and makes you look too dressed up. But the organdy seems as if it grew on you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne sighed and yielded. Diana was beginning to have a reputation for notable taste in dressing, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) advice on such subjects was much sought after. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was looking very pretty herself on this particular night in a dress of the lovely wild-rose pink, from which Anne was forever debarred; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was not to take any part in the concert, so her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) appearance was of minor importance. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) pains were bestowed upon Anne, who, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) vowed, must, for the credit of Avonlea, be dressed and combed and adorned to the Queen's taste. '' Pull out that frill a little more--so; here, let me tie your sash; now for your slippers. I'm going to braid your hair in two thick braids, and tie them halfway up with big white bows--no, don't pull out a single curl over your forehead--just have the soft part. There is no way you do your hair suits you so well, Anne, and Mrs. Allan says you look like a Madonna when you part it so. I shall fasten this little white house rose just behind your ear. There was just one on my bush, and I saved it for you.'' <div class="bookquote">``Shall I put my pearl beads on? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>asked Anne. <div class="bookquote">``Matthew brought me a string from town last week, and I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)'d like to see them on me. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div><p/>Diana pursed up her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) lips, put her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) black head on one side critically, and finally pronounced in favor of the beads, which were thereupon tied around Anne's slim milk-white throat. <div class="bookquote">``There's something so stylish about you, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana, with unenvious admiration. <div class="bookquote">``You hold your head with such an air. I suppose it's your figure. I am just a dumpling. I've always been afraid of it, and now I know it is so. Well, I suppose I shall just have to resign myself to it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you have such dimples,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne, smiling affectionately into the pretty, vivacious face so near her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own. '' Lovely dimples, like little dents in cream. I have given up all hope of dimples. My dimple-dream will never come true; but so many of my dreams have that I mustn't complain. Am I all ready now?'' <div class="bookquote">``All ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>assured Diana, as Marilla appeared in the doorway, a gaunt figure with grayer hair than of yore and no fewer angles, but with a much softer face. '' Come right in and look at our elocutionist, Marilla. Doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) look lovely? '' Marilla emitted a sound between a sniff and a grunt. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) looks neat and proper. I like that way of fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) hair. But I expect she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'ll ruin that dress driving over there in the dust and dew with it, and it looks most too thin for these damp nights. Organdy's the most unserviceable stuff in the world anyhow, and I told Matthew so when he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) got it. But there is no use in saying anything to Matthew nowadays. Time was when he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) would take my advice, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) just buys things for Anne regardless, and the clerks at Carmody know they can palm anything off on him (<font color='blue'><b>Carmody</b></font>).
<p/>Just let them tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Carmody</b></font>) a thing is pretty and fashionable, and Matthew plunks his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) money down for it. Mind you keep your skirt clear of the wheel, Anne, and put your warm jacket on.'' Then Marilla stalked downstairs, thinking proudly how sweet Anne looked, with that <div class="bookquote">``One moonbeam from the forehead to the crown''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>and regretting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not go to the concert herself to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) girl recite. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder if it is too damp for my dress,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne anxiously. <div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana, pulling up the window blind. <div class="bookquote">``It's a perfect night, and there won't be any dew. Look at the moonlight.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm so glad my window looks east into the sun rising,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne, going over to Diana. <div class="bookquote">``It's so splendid to see the morning coming up over those long hills and glowing through those sharp fir tops. It's new every morning, and I feel as if I washed my very soul in that bath of earliest sunshine. Oh, Diana, I love this little room so dearly. I don't know how I'll get along without it when I go to town next month.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't speak of your going away tonight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>begged Diana. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to think of it, it makes me so miserable, and I do want to have a good time this evening. What are you going to recite, Anne? And are you nervous?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit. I've recited so often in public I don't mind at all now. I've decided to give `The Maiden's Vow.' It's so pathetic. Laura Spencer is going to give a comic recitation, but I'd rather make people cry than laugh.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What will you recite if they encore you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They won't dream of encoring me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>scoffed Anne, who was not without her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own secret hopes that they would, and already visioned herself telling Matthew all about it at the next morning's breakfast table. <div class="bookquote">``There are Billy and Jane now--I hear the wheels. Come on.''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy</b></font>)</div>Billy Andrews insisted that Anne should ride on the front seat with him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>), so she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) unwillingly climbed up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would have much preferred to sit back with the girls, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could have laughed and chattered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart's content. There was not much of either laughter or chatter in Billy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) was a big, fat, stolid youth of twenty, with a round, expressionless face, and a painful lack of conversational gifts. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) admired Anne immensely, and was puffed up with pride over the prospect of driving to White Sands with that slim, upright figure beside him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>). Anne, by dint of talking over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) shoulder to the girls and occasionally passing a sop of civility to Billy--who grinned and chuckled and never could think of any reply until it was too late--contrived to enjoy the drive in spite of all. It was a night for enjoyment. The road was full of buggies, all bound for the hotel, and laughter, silver clear, echoed and reechoed along it. When they reached the hotel it was a blaze of light from top to bottom. They were met by the ladies of the concert committee, one of whom took Anne off to the performers' dressing room which was filled with the members of a Charlottetown Symphony Club, among whom Anne felt suddenly shy and frightened and countrified.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) dress, which, in the east gable, had seemed so dainty and pretty, now seemed simple and plain--too simple and plain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought, among all the silks and laces that glistened and rustled around her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). What were her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) pearl beads compared to the diamonds of the big, handsome lady near her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)? And how poor her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) one wee white rose must look beside all the hothouse flowers the others wore! Anne laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hat and jacket away, and shrank miserably into a corner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wished herself back in the white room at Green Gables. It was still worse on the platform of the big concert hall of the hotel, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) presently found herself. The electric lights dazzled her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes, the perfume and hum bewildered her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) were sitting down in the audience with Diana and Jane, who seemed to be having a splendid time away at the back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was wedged in between a stout lady in pink silk and a tall, scornful-looking girl in a white-lace dress. The stout lady occasionally turned her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head squarely around and surveyed Anne through her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyeglasses until Anne, acutely sensitive of being so scrutinized, felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must scream aloud; and the white-lace girl kept talking audibly to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) next neighbor about the <div class="bookquote">``country bumpkins''  (<font color='red'><b>neighbor belles</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``rustic belles''  (<font color='red'><b>neighbor belles</b></font>)</div>in the audience, languidly anticipating <div class="bookquote">``such fun''  (<font color='red'><b>the audience</b></font>)</div>from the displays of local talent on the program. Anne believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would hate that white-lace girl to the end of life. Unfortunately for Anne, a professional elocutionist was staying at the hotel and had consented to recite. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was a lithe, dark-eyed woman in a wonderful gown of shimmering gray stuff like woven moonbeams, with gems on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) neck and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) dark hair.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had a marvelously flexible voice and wonderful power of expression; the audience went wild over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) selection. Anne, forgetting all about herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) troubles for the time, listened with rapt and shining eyes; but when the recitation ended she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) suddenly put her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could never get up and recite after that--never. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ever thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could recite? Oh, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) were only back at Green Gables! At this unpropitious moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) name was called. Somehow Anne--who did not notice the rather guilty little start of surprise the white-lace girl gave, and would not have understood the subtle compliment implied therein if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had--got on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feet, and moved dizzily out to the front. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was so pale that Diana and Jane, down in the audience, clasped each other's hands in nervous sympathy. Anne was the victim of an overwhelming attack of stage fright. Often as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had recited in public, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had never before faced such an audience as this, and the sight of it paralyzed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) energies completely. Everything was so strange, so brilliant, so bewildering--the rows of ladies in evening dress, the critical faces, the whole atmosphere of wealth and culture about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Very different this from the plain benches at the Debating Club, filled with the homely, sympathetic faces of friends and neighbors. These people, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought, would be merciless critics. Perhaps, like the white-lace girl, they anticipated amusement from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``rustic''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>efforts. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt hopelessly, helplessly ashamed and miserable. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knees trembled, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart fluttered, a horrible faintness came over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); not a word could she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) utter, and the next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would have fled from the platform despite the humiliation which, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt, must ever after be her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) portion if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did so.
<p/>But suddenly, as her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dilated, frightened eyes gazed out over the audience, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saw Gilbert Blythe away at the back of the room, bending forward with a smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) face--a smile which seemed to Anne at once triumphant and taunting. In reality it was nothing of the kind. Gilbert was merely smiling with appreciation of the whole affair in general and of the effect produced by Anne's slender white form and spiritual face against a background of palms in particular. Josie Pye, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) had driven over, sat beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) face certainly was both triumphant and taunting. But Anne did not see Josie, and would not have cared if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) drew a long breath and flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head up proudly, courage and determination tingling over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) like an electric shock. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would not fail before Gilbert Blythe--he (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) should never be able to laugh at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), never, never! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) fright and nervousness vanished; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) began her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) recitation, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) clear, sweet voice reaching to the farthest corner of the room without a tremor or a break. Self-possession was fully restored to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and in the reaction from that horrible moment of powerlessness she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) recited as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had never done before. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) finished there were bursts of honest applause. Anne, stepping back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) seat, blushing with shyness and delight, found her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand vigorously clasped and shaken by the stout lady in pink silk. <div class="bookquote">``My dear, you did splendidly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) puffed. <div class="bookquote">``I've been crying like a baby, actually I have. There, they're encoring you--they're bound to have you back!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I can't go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne confusedly. '' But yet--I must, or Matthew will be disappointed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) said they would encore me.'' <div class="bookquote">``Then don't disappoint Matthew,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady laughing</b></font>)</div>said the pink lady, laughing.
<p/>Smiling, blushing, limpid eyed, Anne tripped back and gave a quaint, funny little selection that captivated her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) audience still further. The rest of the evening was quite a little triumph for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). When the concert was over, the stout, pink lady--who was the wife of an American millionaire--took her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) under her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wing, and introduced her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to everybody; and everybody was very nice to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). The professional elocutionist, Mrs. Evans, came and chatted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>), telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) had a charming voice and <div class="bookquote">``interpreted''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) selections beautifully. Even the white-lace girl paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) a languid little compliment. They had supper in the big, beautifully decorated dining room; Diana and Jane were invited to partake of this, also, since they had come with Anne, but Billy was nowhere to be found, having decamped in mortal fear of some such invitation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) was in waiting for them, with the team, however, when it was all over, and the three girls came merrily out into the calm, white moonshine radiance. Anne breathed deeply, and looked into the clear sky beyond the dark boughs of the firs. Oh, it was good to be out again in the purity and silence of the night! How great and still and wonderful everything was, with the murmur of the sea sounding through it and the darkling cliffs beyond like grim giants guarding enchanted coasts. '' Hasn't it been a perfectly splendid time?'' sighed Jane, as they drove away. <div class="bookquote">``I just wish I was a rich American and could spend my summer at a hotel and wear jewels and low-necked dresses and have ice cream and chicken salad every blessed day. I'm sure it would be ever so much more fun than teaching school.
<p/>Anne, your recitation was simply great, although I thought at first you were never going to begin. I think it was better than Mrs. Evans's.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, don't say things like that, Jane,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne quickly, <div class="bookquote">``because it sounds silly. It couldn't be better than Mrs. Evans's, you know, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) is a professional, and I'm only a schoolgirl, with a little knack of reciting. I'm quite satisfied if the people just liked mine pretty well.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I've a compliment for you, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana. <div class="bookquote">``At least I think it must be a compliment because of the tone he (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said it in. Part of it was anyhow. There was an American sitting behind Jane and me--such a romantic-looking man, with coal-black hair and eyes. Josie Pye says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a distinguished artist, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) mother's cousin in Boston is married to a man that used to go to school with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Well, we heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) say--didn't we, Jane?--`Who is that girl on the platform with the splendid Titian hair? She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) has a face I should like to paint.' There now, Anne. But what does Titian hair mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Being interpreted it means plain red, I guess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>laughed Anne. <div class="bookquote">``Titian was a very famous artist who liked to paint red-haired women.''  (<font color='red'><b>those ladies</b></font>)</div>'' Did you see all the diamonds those ladies wore? '' sighed Jane. <div class="bookquote">``They were simply dazzling. Wouldn't you just love to be rich, girls?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We are rich,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne staunchly. <div class="bookquote">``Why, we have sixteen years to our credit, and we're happy as queens, and we've all got imaginations, more or less. Look at that sea, girls--all silver and shadow and vision of things not seen. We couldn't enjoy its loveliness any more if we had millions of dollars and ropes of diamonds.
<p/>You wouldn't change into any of those women if you could. Would you want to be that white-lace girl and wear a sour look all your life, as if you'd been born turning up your nose at the world? Or the pink lady, kind and nice as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is, so stout and short that you'd really no figure at all? Or even Mrs. Evans, with that sad, sad look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) eyes? She (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) must have been dreadfully unhappy sometime to have such a look. You know you wouldn't, Jane Andrews!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know--exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Andrews</b></font>)</div>said Jane unconvinced. <div class="bookquote">``I think diamonds would comfort a person for a good deal.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't want to be anyone but myself, even if I go uncomforted by diamonds all my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>declared Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I'm quite content to be Anne of Green Gables, with my string of pearl beads. I know Matthew gave me as much love with them as ever went with Madame the Pink Lady's jewels.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXXIV. A Queen's Girl |THE next three weeks were busy ones at Green Gables, for Anne was getting ready to go to Queen's, and there was much sewing to be done, and many things to be talked over and arranged. Anne's outfit was ample and pretty, for Matthew saw to that, and Marilla for once made no objections whatever to anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) purchased or suggested. More--one evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) went up to the east gable with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) arms full of a delicate pale green material. '' Anne, here's something for a nice light dress for you. I don't suppose you really need it; you've plenty of pretty waists; but I thought maybe you'd like something real dressy to wear if you were asked out anywhere of an evening in town, to a party or anything like that.
<p/>I hear that Jane and Ruby and Josie have got `evening dresses,' as they call them, and I don't mean you shall be behind them. I got Mrs. Allan to help me pick it in town last week, and we'll get Emily Gillis to make it for you. Emily has got taste, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) fits aren't to be equaled.'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Marilla, it's just lovely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you so much. I don't believe you ought to be so kind to me--it's making it harder every day for me to go away. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emily/Emily Clay</b></font>)</div>The green dress was made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings as Emily's taste permitted. Anne put it on one evening for Matthew's and Marilla's benefit, and recited <div class="bookquote">``The Maiden's Vow''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>for them in the kitchen. As Marilla watched the bright, animated face and graceful motions her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) thoughts went back to the evening Anne had arrived at Green Gables, and memory recalled a vivid picture of the odd, frightened child in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) preposterous yellowish-brown wincey dress, the heartbreak looking out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tearful eyes. Something in the memory brought tears to Marilla's own eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I declare, my recitation has made you cry, Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne gaily stooping over Marilla's chair to drop a butterfly kiss on that lady's cheek. <div class="bookquote">``Now, I call that a positive triumph.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I wasn't crying over your piece,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, who would have scorned to be betrayed into such weakness by any poetry stuff. <div class="bookquote">``I just couldn't help thinking of the little girl you used to be, Anne. And I was wishing you could have stayed a little girl, even with all your queer ways. You've grown up now and you're going away; and you look so tall and stylish
<p/>and so--so--different altogether in that dress--as if you didn't belong in Avonlea at all--and I just got lonesome thinking it all over.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Marilla!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne sat down on Marilla's gingham lap, took Marilla's lined face between her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) hands, and looked gravely and tenderly into Marilla's eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not a bit changed--not really. I'm only just pruned down and branched out. The real me --back here--is just the same. It won't make a bit of difference where I go or how much I change outwardly; at heart I shall always be your little Anne, who will love you and Matthew and dear Green Gables more and better every day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) life.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) fresh young cheek against Marilla's faded one, and reached out a hand to pat Matthew's shoulder. Marilla would have given much just then to have possessed Anne's power of putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) feelings into words; but nature and habit had willed it otherwise, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) could only put her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) arms close about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) girl and hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) tenderly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) heart, wishing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) need never let her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) go. Matthew, with a suspicious moisture in his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) eyes, got up and went out-of-doors. Under the stars of the blue summer night he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) walked agitatedly across the yard to the gate under the poplars. '' Well now, I guess she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) ain't been much spoiled,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) muttered, proudly. <div class="bookquote">``I guess my putting in my oar occasional never did much harm after all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s smart and pretty, and loving, too, which is better than all the rest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>)'s been a blessing to us, and there never was a luckier mistake than what Mrs. Spencer made--if it was luck. I don't believe it was any such thing. It was Providence, because the Almighty saw we needed her (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>), I reckon.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>The day finally came when Anne must go to town. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and Matthew drove in one fine September morning, after a tearful parting with Diana and an untearful practical one--on Marilla's side at least--with Marilla. But when Anne had gone Diana dried her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tears and went to a beach picnic at White Sands with some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) Carmody cousins, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) contrived to enjoy herself tolerably well; while Marilla plunged fiercely into unnecessary work and kept at it all day long with the bitterest kind of heartache--the ache that burns and gnaws and cannot wash itself away in ready tears. But that night, when Marilla went to bed, acutely and miserably conscious that the little gable room at the end of the hall was untenanted by any vivid young life and unstirred by any soft breathing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) pillow, and wept for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) girl in a passion of sobs that appalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) grew calm enough to reflect how very wicked it must be to take on so about a sinful fellow creature. Anne and the rest of the Avonlea scholars reached town just in time to hurry off to the Academy. That first day passed pleasantly enough in a whirl of excitement, meeting all the new students, learning to know the professors by sight and being assorted and organized into classes. Anne intended taking up the Second Year work being advised to do so by Miss Stacy; Gilbert Blythe elected to do the same. This meant getting a First Class teacher's license in one year instead of two, if they were successful; but it also meant much more and harder work.
<p/>Jane, Ruby, Josie, Charlie, and Moody Spurgeon, not being troubled with the stirrings of ambition, were content to take up the Second Class work. Anne was conscious of a pang of loneliness when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found herself in a room with fifty other students, not one of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew, except the tall, brown-haired boy across the room; and knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in the fashion she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did, did not help her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) much, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) reflected pessimistically. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was undeniably glad that they were in the same class; the old rivalry could still be carried on, and Anne would hardly have known what to do if it had been lacking. <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't feel comfortable without it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``Gilbert looks awfully determined. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>)'s making up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) mind, here and now, to win the medal. What a splendid chin he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) has! I never noticed it before. I do wish Jane and Ruby had gone in for First Class, too. I suppose I won't feel so much like a cat in a strange garret when I get acquainted, though. I wonder which of the girls here are going to be my friends. It's really an interesting speculation. Of course I promised Diana that no Queen's girl, no matter how much I liked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), should ever be as dear to me as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is; but I've lots of second-best affections to bestow. I like the look of that girl with the brown eyes and the crimson waist. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looks vivid and red-rosy; there's that pale, fair one gazing out of the window. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has lovely hair, and looks as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew a thing or two about dreams. I'd like to know them both --know them well--well enough to walk with my arm about their waists, and call them nicknames.
<p/>But just now I don't know them and they don't know me, and probably don't want to know me particularly. Oh, it's lonesome! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>It was lonesomer still when Anne found herself alone in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hall bedroom that night at twilight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was not to board with the other girls, who all had relatives in town to take pity on them. Miss Josephine Barry would have liked to board her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>), but Beechwood was so far from the Academy that it was out of the question; so Miss Barry hunted up a boarding-house, assuring Matthew and Marilla that it was the very place for Anne. '' The lady who keeps it is a reduced gentlewoman,'' explained Miss Barry. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) husband was a British officer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) is very careful what sort of boarders she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) takes. Anne will not meet with any objectionable persons under her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) roof. The table is good, and the house is near the Academy, in a quiet neighborhood. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>All this might be quite true, and indeed, proved to be so, but it did not materially help Anne in the first agony of homesickness that seized upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) looked dismally about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) narrow little room, with its dull-papered, pictureless walls, its small iron bedstead and empty book-case; and a horrible choke came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) throat as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own white room at Green Gables, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would have the pleasant consciousness of a great green still outdoors, of sweet peas growing in the garden, and moonlight falling on the orchard, of the brook below the slope and the spruce boughs tossing in the night wind beyond it, of a vast starry sky, and the light from Diana's window shining out through the gap in the trees.
<p/>Here there was nothing of this; Anne knew that outside of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) window was a hard street, with a network of telephone wires shutting out the sky, the tramp of alien feet, and a thousand lights gleaming on stranger faces. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was going to cry, and fought against it. <div class="bookquote">``I won't cry. It's silly--and weak--there's the third tear splashing down by my nose. There are more coming! I must think of something funny to stop them. But there's nothing funny except what is connected with Avonlea, and that only makes things worse--four--five--I'm going home next Friday, but that seems a hundred years away. Oh, Matthew is nearly home by now--and Marilla is at the gate, looking down the lane for him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)--six--seven--eight --oh, there's no use in counting them! They're coming in a flood presently. I can't cheer up--I don't want to cheer up. It's nicer to be miserable!''  (<font color='red'><b>Josie Pye/Josie/Pye</b></font>)</div>The flood of tears would have come, no doubt, had not Josie Pye appeared at that moment. In the joy of seeing a familiar face Anne forgot that there had never been much love lost between her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and Josie. As a part of Avonlea life even a Pye was welcome. <div class="bookquote">``I'm so glad you came up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne said sincerely. <div class="bookquote">``You've been crying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Josie Pye/Josie/Pye</b></font>)</div>remarked Josie, with aggravating pity. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you're homesick--some people have so little self-control in that respect. I've no intention of being homesick, I can tell you. Town's too jolly after that poky old Avonlea. I wonder how I ever existed there so long. You shouldn't cry, Anne; it isn't becoming, for your nose and eyes get red, and then you seem all red. I'd a perfectly scrumptious time in the Academy today. Our French professor is simply a duck.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) moustache would give you kerwollowps of the heart. Have you anything eatable around, Anne? I'm literally starving. Ah, I guessed likely Marilla 'd load you up with cake. That's why I called round. Otherwise I'd have gone to the park to hear the band play with Frank Stockley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stockley</b></font>) boards same place as I do, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stockley</b></font>)'s a sport. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stockley</b></font>) noticed you in class today, and asked me who the red-headed girl was. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Stockley</b></font>) you were an orphan that the Cuthberts had adopted, and nobody knew very much about what you'd been before that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne was wondering if, after all, solitude and tears were not more satisfactory than Josie Pye's companionship when Jane and Ruby appeared, each with an inch of Queen's color ribbon--purple and scarlet--pinned proudly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) coat. As Josie was not <div class="bookquote">``speaking''  (<font color='red'><b>Josie Pye/Josie/Pye</b></font>)</div>to Jane just then she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had to subside into comparative harmlessness. '' Well,'' said Jane with a sigh, <div class="bookquote">``I feel as if I'd lived many moons since the morning. I ought to be home studying my Virgil--that horrid old professor gave us twenty lines to start in on tomorrow. But I simply couldn't settle down to study tonight. Anne, methinks I see the traces of tears. If you've been crying do own up. It will restore my self-respect, for I was shedding tears freely before Ruby came along. I don't mind being a goose so much if somebody else is goosey, too. Cake? You'll give me a teeny piece, won't you? Thank you. It has the real Avonlea flavor. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Andrews</b></font>)</div>Ruby, perceiving the Queen's calendar lying on the table, wanted to know if Anne meant to try for the gold medal. Anne blushed and admitted she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was thinking of it. ''
<p/>Oh, that reminds me,'' said Josie, <div class="bookquote">``Queen's is to get one of the Avery scholarships after all. The word came today. Frank Stockley told me--his (<font color='blue'><b>Stockley</b></font>) uncle is one of the board of governors, you know. It will be announced in the Academy tomorrow.''  (<font color='red'><b>Josie Pye/Josie/Pye</b></font>)</div>An Avery scholarship! Anne felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart beat more quickly, and the horizons of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ambition shifted and broadened as if by magic. Before Josie had told the news Anne's highest pinnacle of aspiration had been a teacher's provincial license, First Class, at the end of the year, and perhaps the medal! But now in one moment Anne saw herself winning the Avery scholarship, taking an Arts course at Redmond College, and graduating in a gown and mortar board, before the echo of Josie's words had died away. For the Avery scholarship was in English, and Anne felt that here her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) foot was on native heath. A wealthy manufacturer of New Brunswick had died and left part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) fortune to endow a large number of scholarships to be distributed among the various high schools and academies of the Maritime Provinces, according to their respective standings. There had been much doubt whether one would be allotted to Queen's, but the matter was settled at last, and at the end of the year the graduate who made the highest mark in English and English Literature would win the scholarship--two hundred and fifty dollars a year for four years at Redmond College. No wonder that Anne went to bed that night with tingling cheeks! <div class="bookquote">``I'll win that scholarship if hard work can do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) resolved. '' Wouldn't Matthew be proud if I got to be a B.A.? Oh, it's delightful to have ambitions. I'm so glad I have such a lot.
<p/>And there never seems to be any end to them--that's the best of it. Just as soon as you attain to one ambition you see another one glittering higher up still. It does make life so interesting.'' CHAPTER XXXV. The Winter at Queen's |ANNE'S homesickness wore off, greatly helped in the wearing by her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) weekend visits home. As long as the open weather lasted the Avonlea students went out to Carmody on the new branch railway every Friday night. Diana and several other Avonlea young folks were generally on hand to meet them and they all walked over to Avonlea in a merry party. Anne thought those Friday evening gypsyings over the autumnal hills in the crisp golden air, with the homelights of Avonlea twinkling beyond, were the best and dearest hours in the whole week. Gilbert Blythe nearly always walked with Ruby Gillis and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) satchel for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>). Ruby was a very handsome young lady, now thinking herself quite as grown up as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) really was; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) wore her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) skirts as long as her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) mother would let her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) and did her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) hair up in town, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had to take it down when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) went home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had large, bright-blue eyes, a brilliant complexion, and a plump showy figure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) laughed a great deal, was cheerful and good-tempered, and enjoyed the pleasant things of life frankly. '' But I shouldn't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was the sort of girl Gilbert would like,'' whispered Jane to Anne. Anne did not think so either, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would not have said so for the Avery scholarship. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not help thinking, too, that it would be very pleasant to have such a friend as Gilbert to jest and chatter with and exchange ideas about books and studies and ambitions.
<p/>Gilbert had ambitions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew, and Ruby Gillis did not seem the sort of person with whom such could be profitably discussed. There was no silly sentiment in Anne's ideas concerning Gilbert. Boys were to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought about them at all, merely possible good comrades. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and Gilbert had been friends she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would not have cared how many other friends he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) had nor with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) walked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had a genius for friendship; girl friends she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had in plenty; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had a vague consciousness that masculine friendship might also be a good thing to round out one's conceptions of companionship and furnish broader standpoints of judgment and comparison. Not that Anne could have put her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) feelings on the matter into just such clear definition. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought that if Gilbert had ever walked home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) from the train, over the crisp fields and along the ferny byways, they might have had many and merry and interesting conversations about the new world that was opening around them and their hopes and ambitions therein. Gilbert was a clever young fellow, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) own thoughts about things and a determination to get the best out of life and put the best into it. Ruby Gillis told Jane Andrews that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gillis</b></font>) didn't understand half the things Gilbert Blythe said; he (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>) talked just like Anne Shirley did when she (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) had a thoughtful fit on and for her (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) part she (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) didn't think it any fun to be bothering about books and that sort of thing when you didn't have to. Frank Stockley had lots more dash and go, but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Stockley</b></font>) wasn't half as good-looking as Gilbert and she (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) really couldn't decide which she (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) liked best!
<p/>In the Academy Anne gradually drew a little circle of friends about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), thoughtful, imaginative, ambitious students like herself. With the <div class="bookquote">``rose-red''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl Maynard</b></font>)</div>girl, Stella Maynard, and the <div class="bookquote">``dream girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stella Maynard/Stella</b></font>)</div>Priscilla Grant, she (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) soon became intimate, finding the latter pale spiritual-looking maiden to be full to the brim of mischief and pranks and fun, while the vivid, black-eyed Stella had a heartful of wistful dreams and fancies, as aerial and rainbow-like as Anne's own. After the Christmas holidays the Avonlea students gave up going home on Fridays and settled down to hard work. By this time all the Queen's scholars had gravitated into their own places in the ranks and the various classes had assumed distinct and settled shadings of individuality. Certain facts had become generally accepted. It was admitted that the medal contestants had practically narrowed down to three--Gilbert Blythe, Anne Shirley, and Lewis Wilson; the Avery scholarship was more doubtful, any one of a certain six being a possible winner. The bronze medal for mathematics was considered as good as won by a fat, funny little up-country boy with a bumpy forehead and a patched coat. Ruby Gillis was the handsomest girl of the year at the Academy; in the Second Year classes Stella Maynard carried off the palm for beauty, with small but critical minority in favor of Anne Shirley. Ethel Marr was admitted by all competent judges to have the most stylish modes of hair-dressing, and Jane Andrews--plain, plodding, conscientious Jane--carried off the honors in the domestic science course. Even Josie Pye attained a certain preeminence as the sharpest-tongued young lady in attendance at Queen's. So it may be fairly stated that Miss Stacy's old pupils held their own in the wider arena of the academical course. Anne worked hard and steadily.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) rivalry with Gilbert was as intense as it had ever been in Avonlea school, although it was not known in the class at large, but somehow the bitterness had gone out of it. Anne no longer wished to win for the sake of defeating Gilbert; rather, for the proud consciousness of a well-won victory over a worthy foeman. It would be worth while to win, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) no longer thought life would be insupportable if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not. In spite of lessons the students found opportunities for pleasant times. Anne spent many of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) spare hours at Beechwood and generally ate her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) Sunday dinners there and went to church with Miss Barry. The latter was, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) admitted, growing old, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) black eyes were not dim nor the vigor of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) tongue in the least abated. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) never sharpened the latter on Anne, who continued to be a prime favorite with the critical old lady. '' That Anne-girl improves all the time,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I get tired of other girls--there is such a provoking and eternal sameness about them. Anne has as many shades as a rainbow and every shade is the prettiest while it lasts. I don't know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is as amusing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was a child, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) makes me love her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and I like people who make me love them. It saves me so much trouble in making myself love them.''  (<font color='red'><b>anybody</b></font>)</div>Then, almost before anybody realized it, spring had come; out in Avonlea the Mayflowers were peeping pinkly out on the sere barrens where snow-wreaths lingered; and the <div class="bookquote">``mist of green''  (<font color='red'><b>anybody</b></font>)</div>was on the woods and in the valleys. But in Charlottetown harassed Queen's students thought and talked only of examinations.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't seem possible that the term is nearly over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``Why, last fall it seemed so long to look forward to--a whole winter of studies and classes. And here we are, with the exams looming up next week. Girls, sometimes I feel as if those exams meant everything, but when I look at the big buds swelling on those chestnut trees and the misty blue air at the end of the streets they don't seem half so important.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Andrews</b></font>)</div>Jane and Ruby and Josie, who had dropped in, did not take this view of it. To them the coming examinations were constantly very important indeed--far more important than chestnut buds or Maytime hazes. It was all very well for Anne, who was sure of passing at least, to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) moments of belittling them, but when your whole future depended on them--as the girls truly thought theirs did --you could not regard them philosophically. <div class="bookquote">``I've lost seven pounds in the last two weeks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Andrews</b></font>)</div>sighed Jane. <div class="bookquote">``It's no use to say don't worry. I will worry. Worrying helps you some--it seems as if you were doing something when you're worrying. It would be dreadful if I failed to get my license after going to Queen's all winter and spending so much money.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I don't care,'' said Josie Pye. <div class="bookquote">``If I don't pass this year I'm coming back next. My father can afford to send me. Anne, Frank Stockley says that Professor Tremaine said Gilbert Blythe was sure to get the medal and that Emily Clay would likely win the Avery scholarship.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That may make me feel badly tomorrow, Josie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>laughed Anne, <div class="bookquote">``but just now I honestly feel that as long as I know the violets are coming out all purple down in the hollow below Green Gables and that little ferns are poking their heads up in Lovers' Lane , it's not a great deal of difference whether I win the Avery or not. I've done my best and I begin to understand what is meant by the `joy of the strife.' Next to trying and winning, the best thing is trying and failing. Girls, don't talk about exams! Look at that arch of pale green sky over those houses and picture to yourself what it must look like over the purply-dark beech-woods back of Avonlea.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What are you going to wear for commencement, Jane? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby Gillis/Ruby/Gillis</b></font>)</div>asked Ruby practically. Jane and Josie both answered at once and the chatter drifted into a side eddy of fashions. But Anne, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) elbows on the window sill, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) soft cheek laid against her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) clasped hands, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes filled with visions, looked out unheedingly across city roof and spire to that glorious dome of sunset sky and wove her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) dreams of a possible future from the golden tissue of youth's own optimism. All the Beyond was hers with its possibilities lurking rosily in the oncoming years-- each year a rose of promise to be woven into an immortal chaplet. CHAPTER XXXVI. The Glory and the Dream |ON the morning when the final results of all the examinations were to be posted on the bulletin board at Queen's, Anne and Jane walked down the street together. Jane was smiling and happy; examinations were over and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was comfortably sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had made a pass at least
<p/>; further considerations troubled Jane not at all; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had no soaring ambitions and consequently was not affected with the unrest attendant thereon. For we pay a price for everything we get or take in this world; and although ambitions are well worth having, they are not to be cheaply won, but exact their dues of work and self-denial, anxiety and discouragement. Anne was pale and quiet; in ten more minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would know who had won the medal and who the Avery. Beyond those ten minutes there did not seem, just then, to be anything worth being called Time. '' Of course you'll win one of them anyhow,'' said Jane, who couldn't understand how the faculty could be so unfair as to order it otherwise. <div class="bookquote">``I have not hope of the Avery,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne. <div class="bookquote">``Everybody says Emily Clay will win it. And I'm not going to march up to that bulletin board and look at it before everybody. I haven't the moral courage. I'm going straight to the girls' dressing room. You must read the announcements and then come and tell me, Jane. And I implore you in the name of our old friendship to do it as quickly as possible. If I have failed just say so, without trying to break it gently; and whatever you do don't sympathize with me. Promise me this, Jane.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Andrews</b></font>)</div>Jane promised solemnly; but, as it happened, there was no necessity for such a promise. When they went up the entrance steps of Queen's they found the hall full of boys who were carrying Gilbert Blythe around on their shoulders and yelling at the tops of their voices, <div class="bookquote">``Hurrah for Blythe, Medalist!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gilbert/Gilbert Blythe/Blythe</b></font>)</div>For a moment Anne felt one sickening pang of defeat and disappointment. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had failed and Gilbert had won!
<p/>Well, Matthew would be sorry--he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had been so sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would win. And then! Somebody called out: <div class="bookquote">``Three cheers for Miss Shirley, winner of the Avery!''  (<font color='red'><b>Somebody</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Andrews</b></font>)</div>gasped Jane, as they fled to the girls' dressing room amid hearty cheers. '' Oh, Anne I'm so proud! Isn't it splendid?'' And then the girls were around them and Anne was the center of a laughing, congratulating group. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) shoulders were thumped and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands shaken vigorously. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was pushed and pulled and hugged and among it all she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) managed to whisper to Jane: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, won't Matthew and Marilla be pleased! I must write the news home right away. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Andrews</b></font>)</div>Commencement was the next important happening. The exercises were held in the big assembly hall of the Academy. Addresses were given, essays read, songs sung, the public award of diplomas, prizes and medals made. Matthew and Marilla were there, with eyes and ears for only one student on the platform--a tall girl in pale green, with faintly flushed cheeks and starry eyes, who read the best essay and was pointed out and whispered about as the Avery winner. <div class="bookquote">``Reckon you're glad we kept her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), Marilla?''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>whispered Matthew, speaking for the first time since he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had entered the hall, when Anne had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) essay. <div class="bookquote">``It's not the first time I've been glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>retorted Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``You do like to rub things in, Matthew Cuthbert.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Barry/Josephine/Miss Josephine Barry</b></font>)</div>Miss Barry, who was sitting behind them, leaned forward and poked Marilla in the back with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) parasol. <div class="bookquote">``Aren't you proud of that Anne-girl? I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) said. Anne went home to Avonlea with Matthew and Marilla that evening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had not been home since April and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) could not wait another day. The apple blossoms were out and the world was fresh and young.
<p/>Diana was at Green Gables to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>). In her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) own white room, where Marilla had set a flowering house rose on the window sill, Anne looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and drew a long breath of happiness. '' Oh, Diana, it's so good to be back again. It's so good to see those pointed firs coming out against the pink sky--and that white orchard and the old Snow Queen. Isn't the breath of the mint delicious? And that tea rose --why, it's a song and a hope and a prayer all in one. And it's good to see you again, Diana!'' <div class="bookquote">``I thought you liked that Stella Maynard better than me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana reproachfully. '' Josie Pye told me you did. Josie said you were infatuated with her (<font color='blue'><b>Josie</b></font>). '' Anne laughed and pelted Diana with the faded <div class="bookquote">``June lilies''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) bouquet. '' Stella Maynard is the dearest girl in the world except one and you are that one, Diana,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I love you more than ever--and I've so many things to tell you. But just now I feel as if it were joy enough to sit here and look at you. I'm tired, I think--tired of being studious and ambitious. I mean to spend at least two hours tomorrow lying out in the orchard grass, thinking of absolutely nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You've done splendidly, Anne. I suppose you won't be teaching now that you've won the Avery?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. I'm going to Redmond in September. Doesn't it seem wonderful? I'll have a brand new stock of ambition laid in by that time after three glorious, golden months of vacation. Jane and Ruby are going to teach.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Newbridge trustees have offered Jane their school already,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>said Diana. <div class="bookquote">``Gilbert Blythe is going to teach, too.

I expect he (<font color='blue'><b>Blythe</b></font>)'ll get the school here if Miss Ames decides to leave.

She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had not known this; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had expected that Gilbert would be going to Redmond also. What would she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) do without their inspiring rivalry? Would not work, even at a coeducational college with a real degree in prospect, be rather flat without her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend the enemy? The next morning at breakfast it suddenly struck Anne that Matthew was not looking well. Surely he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) was much grayer than he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had been a year before. <div class="bookquote">``Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) said hesitatingly when he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had gone out, <div class="bookquote">``is Matthew quite well?''

You look tired. I'm afraid you've been working too hard. You must take a rest, now that I'm home.

''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne had her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) good day in the companionship of the outdoor world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) never forgot that day; it was so bright and golden and fair, so free from shadow and so lavish of blossom. Anne spent some of its rich hours in the orchard; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went to the Dryad's Bubble and Willowmere and Violet Vale; she (<font color='blue'><b>Vale</b></font>) called at the manse and had a satisfying talk with Mrs. Allan; and finally in the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) went with Matthew for the cows, through Lovers' Lane to the back pasture. The woods were all gloried through with sunset and the warm splendor of it streamed down through the hill gaps in the west.

'' Just mind you that--rather than a dozen boys.
<p/>Well now, I guess it wasn't a boy that took the Avery scholarship, was it? It was a girl-- my girl--my girl that I'm proud of. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) smiled his (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) shy smile at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) went into the yard. Anne took the memory of it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) room that night and sat for a long while at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) open window, thinking of the past and dreaming of the future. Outside the Snow Queen was mistily white in the moonshine; the frogs were singing in the marsh beyond Orchard Slope. Anne always remembered the silvery, peaceful beauty and fragrant calm of that night. It was the last night before sorrow touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) life; and no life is ever quite the same again when once that cold, sanctifying touch has been laid upon it. CHAPTER XXXVII. The Reaper Whose Name Is Death |MATTHEW--Matthew--what is the matter? Matthew, are you sick? '' It was Marilla who spoke, alarm in every jerky word. Anne came through the hall, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hands full of white narcissus,--it was long before Anne could love the sight or odor of white narcissus again,--in time to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and to see Matthew standing in the porch doorway, a folded paper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) hand, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) face strangely drawn and gray. Anne dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) flowers and sprang across the kitchen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) at the same moment as Marilla. They were both too late; before they could reach him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) Matthew had fallen across the threshold. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)'s fainted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>gasped Marilla. <div class="bookquote">``Anne, run for Martin--quick, quick! He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)'s at the barn. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin</b></font>)</div>Martin, the hired man, who had just driven home from the post office, started at once for the doctor, calling at Orchard Slope on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) way to send Mr. and Mrs. Barry over.
<p/>Mrs. Lynde, who was there on an errand, came too. They found Anne and Marilla distractedly trying to restore Matthew to consciousness. Mrs. Lynde pushed them gently aside, tried his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) pulse, and then laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) ear over his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) looked at their anxious faces sorrowfully and the tears came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) eyes. '' Oh, Marilla,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) said gravely. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think--we can do anything for him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Lynde, you don't think--you can't think Matthew is-- is-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne could not say the dreadful word; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) turned sick and pallid. <div class="bookquote">``Child, yes, I'm afraid of it. Look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) face. When you've seen that look as often as I have you'll know what it means. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne looked at the still face and there beheld the seal of the Great Presence. When the doctor came he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said that death had been instantaneous and probably painless, caused in all likelihood by some sudden shock. The secret of the shock was discovered to be in the paper Matthew had held and which Martin had brought from the office that morning. It contained an account of the failure of the Abbey Bank. The news spread quickly through Avonlea, and all day friends and neighbors thronged Green Gables and came and went on errands of kindness for the dead and living. For the first time shy, quiet Matthew Cuthbert was a person of central importance; the white majesty of death had fallen on him (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) and set him (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) apart as one crowned. When the calm night came softly down over Green Gables the old house was hushed and tranquil. In the parlor lay Matthew Cuthbert in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) coffin, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) long gray hair framing his (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) placid face on which there was a little kindly smile as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) but slept, dreaming pleasant dreams.
<p/>There were flowers about him (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>)--sweet old-fashioned flowers which his (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) mother had planted in the homestead garden in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bridal days and for which Matthew had always had a secret, wordless love. Anne had gathered them and brought them to him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) anguished, tearless eyes burning in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) white face. It was the last thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>). The Barrys and Mrs. Lynde stayed with them that night. Diana, going to the east gable, where Anne was standing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) window, said gently: <div class="bookquote">``Anne dear, would you like to have me sleep with you tonight?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Diana.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne looked earnestly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend's face. <div class="bookquote">``I think you won't misunderstand me when I say I want to be alone. I'm not afraid. I haven't been alone one minute since it happened--and I want to be. I want to be quite silent and quiet and try to realize it. I can't realize it. Half the time it seems to me that Matthew can't be dead; and the other half it seems as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) must have been dead for a long time and I've had this horrible dull ache ever since. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana/Diana Barry/Barry</b></font>)</div>Diana did not quite understand. Marilla's impassioned grief, breaking all the bounds of natural reserve and lifelong habit in its stormy rush, she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) could comprehend better than Anne's tearless agony. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went away kindly, leaving Anne alone to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) first vigil with sorrow. Anne hoped that the tears would come in solitude.
<p/>It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) a terrible thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not shed a tear for Matthew, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had loved so much and who had been so kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), Matthew who had walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) last evening at sunset and was now lying in the dim room below with that awful peace on his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) brow. But no tears came at first, even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knelt by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) window in the darkness and prayed, looking up to the stars beyond the hills--no tears, only the same horrible dull ache of misery that kept on aching until she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) fell asleep, worn out with the day's pain and excitement. In the night she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) awakened, with the stillness and the darkness about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and the recollection of the day came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) like a wave of sorrow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could see Matthew's face smiling at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had smiled when they parted at the gate that last evening--she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) voice saying, '' My girl--my girl that I'm proud of. '' Then the tears came and Anne wept her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart out. Marilla heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and crept in to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``There--there--don't cry so, dearie. It can't bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) back. It--it-- isn't right to cry so. I knew that today, but I couldn't help it then. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)'d always been such a good, kind brother to me--but God knows best.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, just let me cry, Marilla,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>sobbed Anne. <div class="bookquote">``The tears don't hurt me like that ache did.

I couldn't have Diana stay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>)'s good and kind and sweet--but it's not her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) sorrow-- she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>)'s outside of it and she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) couldn't come close enough to my heart to help me. It's our sorrow--yours and mine.
<p/>Oh, Marilla, what will we do without him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We've got each other, Anne.

Oh, Anne, I know I've been kind of strict and harsh with you maybe--but you mustn't think I didn't love you as well as Matthew did, for all that. I want to tell you now when I can. It's never been easy for me to say things out of my heart, but at times like this it's easier. I love you as dear as if you were my own flesh and blood and you've been my joy and comfort ever since you came to Green Gables. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew/Matthew Cuthbert/MATTHEW</b></font>)</div>Two days afterwards they carried Matthew Cuthbert over his (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) homestead threshold and away from the fields he (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) had tilled and the orchards he (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) had loved and the trees he (<font color='blue'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>) had planted; and then Avonlea settled back to its usual placidity and even at Green Gables affairs slipped into their old groove and work was done and duties fulfilled with regularity as before, although always with the aching sense of <div class="bookquote">``loss in all familiar things.''  (<font color='red'><b>Green</b></font>)</div>Anne, new to grief, thought it almost sad that it could be so--that they could go on in the old way without Matthew. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt something like shame and remorse when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) discovered that the sunrises behind the firs and the pale pink buds opening in the garden gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) the old inrush of gladness when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw them--that Diana's visits were pleasant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) and that Diana's merry words and ways moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) to laughter and smiles--that, in brief, the beautiful world of blossom and love and friendship had lost none of its power to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) fancy and thrill her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) heart, that life still called to her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) with many insistent voices.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems like disloyalty to Matthew, somehow, to find pleasure in these things now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) has gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) said wistfully to Mrs. Allan one evening when they were together in the manse garden. <div class="bookquote">``I miss him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) so much--all the time--and yet, Mrs. Allan, the world and life seem very beautiful and interesting to me for all.

'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) is just away now; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) likes to know it just the same. I am sure we should not shut our hearts against the healing influences that nature offers us. But I can understand your feeling. I think we all experience the same thing.

Marilla was sitting on the front door-steps and Anne sat down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). The door was open behind them, held back by a big pink conch shell with hints of sea sunsets in its smooth inner convolutions.

<p/>I shall never forget it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>smiled Anne, touching the heavy braid of hair that was wound about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) shapely head. <div class="bookquote">``I laugh a little now sometimes when I think what a worry my hair used to be to me--but I don't laugh much , because it was a very real trouble then.

She (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) informed me yesterday that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) really thought it was redder than ever, or at least my black dress made it look redder, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>) asked me if people who had red hair ever got used to having it. Marilla, I've almost decided to give up trying to like Josie Pye.

The Bend in the road |MARILLA went to town the next day and returned in the evening. Anne had gone over to Orchard Slope with Diana and came back to find Marilla in the kitchen, sitting by the table with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) head leaning on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) hand. Something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) dejected attitude struck a chill to Anne's heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had never seen Marilla sit limply inert like that. <div class="bookquote">``Are you very tired, Marilla?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes--no--I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla wearily, looking up. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose I am tired but I haven't thought about it. It's not that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did you see the oculist? What did he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>asked Anne anxiously. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) examined my eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) says that if I give up all reading and sewing entirely and any kind of work that strains the eyes, and if I'm careful not to cry, and if I wear the glasses he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s given me he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thinks my eyes may not get any worse and my headaches will be cured. But if I don't he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) says I'll certainly be stone-blind in six months. Blind! Anne, just think of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>For a minute Anne, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) first quick exclamation of dismay, was silent. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not speak. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said bravely, but with a catch in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) voice: <div class="bookquote">``Marilla, don't think of it. You know he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has given you hope. If you are careful you won't lose your sight altogether; and if his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) glasses cure your headaches it will be a great thing. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't call it much hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``What am I to live for if I can't read or sew or do anything like that? I might as well be blind--or dead. And as for crying, I can't help that when I get lonesome. But there, it's no good talking about it. If you'll get me a cup of tea I'll be thankful. I'm about done out. Don't say anything about this to any one for a spell yet, anyway. I can't bear that folks should come here to question and sympathize and talk about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>When Marilla had eaten her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) lunch Anne persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to go to bed. Then Anne went herself to the east gable and sat down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) window in the darkness alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tears and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heaviness of heart. How sadly things had changed since she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had sat there the night after coming home!
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been full of hope and joy and the future had looked rosy with promise. Anne felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had lived years since then, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went to bed there was a smile on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lips and peace in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had looked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) duty courageously in the face and found it a friend--as duty ever is when we meet it frankly. One afternoon a few days later Marilla came slowly in from the front yard where she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) had been talking to a caller--a man whom Anne knew by sight as Sadler from Carmody. Anne wondered what he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmody</b></font>) could have been saying to bring that look to Marilla's face. <div class="bookquote">``What did Mr. Sadler want, Marilla?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla sat down by the window and looked at Anne. There were tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes in defiance of the oculist's prohibition and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) voice broke as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said: '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Sadler</b></font>) heard that I was going to sell Green Gables and he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) wants to buy it.'' <div class="bookquote">``Buy it! Buy Green Gables? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had heard aright. '' Oh, Marilla, you don't mean to sell Green Gables!'' <div class="bookquote">``Anne, I don't know what else is to be done. I've thought it all over. If my eyes were strong I could stay here and make out to look after things and manage, with a good hired man. But as it is I can't. I may lose my sight altogether; and anyway I'll not be fit to run things. Oh, I never thought I'd live to see the day when I'd have to sell my home. But things would only go behind worse and worse all the time, till nobody would want to buy it.
<p/>Every cent of our money went in that bank; and there's some notes Matthew gave last fall to pay. Mrs. Lynde advises me to sell the farm and board somewhere--with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) I suppose. It won't bring much--it's small and the buildings are old. But it'll be enough for me to live on I reckon. I'm thankful you're provided for with that scholarship, Anne. I'm sorry you won't have a home to come to in your vacations , that's all, but I suppose you'll manage somehow. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla broke down and wept bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``You mustn't sell Green Gables,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne resolutely. '' Oh, Anne, I wish I didn't have to. But you can see for yourself. I can't stay here alone. I'd go crazy with trouble and loneliness. And my sight would go--I know it would.'' <div class="bookquote">``You won't have to stay here alone, Marilla. I'll be with you. I'm not going to Redmond.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not going to Redmond! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) worn face from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) hands and looked at Anne. '' Why, what do you mean?'' <div class="bookquote">``Just what I say. I'm not going to take the scholarship. I decided so the night after you came home from town. You surely don't think I could leave you alone in your trouble, Marilla, after all you've done for me. I've been thinking and planning. Let me tell you my plans. Mr. Barry wants to rent the farm for next year. So you won't have any bother over that. And I'm going to teach. I've applied for the school here--but I don't expect to get it for I understand the trustees have promised it to Gilbert Blythe. But I can have the Carmody school-- Mr. Blair told me so last night at the store.
<p/>Of course that won't be quite as nice or convenient as if I had the Avonlea school. But I can board home and drive myself over to Carmody and back, in the warm weather at least. And even in winter I can come home Fridays. We'll keep a horse for that. Oh, I have it all planned out, Marilla. And I'll read to you and keep you cheered up. You sha'n't be dull or lonesome. And we'll be real cozy and happy here together, you and I.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>Marilla had listened like a woman in a dream. '' Oh, Anne, I could get on real well if you were here, I know. But I can't let you sacrifice yourself so for me. It would be terrible.'' <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne laughed merrily. <div class="bookquote">``There is no sacrifice. Nothing could be worse than giving up Green Gables--nothing could hurt me more. We must keep the dear old place. My mind is quite made up, Marilla. I'm not going to Redmond; and I am going to stay here and teach. Don't you worry about me a bit.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But your ambitions--and-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm just as ambitious as ever. Only, I've changed the object of my ambitions. I'm going to be a good teacher--and I'm going to save your eyesight. Besides, I mean to study at home here and take a little college course all by myself. Oh, I've dozens of plans, Marilla. I've been thinking them out for a week. I shall give life here my best, and I believe it will give its best to me in return. When I left Queen's my future seemed to stretch out before me like a straight road. I thought I could see along it for many a milestone. Now there is a bend in it.
<p/>I don't know what lies around the bend, but I'm going to believe that the best does. It has a fascination of its own, that bend, Marilla. I wonder how the road beyond it goes--what there is of green glory and soft, checkered light and shadows--what new landscapes--what new beauties--what curves and hills and valleys further on.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't feel as if I ought to let you give it up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, referring to the scholarship. <div class="bookquote">``But you can't prevent me. I'm sixteen and a half, `obstinate as a mule,' as Mrs. Lynde once told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>laughed Anne. '' Oh, Marilla, don't you go pitying me. I don't like to be pitied, and there is no need for it. I'm heart glad over the very thought of staying at dear Green Gables. Nobody could love it as you and I do--so we must keep it.'' <div class="bookquote">``You blessed girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marilla/Marilla Cuthbert/Miss Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Marilla, yielding. <div class="bookquote">``I feel as if you'd given me new life. I guess I ought to stick out and make you go to college-- but I know I can't, so I ain't going to try. I'll make it up to you though, Anne. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>When it became noised abroad in Avonlea that Anne Shirley had given up the idea of going to college and intended to stay home and teach there was a good deal of discussion over it. Most of the good folks, not knowing about Marilla's eyes, thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Marilla</b></font>) was foolish. Mrs. Allan did not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) told Anne so in approving words that brought tears of pleasure to the girl's eyes. Neither did good Mrs. Lynde. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) came up one evening and found Anne and Marilla sitting at the front door in the warm, scented summer dusk.
<p/>They liked to sit there when the twilight came down and the white moths flew about in the garden and the odor of mint filled the dewy air. Mrs. Rachel deposited her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) substantial person upon the stone bench by the door, behind which grew a row of tall pink and yellow hollyhocks, with a long breath of mingled weariness and relief. <div class="bookquote">``I declare I'm getting glad to sit down. I've been on my feet all day, and two hundred pounds is a good bit for two feet to carry round. It's a great blessing not to be fat, Marilla. I hope you appreciate it. Well, Anne, I hear you've given up your notion of going to college. I was real glad to hear it. You've got as much education now as a woman can be comfortable with. I don't believe in girls going to college with the men and cramming their heads full of Latin and Greek and all that nonsense.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I'm going to study Latin and Greek just the same, Mrs. Lynde,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>said Anne laughing. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to take my Arts course right here at Green Gables, and study everything that I would at college.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lynde/Mrs. Rachel/Rachel</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Lynde lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) hands in holy horror. '' Anne Shirley, you'll kill yourself.'' <div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of it. I shall thrive on it. Oh, I'm not going to overdo things. As `Josiah Allen's wife,' says, I shall be `mejum'. But I'll have lots of spare time in the long winter evenings, and I've no vocation for fancy work. I'm going to teach over at Carmody, you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know it. I guess you're going to teach right here in Avonlea. The trustees have decided to give you the school.''

(<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>cried Anne, springing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) feet in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) surprise.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I thought they had promised it to Gilbert Blythe!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So they did. But as soon as Gilbert heard that you had applied for it he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) went to them--they had a business meeting at the school last night, you know--and told them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) application, and suggested that they accept yours. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) was going to teach at White Sands. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) knew how much you wanted to stay with Marilla, and I must say I think it was real kind and thoughtful in him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) , that's what. Real self-sacrificing, too, for he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>)'ll have his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) board to pay at White Sands, and everybody knows he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>)'s got to earn his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) own way through college. So the trustees decided to take you. I was tickled to death when Thomas came home and told me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't feel that I ought to take it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>murmured Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I mean--I don't think I ought to let Gilbert make such a sacrifice for--for me.''

Of course you'll take the school. You'll get along all right, now that there are no Pyes going. Josie was the last of them, and a good thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Josie</b></font>) was, that's what. There's been some Pye or other going to Avonlea school for the last twenty years, and I guess their mission in life was to keep school teachers reminded that earth isn't their home. Bless my heart! What does all that winking and blinking at the Barry gable mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Diana is signaling for me to go over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>laughed Anne. <div class="bookquote">``You know we keep up the old custom.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Anne Shirley/Shirley</b></font>)</div>Anne ran down the clover slope like a deer, and disappeared in the firry shadows of the Haunted Wood. Mrs. Lynde looked after her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) indulgently. <div class="bookquote">``There's a good deal of the child about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) yet in some ways.''

But crispness was no longer Marilla's distinguishing characteristic. As Mrs. Lynde told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynde</b></font>) Thomas that night. '' Marilla Cuthbert has got mellow . That's what. '' Anne went to the little Avonlea graveyard the next evening to put fresh flowers on Matthew's grave and water the Scotch rosebush. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lingered there until dusk, liking the peace and calm of the little place, with its poplars whose rustle was like low, friendly speech, and its whispering grasses growing at will among the graves. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) finally left it and walked down the long hill that sloped to the Lake of Shining Waters it was past sunset and all Avonlea lay before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in a dreamlike afterlight--<div class="bookquote">``a haunt of ancient peace. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Avonlea</b></font>)</div>There was a freshness in the air as of a wind that had blown over honey-sweet fields of clover. Home lights twinkled out here and there among the homestead trees. Beyond lay the sea, misty and purple, with its haunting, unceasing murmur. The west was a glory of soft mingled hues, and the pond reflected them all in still softer shadings. The beauty of it all thrilled Anne's heart, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gratefully opened the gates of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) soul to it. '' Dear old world,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``you are very lovely, and I am glad to be alive in you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Halfway down the hill a tall lad came whistling out of a gate before the Blythe homestead.
<p/>It was Gilbert, and the whistle died on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) lips as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) recognized Anne. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) cap courteously, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) would have passed on in silence, if Anne had not stopped and held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hand. '' Gilbert,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) said, with scarlet cheeks, <div class="bookquote">``I want to thank you for giving up the school for me.
