this is a bold and venturesome undertaking and yet there must be some students of the teutonic past willing to follow even a daring guide if they may read in modern phrases of the sorrows of $son_of_hrothgar$ of the prowess of $beowulf$ and of the feelings that stirred the hearts of our forefathers in their primeval homes in order to please the larger class of readers a regular cadence has been used a measure which while retaining the essential characteristics of the original permits the reader to see ahead of him in reading perhaps every anglo saxon scholar has his own theory as to how $beowulf$ should be translated some have given us prose versions of what we believe to be a great poem is it any reflection on our honored kemble and arnold to say that their translations fail to show a layman that $beowulf$ is justly called our first epic of those translators who have used verse several have written from what would seem a mistaken point of view is it proper for instance that the grave and solemn speeches of $beowulf$ and $son_of_hrothgar$ be put in ballad measures tripping lightly and airily along or again is it fitting that the rough martial music of anglo saxon verse be interpreted to us in the smooth measures of modern blank verse do we hear what has been beautifully called the clanging tread of a warrior in mail viii of all english translations of $beowulf$ that of professor garnett alone gives any adequate idea of the chief characteristics of this great teutonic epic the measure used in the present translation is believed to be as near a reproduction of the original as modern english affords the cadences closely resemble those used by browning in some of his most striking poems
the four stresses of the anglo saxon verse are retained and as much thesis and anacrusis is allowed as is consistent with a regular cadence alliteration has been used to a large extent but it was thought that modern ears would hardly tolerate it on every line end rhyme has been used occasionally internal rhyme sporadically both have some warrant in anglo saxon poetry for end rhyme see 53 54 for internal rhyme 21 40 what gummere calls the rime giver has been studiously kept viz the first accented syllable in the second half verse always carries the alliteration and the last accented syllable alliterates only sporadically alternate alliteration is occasionally used as in the original see 61 5 no two accented syllables have been brought together except occasionally after a cã sural pause see 19 and 12 or scientifically speaking sievers c type has been avoided as not consonant with the plan of translation several of his types however constantly occur g a and a variant #â# #â# #â# xâ #â# b and a variant xâ xâ #â# xâ xâ xâ #â# a variant of #â# #â# xâ e #â# xâ #â# anacrusis gives further variety to the types used in the translation the parallelisms of the original have been faithfully preserved g 16 and 17 lord and wielder of glory 30 31 32 12 and 13 27 and 28 5 and 6 occasionally some loss has been sustained but on the other hand a gain has here and there been made
the effort has been made to give a decided flavor of archaism to the translation all words not in keeping with the spirit of the poem have been avoided again though many archaic words have been used there are none it is believed which are not found in standard modern poetry ix with these preliminary remarks it will not be amiss to give an outline of the story of the poem the story $son_of_hrothgar$ king of the danes or scyldings builds a great mead hall or palace in which he hopes to feast his liegemen and to give them presents the joy of king and retainers is however of short duration $grendel$ the monster is seized with hateful jealousy he cannot brook the sounds of joyance that reach him down in his fen dwelling near the hall oft and anon he goes to the joyous building bent on direful mischief thane after thane is ruthlessly carried off and devoured while no one is found strong enough and bold enough to cope with the monster for twelve years he persecutes $son_of_hrothgar$ and his vassals over sea a day voyage off $beowulf$ of the geats nephew of $higelac$ king of the geats hears of $grendel$ doings and of $son_of_hrothgar$ misery he resolves to crush the fell monster and relieve the aged king with fourteen chosen companions he sets sail for dane land reaching that country he soon persuades $son_of_hrothgar$ of his ability to help him the hours that elapse before night are spent in beer drinking and conversation when $son_of_hrothgar$ bedtime comes he leaves the hall in charge of $beowulf$ telling him that never before has he given to another the absolute wardship of his palace all retire to rest $beowulf$ as it were sleeping upon his arms $grendel$ comes the great march stepper bearing god anger
he seizes and kills one of the sleeping warriors then he advances towards $beowulf$ a fierce and desperate hand to hand struggle ensues no arms are used both combatants trusting to strength and hand grip $beowulf$ tears $grendel$ shoulder from its socket and the monster retreats to his den howling and yelling with agony and fury the wound is fatal the next morning at early dawn warriors in numbers flock to the hall heorot to hear the news joy is boundless glee runs high $son_of_hrothgar$ and his retainers are lavish of gratitude and of gifts $grendel$ mother however comes the next night to avenge his death she is furious and raging while $beowulf$ is sleeping in a room somewhat apart from the quarters of the other warriors she seizes one of $son_of_hrothgar$ favorite counsellors and carries him off and devours him $beowulf$ is called determined to leave heorot entirely purified he arms himself and goes down to look for the female monster after traveling through the waters many hours he meets her near the sea bottom she drags him to her den there he sees $grendel$ lying dead after a desperate and almost fatal struggle with the woman he slays her and swims upward in triumph taking with him $grendel$ head joy is renewed at heorot congratulations crowd upon the victor $son_of_hrothgar$ literally pours treasures into the lap of $beowulf$ and it is agreed among the vassals of the king that $beowulf$ will be their next liegelord $beowulf$ leaves dane land $son_of_hrothgar$ weeps and laments at his departure when the #hero# arrives in his own land $higelac$ treats him as a distinguished guest he is the #hero# of the hour $beowulf$ subsequently becomes king of his own people the geats
after he has been ruling for fifty years his own neighborhood is wofully harried by a fire spewing dragon $beowulf$ determines to kill him in the ensuing struggle both $beowulf$ and the dragon are slain the grief of the geats is inexpressible they determine however to leave nothing undone to honor the memory of their lord a great funeral pyre is built and his body is burnt then a memorial barrow is made visible from a great distance that sailors afar may be constantly reminded of the prowess of the national #hero# of geatland the poem closes with a glowing tribute to his bravery his gentleness his goodness of heart and his generosity it is the devout desire of this translator to hasten the day when the story of $beowulf$ shall be as familiar to english speaking peoples as that of the iliad $beowulf$ is our first great epic it is an epitomized history of the life of the teutonic races it brings vividly before us our forefathers of pre alfredian eras in their love of #war# of sea and of adventure my special thanks are due to professors francis a march and james a harrison for advice sympathy and assistance l hall xi abbreviations used in the notes bugge cosijn gr grein grdvtg grundtvig heyne and harrison and sharp so heyne socin kemble kl kluge mã¼llenhoff rieger sievers sw sweet b ten brink th thorpe wã¼lcker bibliography of translations arnold thomas $beowulf$ a heroic poem of the eighth century london 1876 with english translation prose botkine $beowulf$ epopã anglo saxonne havre 1877 first french translation passages occasionally omitted
