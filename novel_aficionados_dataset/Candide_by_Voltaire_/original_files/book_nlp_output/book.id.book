I was obliged to quit the castle some time after the Baron had sent you away with kicks on the backside . If a famous surgeon had not taken compassion on me , I should have died . For some time I was this surgeon 's mistress , merely out of gratitude . His wife , who was mad with jealousy , beat me every day unmercifully ; she was a fury . The surgeon was one of the ugliest of men , and I the most wretched of women , to be continually beaten for a man I did not love . You know , sir , what a dangerous thing it is for an ill-natured woman to be married to a doctor . Incensed at the behaviour of his wife , he one day gave her so effectual a remedy to cure her of a slight cold , that she died two hours after , in most horrid convulsions . The wife 's relations prosecuted the husband ; he took flight , and I was thrown into jail . My innocence would not have saved me if I had not been good-looking . The judge set me free , on condition that he succeeded the surgeon . I was soon supplanted by a rival , turned out of doors quite destitute , and obliged to continue this abominable trade , which appears so pleasant to you men , while to us women it is the utmost abyss of misery . I have come to exercise the profession at Venice . Ah ! sir , if you could only imagine what it is to be obliged to caress indifferently an old merchant , a lawyer , a monk , a gondolier , an abbé , to be exposed to abuse and insults ; to be often reduced to borrowing a petticoat , only to go and have it raised by a disagreeable man ; to be robbed by one of what one has earned from another ; to be subject to the extortions of the officers of justice ; and to have in prospect only a frightful old age , a hospital , and a dung-hill ; you would conclude that I am one of the most unhappy creatures in the world .

I should have been burnt , but you may remember it rained exceedingly hard when they were going to roast me ; the storm was so violent that they despaired of lighting the fire , so I was hanged because they could do no better . A surgeon purchased my body , carried me home , and dissected me . He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula . One could not have been worse hanged than I was . The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon , and knew how to burn people marvellously well , but he was not accustomed to hanging . The cord was wet and did not slip properly , and besides it was badly tied ; in short , I still drew my breath , when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back , and imagining that he had been dissecting the devil he ran away , dying with fear , and fell down the staircase in his flight . His wife , hearing the noise , flew from the next room . She saw me stretched out upon the table with my crucial incision . She was seized with yet greater fear than her husband , fled , and tumbled over him . When they came to themselves a little , I heard the wife say to her husband : ` My dear , how could you take it into your head to dissect a heretic ? Do you not know that these people always have the devil in their bodies ? I will go and fetch a priest this minute to exorcise him . ' At this proposal I shuddered , and mustering up what little courage I had still remaining I cried out aloud , ` Have mercy on me ! ' At length the Portuguese barber plucked up his spirits . He sewed up my wounds ; his wife even nursed me . I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days . The barber found me a place as lackey to a knight of Malta who was going to Venice , but finding that my master had no money to pay me my wages I entered the service of a Venetian merchant , and went with him to Constantinople . One day I took it into my head to step into a mosque , where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters . Her bosom was uncovered , and between her breasts she had a beautiful bouquet of tulips , roses , anemones , ranunculus , hyacinths , and auriculas . She dropped her bouquet ; I picked it up , and presented it to her with a profound reverence . I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry , and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help . They carried me before the cadi , who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys . I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron . On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles , five Neapolitan priests , and two monks from Corfu , who told us similar adventures happened daily . The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I , and I insisted that it was far more innocent to take up a bouquet and place it again on a woman 's bosom than to be found stark naked with an Ichoglan . We were continually disputing , and received twenty lashes with a bull 's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley , and you were good enough to ransom us .
