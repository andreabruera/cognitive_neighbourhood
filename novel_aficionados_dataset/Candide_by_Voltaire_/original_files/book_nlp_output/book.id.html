PUBLISHERS NEW YORK BONI & LIVERIGHT, INC.. Printed in the United States of America INTRODUCTION Ever since 1759, when Voltaire wrote <div class="bookquote">``Candide''  (<font color='red'><b>Voltaire/VOLTAIRE</b></font>)</div>in ridicule of the notion that this is the best of all possible worlds, this world has been a gayer place for readers. Voltaire wrote it in three days, and five or six generations have found that its laughter does not grow old. '' Candide'' has not aged. Yet how different the book would have looked if Voltaire had written it a hundred and fifty years later than 1759. It would have been, among other things, a book of sights and sounds. A modern writer would have tried to catch and fix in words some of those Atlantic changes which broke the Atlantic monotony of that voyage from Cadiz to Buenos Ayres. When Martin and Candide were sailing the length of the Mediterranean we should have had a contrast between naked scarped Balearic cliffs and headlands of Calabria in their mists.
<p/>We should have had quarter distances, far horizons, the altering silhouettes of an Ionian island. Colored birds would have filled Paraguay with their silver or acid cries. Dr. Pangloss, to prove the existence of design in the universe, says that noses were made to carry spectacles, and so we have spectacles. A modern satirist would not try to paint with Voltaire's quick brush the doctrine that he (<font color='blue'><b>satirist</b></font>) wanted to expose. And he (<font color='blue'><b>satirist</b></font>) would choose a more complicated doctrine than Dr. Pangloss's optimism, would study it more closely, feel his (<font color='blue'><b>satirist</b></font>) destructive way about it with a more learned and caressing malice. His (<font color='blue'><b>satirist</b></font>) attack, stealthier, more flexible and more patient than Voltaire's, would call upon us, especially when his (<font color='blue'><b>satirist</b></font>) learning got a little out of control, to be more than patient. Now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>satirist</b></font>) would bore us. '' Candide'' never bored anybody except William Wordsworth. Voltaire's men and women point his (<font color='blue'><b>Wordsworth</b></font>) case against optimism by starting high and falling low. A modern could not go about it after this fashion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wordsworth</b></font>) would not plunge his (<font color='blue'><b>Wordsworth</b></font>) people into an unfamiliar misery. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wordsworth</b></font>) would just keep them in the misery they were born to. But such an account of Voltaire's procedure is as misleading as the plaster cast of a dance. Look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wordsworth</b></font>) procedure again. Mademoiselle Cunégonde, the illustrious Westphalian, sprung from a family that could prove seventy-one quarterings, descends and descends until we find her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) earning her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) keep by washing dishes in the Propontis. The aged faithful attendant, victim of a hundred acts of rape by negro pirates, remembers that she (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) is the daughter of a pope, and that in honor of her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) approaching marriage with a Prince of Massa-Carrara all Italy wrote sonnets of which not one was passable.
<p/>We do not need to know French literature before Voltaire in order to feel, although the lurking parody may escape us, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) is poking fun at us and at himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) laughter at his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own methods grows more unmistakable at the last, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) caricatures them by casually assembling six fallen monarchs in an inn at Venice. A modern assailant of optimism would arm himself with social pity. There is no social pity in <div class="bookquote">``Candide. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Voltaire/VOLTAIRE</b></font>)</div>Voltaire, whose light touch on familiar institutions opens them and reveals their absurdity, likes to remind us that the slaughter and pillage and murder which Candide witnessed among the Bulgarians was perfectly regular, having been conducted according to the laws and usages of war. Had Voltaire lived to-day he (<font color='blue'><b>assailant</b></font>) would have done to poverty what he (<font color='blue'><b>assailant</b></font>) did to war. Pitying the poor, he (<font color='blue'><b>assailant</b></font>) would have shown us poverty as a ridiculous anachronism, and both the ridicule and the pity would have expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>assailant</b></font>) indignation. Almost any modern, essaying a philosophic tale, would make it long. <div class="bookquote">``Candide''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>is only a <div class="bookquote">``Hamlet''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and a half long. It would hardly have been shorter if Voltaire had spent three months on it, instead of those three days. A conciseness to be matched in English by nobody except Pope, who can say a plagiarizing enemy <div class="bookquote">``steals much, spends little, and has nothing left,''  (<font color='red'><b>a enemy</b></font>)</div>a conciseness which Pope toiled and sweated for, came as easy as wit to Voltaire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) can afford to be witty, parenthetically, by the way, prodigally, without saving, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) knows there is more wit where that came from. One of Max Beerbohm's cartoons shows us the young Twentieth Century going at top speed, and watched by two of his (<font color='blue'><b>Max</b></font>) predecessors.
<p/>Underneath is this legend: <div class="bookquote">``The Grave Misgivings of the Nineteenth Century, and the Wicked Amusement of the Eighteenth, in Watching the Progress -LRB-or whatever it is-RRB- of the Twentieth. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Voltaire/VOLTAIRE</b></font>)</div>This Eighteenth Century snuff-taking and malicious, is like Voltaire, who nevertheless must know, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Max</b></font>) happens to think of it, that not yet in the Twentieth Century, not for all its speed mania, has any one come near to equalling the speed of a prose tale by Voltaire. <div class="bookquote">``Candide''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>is a full book. It is filled with mockery, with inventiveness, with things as concrete as things to eat and coins, it has time for the neatest intellectual clickings, it is never hurried, and it moves with the most amazing rapidity. It has the rapidity of high spirits playing a game. The dry high spirits of this destroyer of optimism make most optimists look damp and depressed. Contemplation of the stupidity which deems happiness possible almost made Voltaire happy. His (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) attack on optimism is one of the gayest books in the world. Gaiety has been scattered everywhere up and down its pages by Voltaire's lavish hand, by his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) thin fingers. Many propagandist satirical books have been written with <div class="bookquote">``Candide''  (<font color='red'><b>propagandist</b></font>)</div>in mind, but not too many. To-day, especially, when new faiths are changing the structure of the world, faiths which are still plastic enough to be deformed by every disciple, each disciple for himself, and which have not yet received the final deformation known as universal acceptance, to-day <div class="bookquote">``Candide''  (<font color='red'><b>each disciple</b></font>)</div>is an inspiration to every narrative satirist who hates one of these new faiths, or hates every interpretation of it but his (<font color='blue'><b>satirist</b></font>) own. Either hatred will serve as a motive to satire. That is why the present is one of the right moments to republish <div class="bookquote">``Candide.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hope it will inspire younger men and women, the only ones who can be inspired, to have a try at Theodore, or Militarism; Jane, or Pacifism; at So-and-So, the Pragmatist or the Freudian. And I hope, too, that they will without trying hold their pens with an eighteenth century lightness, not inappropriate to a philosophic tale. In Voltaire's fingers, as Anatole France has said, the pen runs and laughs. PHILIP LITTELL. CONTENTS CHAPTER PAGE I.

The Conclusion 161 -LSB-Illustration: VOLTAIRE'S CANDIDE-RSB- CANDIDE I HOW CANDIDE WAS BROUGHT UP IN A MAGNIFICENT CASTLE, AND HOW HE (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) WAS EXPELLED THENCE. In a castle of Westphalia, belonging to the Baron of Thunder-ten-Tronckh, lived a youth, whom nature had endowed with the most gentle manners. His (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) countenance was a true picture of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) soul. He (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) combined a true judgment with simplicity of spirit, which was the reason, I apprehend, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) being called Candide. The old servants of the family suspected him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) to have been the son of the Baron's sister, by a good, honest gentleman of the neighborhood, whom that young lady would never marry because he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been able to prove only seventy-one quarterings, the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) genealogical tree having been lost through the injuries of time.
<p/>The Baron was one of the most powerful lords in Westphalia, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) castle had not only a gate, but windows. His (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) great hall, even, was hung with tapestry. All the dogs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) farm-yards formed a pack of hounds at need; his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) grooms were his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) huntsmen; and the curate of the village was his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) grand almoner. They called him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``My Lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and laughed at all his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) stories. The Baron's lady weighed about three hundred and fifty pounds, and was therefore a person of great consideration, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did the honours of the house with a dignity that commanded still greater respect. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughter Cunegonde was seventeen years of age, fresh-coloured, comely, plump, and desirable. The Baron's son seemed to be in every respect worthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) father. The Preceptor Pangloss-LSB-1-RSB- was the oracle of the family, and little Candide heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) lessons with all the good faith of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) age and character. Pangloss was professor of metaphysico-theologico-cosmolo-nigology. He (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) proved admirably that there is no effect without a cause, and that, in this best of all possible worlds, the Baron's castle was the most magnificent of castles, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) lady the best of all possible Baronesses. <div class="bookquote">``It is demonstrable,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that things cannot be otherwise than as they are; for all being created for an end, all is necessarily for the best end. Observe, that the nose has been formed to bear spectacles--thus we have spectacles. Legs are visibly designed for stockings--and we have stockings. Stones were made to be hewn, and to construct castles--therefore my lord has a magnificent castle; for the greatest baron in the province ought to be the best lodged. Pigs were made to be eaten--therefore we eat pork all the year round.
<p/>Consequently they who assert that all is well have said a foolish thing, they should have said all is for the best.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Candide listened attentively and believed innocently; for he (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>) thought Miss Cunegonde extremely beautiful, though he (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>) never had the courage to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>) so. He (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>) concluded that after the happiness of being born of Baron of Thunder-ten-Tronckh, the second degree of happiness was to be Miss Cunegonde, the third that of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>) every day, and the fourth that of hearing Master Pangloss, the greatest philosopher of the whole province, and consequently of the whole world. One day Cunegonde, while walking near the castle, in a little wood which they called a park, saw between the bushes, Dr. Pangloss giving a lesson in experimental natural philosophy to her (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>) mother's chamber-maid, a little brown wench, very pretty and very docile. As Miss Cunegonde had a great disposition for the sciences, she (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>) breathlessly observed the repeated experiments of which she (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>) was a witness; she (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>) clearly perceived the force of the Doctor's reasons, the effects, and the causes; she (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>) turned back greatly flurried, quite pensive, and filled with the desire to be learned; dreaming that she (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>) might well be a sufficient reason for young Candide, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>) met Candide on reaching the castle and blushed; Candide blushed also; she (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) good morrow in a faltering tone, and Candide spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>) without knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said. The next day after dinner, as they went from table, Cunegonde and Candide found themselves behind a screen; Cunegonde let fall her (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>) handkerchief, Candide picked it up , she (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) innocently by the hand, the youth as innocently kissed the young lady's hand with particular vivacity, sensibility, and grace; their lips met, their eyes sparkled, their knees trembled, their hands strayed.
<p/>Baron Thunder-ten-Tronckh passed near the screen and beholding this cause and effect chased Candide from the castle with great kicks on the backside; Cunegonde fainted away; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was boxed on the ears by the Baroness, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) came to herself; and all was consternation in this most magnificent and most agreeable of all possible castles. II WHAT BECAME OF CANDIDE AMONG THE BULGARIANS. Candide, driven from terrestrial paradise, walked a long while without knowing where, weeping, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) eyes to heaven, turning them often towards the most magnificent of castles which imprisoned the purest of noble young ladies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) lay down to sleep without supper, in the middle of a field between two furrows. The snow fell in large flakes. Next day Candide, all benumbed, dragged himself towards the neighbouring town which was called Waldberghofftrarbk-dikdorff, having no money, dying of hunger and fatigue, he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) stopped sorrowfully at the door of an inn. Two men dressed in blue observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>). '' Comrade,'' said one, <div class="bookquote">``here is a well-built young fellow, and of proper height. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Comrade</b></font>)</div>They went up to Candide and very civilly invited him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to dinner. <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Candide, with a most engaging modesty, <div class="bookquote">``you do me great honour, but I have not wherewithal to pay my share.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said one of the blues to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``people of your appearance and of your merit never pay anything: are you not five feet five inches high?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, that is my height,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>answered he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), making a low bow. <div class="bookquote">``Come, sir, seat yourself; not only will we pay your reckoning, but we will never suffer such a man as you to want money; men are only born to assist one another.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide; <div class="bookquote">``this is what I was always taught by Mr. Pangloss, and I see plainly that all is for the best. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>They begged of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) to accept a few crowns. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) took them, and wished to give them his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) note; they refused; they seated themselves at table. '' Love you not deeply?'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>answered he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I deeply love Miss Cunegonde.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div>said one of the gentlemen, <div class="bookquote">``we ask you if you do not deeply love the King of the Bulgarians?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``for I have never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What! he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) is the best of kings, and we must drink his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) health.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh! very willingly, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) drank. <div class="bookquote">``That is enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>they tell him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Now you are the help, the support, the defender, the hero of the Bulgarians. Your fortune is made, and your glory is assured. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Instantly they fettered him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>), and carried him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) away to the regiment. There he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was made to wheel about to the right, and to the left, to draw his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) rammer, to return his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) rammer, to present, to fire, to march, and they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) thirty blows with a cudgel. The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) exercise a little less badly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) received but twenty blows. The day following they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) only ten, and he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was regarded by his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) comrades as a prodigy. Candide, all stupefied, could not yet very well realise how he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was a hero. He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) resolved one fine day in spring to go for a walk, marching straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>), believing that it was a privilege of the human as well as of the animal species to make use of their legs as they pleased.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) had advanced two leagues when he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was overtaken by four others, heroes of six feet, who bound him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) and carried him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) to a dungeon. He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was asked which he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) would like the best, to be whipped six-and-thirty times through all the regiment, or to receive at once twelve balls of lead in his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) brain. He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) vainly said that human will is free, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) chose neither the one nor the other. He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was forced to make a choice; he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) determined, in virtue of that gift of God called liberty, to run the gauntlet six-and-thirty times. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) bore this twice. The regiment was composed of two thousand men; that composed for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) four thousand strokes, which laid bare all his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) muscles and nerves, from the nape of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) neck quite down to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) rump. As they were going to proceed to a third whipping, Candide, able to bear no more, begged as a favour that they would be so good as to shoot him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) obtained this favour; they bandaged his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) kneel down. The King of the Bulgarians passed at this moment and ascertained the nature of the crime. As he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had great talent, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) understood from all that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) learnt of Candide that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was a young metaphysician, extremely ignorant of the things of this world, and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) accorded him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) pardon with a clemency which will bring him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) praise in all the journals, and throughout all ages. An able surgeon cured Candide in three weeks by means of emollients taught by Dioscorides. He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) had already a little skin, and was able to march when the King of the Bulgarians gave battle to the King of the Abares.-LSB-2-RSB- III HOW CANDIDE MADE HIS (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) ESCAPE FROM THE BULGARIANS, AND WHAT AFTERWARDS BECAME OF HIM.
<p/>There was never anything so gallant, so spruce, so brilliant, and so well disposed as the two armies. Trumpets, fifes, hautboys, drums, and cannon made music such as Hell itself had never heard. The cannons first of all laid flat about six thousand men on each side; the muskets swept away from this best of worlds nine or ten thousand ruffians who infested its surface. The bayonet was also a sufficient reason for the death of several thousands. The whole might amount to thirty thousand souls. Candide, who trembled like a philosopher, hid himself as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) could during this heroic butchery. At length, while the two kings were causing Te Deum to be sung each in his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) own camp, Candide resolved to go and reason elsewhere on effects and causes. He (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) passed over heaps of dead and dying, and first reached a neighbouring village; it was in cinders, it was an Abare village which the Bulgarians had burnt according to the laws of war. Here, old men covered with wounds, beheld their wives, hugging their children to their bloody breasts, massacred before their faces; there, their daughters, disembowelled and breathing their last after having satisfied the natural wants of Bulgarian heroes; while others, half burnt in the flames, begged to be despatched. The earth was strewed with brains, arms, and legs. Candide fled quickly to another village; it belonged to the Bulgarians; and the Abarian heroes had treated it in the same way. Candide, walking always over palpitating limbs or across ruins, arrived at last beyond the seat of war, with a few provisions in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) knapsack, and Miss Cunegonde always in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) heart.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) provisions failed him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) arrived in Holland; but having heard that everybody was rich in that country, and that they were Christians, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) did not doubt but he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) should meet with the same treatment from them as he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had met with in the Baron's castle, before Miss Cunegonde's bright eyes were the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) expulsion thence. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) asked alms of several grave-looking people, who all answered him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), that if he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) continued to follow this trade they would confine him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to the house of correction, where he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) should be taught to get a living. The next he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) addressed was a man who had been haranguing a large assembly for a whole hour on the subject of charity. But the orator, looking askew, said: <div class="bookquote">``What are you doing here? Are you for the good cause?''  (<font color='red'><b>the orator</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There can be no effect without a cause,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>modestly answered Candide; <div class="bookquote">``the whole is necessarily concatenated and arranged for the best. It was necessary for me to have been banished from the presence of Miss Cunegonde, to have afterwards run the gauntlet, and now it is necessary I should beg my bread until I learn to earn it; all this cannot be otherwise.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>the orator</b></font>)</div>said the orator to him (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``do you believe the Pope to be Anti-Christ?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have not heard it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Candide; <div class="bookquote">``but whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) be, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) be not, I want bread.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thou dost not deserve to eat,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other. '' Begone, rogue; begone, wretch; do not come near me again. '' The orator's wife, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head out of the window, and spying a man that doubted whether the Pope was Anti-Christ, poured over him (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) a full.... Oh, heavens! to what excess does religious zeal carry the ladies.
<p/>A man who had never been christened, a good Anabaptist, named James, beheld the cruel and ignominious treatment shown to one of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) brethren, an unfeathered biped with a rational soul, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) home, cleaned him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), gave him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) bread and beer, presented him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) with two florins, and even wished to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) the manufacture of Persian stuffs which they make in Holland. Candide, almost prostrating himself before him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), cried: <div class="bookquote">``Master Pangloss has well said that all is for the best in this world, for I am infinitely more touched by your extreme generosity than with the inhumanity of that gentleman in the black coat and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lady. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The next day, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) took a walk, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) met a beggar all covered with scabs, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes diseased, the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) nose eaten away, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mouth distorted, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) teeth black, choking in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) throat, tormented with a violent cough, and spitting out a tooth at each effort. IV HOW CANDIDE FOUND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) OLD MASTER PANGLOSS, AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM. Candide, yet more moved with compassion than with horror, gave to this shocking beggar the two florins which he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) had received from the honest Anabaptist James. The spectre looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) very earnestly, dropped a few tears, and fell upon his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) neck. Candide recoiled in disgust. '' Alas!'' said one wretch to the other, <div class="bookquote">``do you no longer know your dear Pangloss?''  (<font color='red'><b>wretch</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What do I hear? You, my dear master! you in this terrible plight! What misfortune has happened to you? Why are you no longer in the most magnificent of castles? What has become of Miss Cunegonde, the pearl of girls, and nature's masterpiece?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am so weak that I cannot stand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>said Pangloss.
<p/>Upon which Candide carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Pangloss</b></font>) to the Anabaptist's stable, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Pangloss</b></font>) a crust of bread. As soon as Pangloss had refreshed himself a little: <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``Cunegonde?''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Pangloss</b></font>) is dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the other. Candide fainted at this word; his (<font color='blue'><b>Pangloss</b></font>) friend recalled his (<font color='blue'><b>Pangloss</b></font>) senses with a little bad vinegar which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pangloss</b></font>) found by chance in the stable. Candide reopened his (<font color='blue'><b>Pangloss</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Cunegonde is dead! Ah, best of worlds, where art thou? But of what illness did she (<font color='blue'><b>Pangloss</b></font>) die? Was it not for grief, upon seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Pangloss</b></font>) father kick me out of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) magnificent castle?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>said Pangloss, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Pangloss</b></font>) was ripped open by the Bulgarian soldiers, after having been violated by many; they broke the Baron's head for attempting to defend her (<font color='blue'><b>Pangloss</b></font>); my lady, her (<font color='blue'><b>Pangloss</b></font>) mother, was cut in pieces; my poor pupil was served just in the same manner as his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) sister; and as for the castle, they have not left one stone upon another, not a barn, nor a sheep, nor a duck, nor a tree; but we have had our revenge, for the Abares have done the very same thing to a neighbouring barony, which belonged to a Bulgarian lord.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>At this discourse Candide fainted again; but coming to himself, and having said all that it became him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) to say, inquired into the cause and effect, as well as into the sufficient reason that had reduced Pangloss to so miserable a plight. '' Alas!'' said the other, <div class="bookquote">``it was love; love, the comfort of the human species, the preserver of the universe, the soul of all sensible beings, love, tender love.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Alas!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``I know this love, that sovereign of hearts, that soul of our souls; yet it never cost me more than a kiss and twenty kicks on the backside.
<p/>How could this beautiful cause produce in you an effect so abominable? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>Pangloss made answer in these terms: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear Candide, you remember Paquette, that pretty wench who waited on our noble Baroness; in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) arms I tasted the delights of paradise, which produced in me those hell torments with which you see me devoured; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was infected with them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) is perhaps dead of them. This present Paquette received of a learned Grey Friar, who had traced it to its source; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paquette</b></font>) had had it of an old countess, who had received it from a cavalry captain, who owed it to a marchioness, who took it from a page, who had received it from a Jesuit, who when a novice had it in a direct line from one of the companions of Christopher Columbus.-LSB-3-RSB- For my part I shall give it to nobody, I am dying.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Pangloss!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Candide, <div class="bookquote">``what a strange genealogy! Is not the Devil the original stock of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>this man</b></font>)</div>replied this great man, <div class="bookquote">``it was a thing unavoidable, a necessary ingredient in the best of worlds; for if Columbus had not in an island of America caught this disease, which contaminates the source of life, frequently even hinders generation, and which is evidently opposed to the great end of nature, we should have neither chocolate nor cochineal. We are also to observe that upon our continent, this distemper is like religious controversy, confined to a particular spot. The Turks, the Indians, the Persians, the Chinese, the Siamese, the Japanese, know nothing of it; but there is a sufficient reason for believing that they will know it in their turn in a few centuries.
<p/>In the meantime, it has made marvellous progress among us, especially in those great armies composed of honest well-disciplined hirelings, who decide the destiny of states; for we may safely affirm that when an army of thirty thousand men fights another of an equal number, there are about twenty thousand of them p-x-d on each side.''  (<font color='red'><b>this man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, this is wonderful!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``but you must get cured.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Alas! how can I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>said Pangloss, <div class="bookquote">``I have not a farthing, my friend, and all over the globe there is no letting of blood or taking a glister, without paying, or somebody paying for you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>These last words determined Candide; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) went and flung himself at the feet of the charitable Anabaptist James, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) so touching a picture of the state to which his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) friend was reduced, that the good man did not scruple to take Dr. Pangloss into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house, and had him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cured at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expense. In the cure Pangloss lost only an eye and an ear. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote well, and knew arithmetic perfectly. The Anabaptist James made him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) bookkeeper. At the end of two months, being obliged to go to Lisbon about some mercantile affairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) took the two philosophers with him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) ship. Pangloss explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) how everything was so constituted that it could not be better. James was not of this opinion. <div class="bookquote">``It is more likely,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``mankind have a little corrupted nature, for they were not born wolves, and they have become wolves; God has given them neither cannon of four-and-twenty pounders, nor bayonets; and yet they have made cannon and bayonets to destroy one another. Into this account I might throw not only bankrupts, but Justice which seizes on the effects of bankrupts to cheat the creditors.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All this was indispensable,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the one-eyed doctor, <div class="bookquote">``for private misfortunes make the general good, so that the more private misfortunes there are the greater is the general good. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>While he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) reasoned, the sky darkened, the winds blew from the four quarters, and the ship was assailed by a most terrible tempest within sight of the port of Lisbon. V TEMPEST, SHIPWRECK, EARTHQUAKE, AND WHAT BECAME OF DOCTOR PANGLOSS, CANDIDE, AND JAMES THE ANABAPTIST. Half dead of that inconceivable anguish which the rolling of a ship produces, one-half of the passengers were not even sensible of the danger. The other half shrieked and prayed. The sheets were rent, the masts broken, the vessel gaped. Work who would, no one heard, no one commanded. The Anabaptist being upon deck bore a hand; when a brutish sailor struck him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) roughly and laid him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) sprawling; but with the violence of the blow he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) himself tumbled head foremost overboard, and stuck upon a piece of the broken mast. Honest James ran to his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) assistance, hauled him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) up, and from the effort he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) made was precipitated into the sea in sight of the sailor, who left him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) to perish, without deigning to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>). Candide drew near and saw his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) benefactor, who rose above the water one moment and was then swallowed up for ever. He (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was just going to jump after him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>), but was prevented by the philosopher Pangloss, who demonstrated to him (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) that the Bay of Lisbon had been made on purpose for the Anabaptist to be drowned. While he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) was proving this  priori , the ship foundered; all perished except Pangloss, Candide, and that brutal sailor who had drowned the good Anabaptist. The villain swam safely to the shore, while Pangloss and Candide were borne thither upon a plank.
<p/>As soon as they recovered themselves a little they walked toward Lisbon. They had some money left, with which they hoped to save themselves from starving, after they had escaped drowning. Scarcely had they reached the city, lamenting the death of their benefactor, when they felt the earth tremble under their feet. The sea swelled and foamed in the harbour, and beat to pieces the vessels riding at anchor. Whirlwinds of fire and ashes covered the streets and public places; houses fell, roofs were flung upon the pavements, and the pavements were scattered. Thirty thousand inhabitants of all ages and sexes were crushed under the ruins.-LSB-4-RSB- The sailor, whistling and swearing, said there was booty to be gained here. <div class="bookquote">``What can be the sufficient reason of this phenomenon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>said Pangloss. <div class="bookquote">``This is the Last Day!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Candide. The sailor ran among the ruins, facing death to find money; finding it, he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) took it, got drunk, and having slept himself sober, purchased the favours of the first good-natured wench whom he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) met on the ruins of the destroyed houses, and in the midst of the dying and the dead. Pangloss pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) by the sleeve. '' My friend,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``this is not right. You sin against the universal reason ; you choose your time badly.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``S'blood and fury! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered the other; <div class="bookquote">``I am a sailor and born at Batavia. Four times have I trampled upon the crucifix in four voyages to Japan-LSB-5-RSB-; a fig for thy universal reason. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Some falling stones had wounded Candide. He (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) lay stretched in the street covered with rubbish. '' Alas!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) to Pangloss, <div class="bookquote">``get me a little wine and oil; I am dying.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This concussion of the earth is no new thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>answered Pangloss. ''
<p/>The city of Lima, in America, experienced the same convulsions last year; the same cause, the same effects; there is certainly a train of sulphur under ground from Lima to Lisbon.'' <div class="bookquote">``Nothing more probable,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide; <div class="bookquote">``but for the love of God a little oil and wine.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How, probable?''  (<font color='red'><b>the philosopher</b></font>)</div>replied the philosopher. <div class="bookquote">``I maintain that the point is capable of being demonstrated.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>Candide fainted away, and Pangloss fetched him (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) some water from a neighbouring fountain. The following day they rummaged among the ruins and found provisions, with which they repaired their exhausted strength. After this they joined with others in relieving those inhabitants who had escaped death. Some, whom they had succoured, gave them as good a dinner as they could in such disastrous circumstances; true, the repast was mournful, and the company moistened their bread with tears; but Pangloss consoled them, assuring them that things could not be otherwise. '' For,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``all that is is for the best. If there is a volcano at Lisbon it cannot be elsewhere. It is impossible that things should be other than they are; for everything is right. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>A little man dressed in black, Familiar of the Inquisition, who sat by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), politely took up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) word and said: <div class="bookquote">``Apparently, then, sir, you do not believe in original sin; for if all is for the best there has then been neither Fall nor punishment.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I humbly ask your Excellency's pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>answered Pangloss, still more politely; <div class="bookquote">``for the Fall and curse of man necessarily entered into the system of the best of worlds.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Familiar, <div class="bookquote">``you do not then believe in liberty?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your Excellency will excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>said Pangloss; <div class="bookquote">``liberty is consistent with absolute necessity, for it was necessary we should be free; for, in short, the determinate will--''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>Pangloss was in the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sentence, when the Familiar beckoned to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) footman, who gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a glass of wine from Porto or Opporto. VI HOW THE PORTUGUESE MADE A BEAUTIFUL AUTO-DA-FÉ, TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER EARTHQUAKES; AND HOW CANDIDE WAS PUBLICLY WHIPPED. After the earthquake had destroyed three-fourths of Lisbon, the sages of that country could think of no means more effectual to prevent utter ruin than to give the people a beautiful auto-da-fé -LSB-6-RSB-; for it had been decided by the University of Coimbra, that the burning of a few people alive by a slow fire, and with great ceremony, is an infallible secret to hinder the earth from quaking. In consequence hereof, they had seized on a Biscayner, convicted of having married his (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) godmother, and on two Portuguese, for rejecting the bacon which larded a chicken they were eating-LSB-7-RSB-; after dinner, they came and secured Dr. Pangloss, and his (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) disciple Candide, the one for speaking his (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) mind, the other for having listened with an air of approbation. They were conducted to separate apartments, extremely cold, as they were never incommoded by the sun. Eight days after they were dressed in san-benitos -LSB-8-RSB- and their heads ornamented with paper mitres. The mitre and san-benito belonging to Candide were painted with reversed flames and with devils that had neither tails nor claws; but Pangloss's devils had claws and tails and the flames were upright. They marched in procession thus habited and heard a very pathetic sermon, followed by fine church music.
<p/>Candide was whipped in cadence while they were singing; the Biscayner, and the two men who had refused to eat bacon, were burnt; and Pangloss was hanged, though that was not the custom. The same day the earth sustained a most violent concussion. Candide, terrified, amazed, desperate, all bloody, all palpitating, said to himself: <div class="bookquote">``If this is the best of possible worlds, what then are the others? Well, if I had been only whipped I could put up with it, for I experienced that among the Bulgarians; but oh, my dear Pangloss! thou greatest of philosophers, that I should have seen you hanged, without knowing for what! Oh, my dear Anabaptist, thou best of men, that thou should`st have been drowned in the very harbour! Oh, Miss Cunegonde, thou pearl of girls! that thou should`st have had thy belly ripped open!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulgarians</b></font>) was musing, scarce able to stand, preached at, whipped, absolved, and blessed, when an old woman accosted him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulgarians</b></font>) saying: <div class="bookquote">``My son, take courage and follow me.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>VII HOW THE OLD WOMAN TOOK CARE OF CANDIDE, AND HOW HE (<font color='blue'><b>Bulgarians</b></font>) FOUND THE OBJECT HE (<font color='blue'><b>Bulgarians</b></font>) LOVED. Candide did not take courage, but followed the old woman to a decayed house, where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulgarians</b></font>) a pot of pomatum to anoint his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulgarians</b></font>) sores, showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulgarians</b></font>) a very neat little bed, with a suit of clothes hanging up, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulgarians</b></font>) something to eat and drink. '' Eat, drink, sleep,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and may our lady of Atocha,-LSB-9-RSB- the great St. Anthony of Padua, and the great St. James of Compostella, receive you under their protection. I shall be back to-morrow.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Candide, amazed at all he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had suffered and still more with the charity of the old woman, wished to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not my hand you must kiss,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman; <div class="bookquote">``I shall be back to-morrow. Anoint yourself with the pomatum, eat and sleep.''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>Candide, notwithstanding so many disasters, ate and slept. The next morning the old woman brought him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) breakfast, looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) back, and rubbed it herself with another ointment: in like manner she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) dinner; and at night she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) returned with his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) supper. The day following she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went through the very same ceremonies. <div class="bookquote">``Who are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide; <div class="bookquote">``who has inspired you with so much goodness? What return can I make you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div>The good woman made no answer; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) returned in the evening, but brought no supper. '' Come with me,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and say nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) by the arm, and walked with him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) about a quarter of a mile into the country; they arrived at a lonely house, surrounded with gardens and canals. The old woman knocked at a little door, it opened, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) led Candide up a private staircase into a small apartment richly furnished. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) on a brocaded sofa, shut the door and went away. Candide thought himself in a dream; indeed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had been dreaming unluckily all his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) life, and that the present moment was the only agreeable part of it all. The old woman returned very soon, supporting with difficulty a trembling woman of a majestic figure, brilliant with jewels, and covered with a veil. <div class="bookquote">``Take off that veil,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman to Candide. The young man approaches, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) raises the veil with a timid hand. Oh! what a moment! what surprise! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believes he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beholds Miss Cunegonde? he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really sees her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)! it is herself! His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strength fails him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot utter a word, but drops at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet.
<p/>Cunegonde falls upon the sofa. The old woman supplies a smelling bottle; they come to themselves and recover their speech. As they began with broken accents, with questions and answers interchangeably interrupted with sighs, with tears, and cries. The old woman desired they would make less noise and then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) left them to themselves. <div class="bookquote">``What, is it you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``you live? I find you again in Portugal? then you have not been ravished? then they did not rip open your belly as Doctor Pangloss informed me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, they did,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the beautiful Cunegonde; <div class="bookquote">``but those two accidents are not always mortal.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But were your father and mother killed?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is but too true,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Cunegonde, in tears. '' And your brother?'' <div class="bookquote">``My brother also was killed.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And why are you in Portugal? and how did you know of my being here? and by what strange adventure did you contrive to bring me to this house?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will tell you all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the lady, <div class="bookquote">``but first of all let me know your history, since the innocent kiss you gave me and the kicks which you received.''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>Candide respectfully obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and though he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was still in a surprise, though his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) voice was feeble and trembling, though his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) back still pained him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), yet he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a most ingenuous account of everything that had befallen him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) since the moment of their separation. Cunegonde lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes to heaven; shed tears upon hearing of the death of the good Anabaptist and of Pangloss; after which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke as follows to Candide, who did not lose a word and devoured her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) eyes. VIII THE HISTORY OF CUNEGONDE.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was in bed and fast asleep when it pleased God to send the Bulgarians to our delightful castle of Thunder-ten-Tronckh; they slew my father and brother, and cut my mother in pieces. A tall Bulgarian, six feet high, perceiving that I had fainted away at this sight, began to ravish me; this made me recover; I regained my senses, I cried, I struggled, I bit, I scratched, I wanted to tear out the tall Bulgarian's eyes--not knowing that what happened at my father's house was the usual practice of war. The brute gave me a cut in the left side with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hanger, and the mark is still upon me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I hope I shall see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said honest Candide. <div class="bookquote">``You shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Cunegonde, <div class="bookquote">``but let us continue.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do so,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Candide. Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) resumed the thread of her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) story: <div class="bookquote">``A Bulgarian captain came in, saw me all bleeding, and the soldier not in the least disconcerted. The captain flew into a passion at the disrespectful behaviour of the brute, and slew him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) on my body. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) ordered my wounds to be dressed, and took me to his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) quarters as a prisoner of war. I washed the few shirts that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had , I did his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) cooking; he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) thought me very pretty--he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) avowed it; on the other hand, I must own he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had a good shape, and a soft and white skin; but he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had little or no mind or philosophy, and you might see plainly that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had never been instructed by Doctor Pangloss. In three months time, having lost all his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) money, and being grown tired of my company, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) sold me to a Jew, named Don Issachar, who traded to Holland and Portugal, and had a strong passion for women.
<p/>This Jew was much attached to my person, but could not triumph over it; I resisted him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) better than the Bulgarian soldier. A modest woman may be ravished once, but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) virtue is strengthened by it. In order to render me more tractable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) brought me to this country house. Hitherto I had imagined that nothing could equal the beauty of Thunder-ten-Tronckh Castle; but I found I was mistaken. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The Grand Inquisitor, seeing me one day at Mass, stared long at me, and sent to tell me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) wished to speak on private matters. I was conducted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) palace, where I acquainted him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) with the history of my family, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) represented to me how much it was beneath my rank to belong to an Israelite. A proposal was then made to Don Issachar that he (<font color='blue'><b>Issachar</b></font>) should resign me to my lord. Don Issachar, being the court banker, and a man of credit, would hear nothing of it. The Inquisitor threatened him (<font color='blue'><b>Issachar</b></font>) with an auto-da-fé . At last my Jew, intimidated, concluded a bargain, by which the house and myself should belong to both in common; the Jew should have for himself Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, and the Inquisitor should have the rest of the week. It is now six months since this agreement was made. Quarrels have not been wanting, for they could not decide whether the night from Saturday to Sunday belonged to the old law or to the new. For my part, I have so far held out against both, and I verily believe that this is the reason why I am still beloved. '' At length, to avert the scourge of earthquakes, and to intimidate Don Issachar, my Lord Inquisitor was pleased to celebrate an auto-da-fé .
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Inquisitor</b></font>) did me the honour to invite me to the ceremony. I had a very good seat, and the ladies were served with refreshments between Mass and the execution. I was in truth seized with horror at the burning of those two Jews, and of the honest Biscayner who had married his (<font color='blue'><b>Inquisitor</b></font>) godmother; but what was my surprise, my fright, my trouble, when I saw in a san-benito and mitre a figure which resembled that of Pangloss! I rubbed my eyes, I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Inquisitor</b></font>) attentively, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Inquisitor</b></font>) hung; I fainted. Scarcely had I recovered my senses than I saw you stripped, stark naked, and this was the height of my horror, consternation, grief, and despair. I tell you, truthfully, that your skin is yet whiter and of a more perfect colour than that of my Bulgarian captain. This spectacle redoubled all the feelings which overwhelmed and devoured me. I screamed out, and would have said, `Stop, barbarians!' but my voice failed me, and my cries would have been useless after you had been severely whipped. How is it possible, said I, that the beloved Candide and the wise Pangloss should both be at Lisbon, the one to receive a hundred lashes, and the other to be hanged by the Grand Inquisitor, of whom I am the well-beloved? Pangloss most cruelly deceived me when he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said that everything in the world is for the best. ''
<p/>Agitated, lost, sometimes beside myself, and sometimes ready to die of weakness, my mind was filled with the massacre of my father, mother, and brother, with the insolence of the ugly Bulgarian soldier, with the stab that he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) gave me, with my servitude under the Bulgarian captain, with my hideous Don Issachar, with my abominable Inquisitor, with the execution of Doctor Pangloss, with the grand Miserere to which they whipped you, and especially with the kiss I gave you behind the screen the day that I had last seen you. I praised God for bringing you back to me after so many trials, and I charged my old woman to take care of you, and to conduct you hither as soon as possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has executed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) commission perfectly well; I have tasted the inexpressible pleasure of seeing you again, of hearing you, of speaking with you. But you must be hungry, for myself, I am famished; let us have supper. '' They both sat down to table, and, when supper was over, they placed themselves once more on the sofa; where they were when Signor Don Issachar arrived. It was the Jewish Sabbath, and Issachar had come to enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>Issachar</b></font>) rights, and to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Issachar</b></font>) tender love. IX WHAT BECAME OF CUNEGONDE, CANDIDE, THE GRAND INQUISITOR, AND THE JEW. This Issachar was the most choleric Hebrew that had ever been seen in Israel since the Captivity in Babylon. '' What!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>JEW</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``thou bitch of a Galilean, was not the Inquisitor enough for thee? Must this rascal also share with me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In saying this he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) drew a long poniard which he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) always carried about him (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>); and not imagining that his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) adversary had any arms he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) threw himself upon Candide: but our honest Westphalian had received a handsome sword from the old woman along with the suit of clothes. He (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) rapier, despite his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) gentleness, and laid the Israelite stone dead upon the cushions at Cunegonde's feet. '' Holy Virgin! '' cried she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``what will become of us? A man killed in my apartment! If the officers of justice come, we are lost!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Had not Pangloss been hanged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would give us good counsel in this emergency, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a profound philosopher. Failing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let us consult the old woman. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was very prudent and commenced to give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) opinion when suddenly another little door opened. It was an hour after midnight, it was the beginning of Sunday. This day belonged to my lord the Inquisitor. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) entered, and saw the whipped Candide, sword in hand, a dead man upon the floor, Cunegonde aghast, and the old woman giving counsel. At this moment, the following is what passed in the soul of Candide, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) reasoned: If this holy man call in assistance, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will surely have me burnt; and Cunegonde will perhaps be served in the same manner; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the cause of my being cruelly whipped; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is my rival; and, as I have now begun to kill, I will kill away, for there is no time to hesitate. This reasoning was clear and instantaneous; so that without giving time to the Inquisitor to recover from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pierced him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) through and through, and cast him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beside the Jew. '' Yet again!''
<p/>said Cunegonde, <div class="bookquote">``now there is no mercy for us, we are excommunicated, our last hour has come. How could you do it? you, naturally so gentle, to slay a Jew and a prelate in two minutes!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My beautiful young lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>responded Candide, <div class="bookquote">``when one is a lover, jealous and whipped by the Inquisition, one stops at nothing. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div>The old woman then put in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) word, saying: <div class="bookquote">``There are three Andalusian horses in the stable with bridles and saddles, let the brave Candide get them ready; madame has money, jewels; let us therefore mount quickly on horseback, though I can sit only on one buttock; let us set out for Cadiz, it is the finest weather in the world, and there is great pleasure in travelling in the cool of the night.''  (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div>Immediately Candide saddled the three horses, and Cunegonde, the old woman and he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), travelled thirty miles at a stretch. While they were journeying, the Holy Brotherhood entered the house; my lord the Inquisitor was interred in a handsome church, and Issachar's body was thrown upon a dunghill. Candide, Cunegonde, and the old woman, had now reached the little town of Avacena in the midst of the mountains of the Sierra Morena, and were speaking as follows in a public inn. X IN WHAT DISTRESS CANDIDE, CUNEGONDE, AND THE OLD WOMAN ARRIVED AT CADIZ; AND OF THEIR EMBARKATION. '' Who was it that robbed me of my money and jewels? '' said Cunegonde, all bathed in tears. <div class="bookquote">``How shall we live? What shall we do? Where find Inquisitors or Jews who will give me more?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Alas!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman, <div class="bookquote">``I have a shrewd suspicion of a reverend Grey Friar, who stayed last night in the same inn with us at Badajos.
<p/>God preserve me from judging rashly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) came into our room twice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) set out upon his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) journey long before us.''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Alas!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``dear Pangloss has often demonstrated to me that the goods of this world are common to all men, and that each has an equal right to them. But according to these principles the Grey Friar ought to have left us enough to carry us through our journey. Have you nothing at all left, my dear Cunegonde?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not a farthing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What then must we do?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide. '' Sell one of the horses,'' replied the old woman. <div class="bookquote">``I will ride behind Miss Cunegonde, though I can hold myself only on one buttock, and we shall reach Cadiz.''  (<font color='red'><b>a Benedictine</b></font>)</div>In the same inn there was a Benedictine prior who bought the horse for a cheap price. Candide, Cunegonde, and the old woman, having passed through Lucena, Chillas, and Lebrixa, arrived at length at Cadiz. A fleet was there getting ready, and troops assembling to bring to reason the reverend Jesuit Fathers of Paraguay, accused of having made one of the native tribes in the neighborhood of San Sacrament revolt against the Kings of Spain and Portugal. Candide having been in the Bulgarian service, performed the military exercise before the general of this little army with so graceful an address, with so intrepid an air, and with such agility and expedition, that he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) was given the command of a company of foot. Now, he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) was a captain! He (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) set sail with Miss Cunegonde, the old woman, two valets, and the two Andalusian horses, which had belonged to the grand Inquisitor of Portugal. During their voyage they reasoned a good deal on the philosophy of poor Pangloss.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are going into another world,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide; <div class="bookquote">``and surely it must be there that all is for the best. For I must confess there is reason to complain a little of what passeth in our world in regard to both natural and moral philosophy.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I love you with all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Cunegonde; <div class="bookquote">``but my soul is still full of fright at that which I have seen and experienced.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All will be well,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Candide; <div class="bookquote">``the sea of this new world is already better than our European sea; it is calmer, the winds more regular. It is certainly the New World which is the best of all possible worlds.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``God grant it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Cunegonde; <div class="bookquote">``but I have been so horribly unhappy there that my heart is almost closed to hope.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You complain,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman; <div class="bookquote">``alas! you have not known such misfortunes as mine. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>Cunegonde almost broke out laughing, finding the good woman very amusing, for pretending to have been as unfortunate as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Alas!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Cunegonde, <div class="bookquote">``my good mother, unless you have been ravished by two Bulgarians, have received two deep wounds in your belly, have had two castles demolished, have had two mothers cut to pieces before your eyes, and two of your lovers whipped at an auto-da-fé , I do not conceive how you could be more unfortunate than I. Add that I was born a baroness of seventy-two quarterings--and have been a cook!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replied the old woman, <div class="bookquote">``you do not know my birth; and were I to show you my backside, you would not talk in that manner, but would suspend your judgment. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>This speech having raised extreme curiosity in the minds of Cunegonde and Candide, the old woman spoke to them as follows. XI HISTORY OF THE OLD WOMAN.
<p/>``I had not always bleared eyes and red eyelids; neither did my nose always touch my chin; nor was I always a servant. I am the daughter of Pope Urban X,-LSB-10-RSB- and of the Princess of Palestrina. Until the age of fourteen I was brought up in a palace, to which all the castles of your German barons would scarcely have served for stables; and one of my robes was worth more than all the magnificence of Westphalia. As I grew up I improved in beauty, wit, and every graceful accomplishment, in the midst of pleasures, hopes, and respectful homage. Already I inspired love. My throat was formed, and such a throat! white, firm, and shaped like that of the Venus of Medici; and what eyes! what eyelids! what black eyebrows! such flames darted from my dark pupils that they eclipsed the scintillation of the stars--as I was told by the poets in our part of the world. My waiting women, when dressing and undressing me, used to fall into an ecstasy, whether they viewed me before or behind; how glad would the gentlemen have been to perform that office for them! <div class="bookquote">``I was affianced to the most excellent Prince of Massa Carara. Such a prince! as handsome as myself, sweet-tempered, agreeable, brilliantly witty, and sparkling with love. I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Carara</b></font>) as one loves for the first time--with idolatry, with transport. The nuptials were prepared. There was surprising pomp and magnificence; there were fêtes , carousals, continual opera bouffe ; and all Italy composed sonnets in my praise, though not one of them was passable. I was just upon the point of reaching the summit of bliss, when an old marchioness who had been mistress to the Prince, my husband, invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) to drink chocolate with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) died in less than two hours of most terrible convulsions. But this is only a bagatelle. My mother, in despair, and scarcely less afflicted than myself, determined to absent herself for some time from so fatal a place. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had a very fine estate in the neighbourhood of Gaeta. We embarked on board a galley of the country which was gilded like the great altar of St. Peter's at Rome. A Sallee corsair swooped down and boarded us. Our men defended themselves like the Pope's soldiers; they flung themselves upon their knees, and threw down their arms, begging of the corsair an absolution in articulo mortis . ''  (<font color='red'><b>monkeys</b></font>)</div>Instantly they were stripped as bare as monkeys; my mother, our maids of honour, and myself were all served in the same manner. It is amazing with what expedition those gentry undress people. But what surprised me most was, that they thrust their fingers into the part of our bodies which the generality of women suffer no other instrument but--pipes to enter. It appeared to me a very strange kind of ceremony; but thus one judges of things when one has not seen the world. I afterwards learnt that it was to try whether we had concealed any diamonds. This is the practice established from time immemorial, among civilised nations that scour the seas. I was informed that the very religious Knights of Malta never fail to make this search when they take any Turkish prisoners of either sex. It is a law of nations from which they never deviate. <div class="bookquote">``I need not tell you how great a hardship it was for a young princess and her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) mother to be made slaves and carried to Morocco. You may easily imagine all we had to suffer on board the pirate vessel.
<p/>My mother was still very handsome; our maids of honour, and even our waiting women, had more charms than are to be found in all Africa. As for myself, I was ravishing, was exquisite, grace itself, and I was a virgin! I did not remain so long; this flower, which had been reserved for the handsome Prince of Massa Carara, was plucked by the corsair captain. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was an abominable negro, and yet believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) did me a great deal of honour. Certainly the Princess of Palestrina and myself must have been very strong to go through all that we experienced until our arrival at Morocco. But let us pass on; these are such common things as not to be worth mentioning. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Morocco swam in blood when we arrived. Fifty sons of the Emperor Muley-Ismael-LSB-11-RSB- had each their adherents; this produced fifty civil wars, of blacks against blacks, and blacks against tawnies, and tawnies against tawnies, and mulattoes against mulattoes. In short it was a continual carnage throughout the empire. <div class="bookquote">``No sooner were we landed, than the blacks of a contrary faction to that of my captain attempted to rob him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) booty. Next to jewels and gold we were the most valuable things he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had. I was witness to such a battle as you have never seen in your European climates. The northern nations have not that heat in their blood, nor that raging lust for women, so common in Africa. It seems that you Europeans have only milk in your veins; but it is vitriol, it is fire which runs in those of the inhabitants of Mount Atlas and the neighbouring countries. They fought with the fury of the lions, tigers, and serpents of the country, to see who should have us.
<p/>A Moor seized my mother by the right arm, while my captain's lieutenant held her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) by the left; a Moorish soldier had hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) by one leg, and one of our corsairs held her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) by the other. Thus almost all our women were drawn in quarters by four men. My captain concealed me behind him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>); and with his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) drawn scimitar cut and slashed every one that opposed his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) fury. At length I saw all our Italian women, and my mother herself, torn, mangled, massacred, by the monsters who disputed over them. The slaves, my companions, those who had taken them, soldiers, sailors, blacks, whites, mulattoes, and at last my captain, all were killed, and I remained dying on a heap of dead. Such scenes as this were transacted through an extent of three hundred leagues--and yet they never missed the five prayers a day ordained by Mahomet. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>With difficulty I disengaged myself from such a heap of slaughtered bodies, and crawled to a large orange tree on the bank of a neighbouring rivulet, where I fell, oppressed with fright, fatigue, horror, despair, and hunger. Immediately after, my senses, overpowered, gave themselves up to sleep, which was yet more swooning than repose. I was in this state of weakness and insensibility, between life and death, when I felt myself pressed by something that moved upon my body. I opened my eyes, and saw a white man, of good countenance, who sighed, and who said between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth: ' O che sciagura d'essere senza coglioni! '''-LSB-12-RSB- XII THE ADVENTURES OF THE OLD WOMAN CONTINUED. '' Astonished and delighted to hear my native language, and no less surprised at what this man said, I made answer that there were much greater misfortunes than that of which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) complained.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in a few words of the horrors which I had endured, and fainted a second time. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carried me to a neighbouring house, put me to bed, gave me food, waited upon me, consoled me, flattered me; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never seen any one so beautiful as I, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never so much regretted the loss of what it was impossible to recover. '' 'I was born at Naples ,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), `there they geld two or three thousand children every year; some die of the operation, others acquire a voice more beautiful than that of women, and others are raised to offices of state.-LSB-13-RSB- This operation was performed on me with great success and I was chapel musician to madam, the Princess of Palestrina.' '' `To my mother!' cried I. ''`Your mother!' cried he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>), weeping. ' What! can you be that young princess whom I brought up until the age of six years, and who promised so early to be as beautiful as you?' '' `It is I, indeed; but my mother lies four hundred yards hence, torn in quarters, under a heap of dead bodies.' <div class="bookquote">``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) all my adventures, and he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) made me acquainted with his (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>); telling me that he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) had been sent to the Emperor of Morocco by a Christian power, to conclude a treaty with that prince, in consequence of which he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) was to be furnished with military stores and ships to help to demolish the commerce of other Christian Governments. ''  (<font color='red'><b>this eunuch</b></font>)</div>`My mission is done,' said this honest eunuch; 'I go to embark for Ceuta, and will take you to Italy. Ma che sciagura d'essere senza coglioni! '
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) with tears of commiseration; and instead of taking me to Italy he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) conducted me to Algiers, where he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) sold me to the Dey. Scarcely was I sold, than the plague which had made the tour of Africa, Asia, and Europe, broke out with great malignancy in Algiers. You have seen earthquakes; but pray, miss, have you ever had the plague?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Cunegonde. <div class="bookquote">``If you had,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman, <div class="bookquote">``you would acknowledge that it is far more terrible than an earthquake. It is common in Africa, and I caught it. Imagine to yourself the distressed situation of the daughter of a Pope, only fifteen years old, who, in less than three months, had felt the miseries of poverty and slavery, had been ravished almost every day, had beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother drawn in quarters, had experienced famine and war, and was dying of the plague in Algiers. I did not die, however, but my eunuch, and the Dey, and almost the whole seraglio of Algiers perished. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>As soon as the first fury of this terrible pestilence was over, a sale was made of the Dey's slaves; I was purchased by a merchant, and carried to Tunis; this man sold me to another merchant, who sold me again to another at Tripoli; from Tripoli I was sold to Alexandria, from Alexandria to Smyrna, and from Smyrna to Constantinople. At length I became the property of an Aga of the Janissaries, who was soon ordered away to the defence of Azof, then besieged by the Russians. '' The Aga, who was a very gallant man, took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole seraglio with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and lodged us in a small fort on the Palus Méotides, guarded by two black eunuchs and twenty soldiers.
<p/>The Turks killed prodigious numbers of the Russians, but the latter had their revenge. Azof was destroyed by fire, the inhabitants put to the sword, neither sex nor age was spared; until there remained only our little fort, and the enemy wanted to starve us out. The twenty Janissaries had sworn they would never surrender. The extremities of famine to which they were reduced, obliged them to eat our two eunuchs, for fear of violating their oath. And at the end of a few days they resolved also to devour the women. <div class="bookquote">``We had a very pious and humane Iman, who preached an excellent sermon, exhorting them not to kill us all at once. '' (<font color='red'><b>those ladies</b></font>)</div>`Only cut off a buttock of each of those ladies,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), `and you'll fare extremely well; if you must go to it again, there will be the same entertainment a few days hence; heaven will accept of so charitable an action, and send you relief.' ``He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had great eloquence; he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) persuaded them; we underwent this terrible operation. The Iman applied the same balsam to us, as he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) does to children after circumcision; and we all nearly died. <div class="bookquote">``Scarcely had the Janissaries finished the repast with which we had furnished them, than the Russians came in flat-bottomed boats; not a Janissary escaped. The Russians paid no attention to the condition we were in. There are French surgeons in all parts of the world; one of them who was very clever took us under his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) care--he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) cured us; and as long as I live I shall remember that as soon as my wounds were healed he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) made proposals to me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) bid us all be of good cheer, telling us that the like had happened in many sieges, and that it was according to the laws of war. ''  (<font color='red'><b>companions</b></font>)</div>As soon as my companions could walk, they were obliged to set out for Moscow. I fell to the share of a Boyard who made me his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) gardener, and gave me twenty lashes a day. But this nobleman having in two years' time been broke upon the wheel along with thirty more Boyards for some broils at court, I profited by that event; I fled. I traversed all Russia; I was a long time an inn-holder's servant at Riga, the same at Rostock, at Vismar, at Leipzig, at Cassel, at Utrecht, at Leyden, at the Hague, at Rotterdam. I waxed old in misery and disgrace, having only one-half of my posteriors, and always remembering I was a Pope's daughter. A hundred times I was upon the point of killing myself; but still I loved life. This ridiculous foible is perhaps one of our most fatal characteristics; for is there anything more absurd than to wish to carry continually a burden which one can always throw down? to detest existence and yet to cling to one's existence? in brief, to caress the serpent which devours us, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) has eaten our very heart? <div class="bookquote">``In the different countries which it has been my lot to traverse, and the numerous inns where I have been servant, I have taken notice of a vast number of people who held their own existence in abhorrence, and yet I never knew of more than eight who voluntarily put an end to their misery; three negroes, four Englishmen, and a German professor named Robek.-LSB-14-RSB-
<p/>I ended by being servant to the Jew, Don Issachar, who placed me near your presence, my fair lady. I am determined to share your fate, and have been much more affected with your misfortunes than with my own. I would never even have spoken to you of my misfortunes, had you not piqued me a little, and if it were not customary to tell stories on board a ship in order to pass away the time. In short, Miss Cunegonde, I have had experience, I know the world; therefore I advise you to divert yourself, and prevail upon each passenger to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) story; and if there be one of them all, that has not cursed his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) life many a time, that has not frequently looked upon himself as the unhappiest of mortals , I give you leave to throw me headforemost into the sea.''  (<font color='red'><b>THE WOMAN</b></font>)</div>XIII HOW CANDIDE WAS FORCED AWAY FROM HIS (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) FAIR CUNEGONDE AND THE OLD WOMAN. The beautiful Cunegonde having heard the old woman's history, paid her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) all the civilities due to a person of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rank and merit. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) likewise accepted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) proposal, and engaged all the passengers, one after the other, to relate their adventures; and then both she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and Candide allowed that the old woman was in the right. <div class="bookquote">``It is a great pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``that the sage Pangloss was hanged contrary to custom at an auto-da-fé ; he (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) would tell us most amazing things in regard to the physical and moral evils that overspread earth and sea, and I should be able, with due respect, to make a few objections.''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div>While each passenger was recounting his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) story, the ship made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way. They landed at Buenos Ayres.
<p/>Cunegonde, Captain Candide, and the old woman, waited on the Governor, Don Fernando d'Ibaraa, y Figueora, y Mascarenes, y Lampourdos, y Souza. This nobleman had a stateliness becoming a person who bore so many names. He (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) spoke to men with so noble a disdain, carried his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) nose so loftily, raised his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) voice so unmercifully, assumed so imperious an air, and stalked with such intolerable pride, that those who saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) were strongly inclined to give him (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) a good drubbing. Cunegonde appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) the most beautiful he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) had ever met. The first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) did was to ask whether she (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) was not the captain's wife. The manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) asked the question alarmed Candide; he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) durst not say she (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) wife, because indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) was not; neither durst he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) say she (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) sister, because it was not so; and although this obliging lie had been formerly much in favour among the ancients, and although it could be useful to the moderns, his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) soul was too pure to betray the truth. '' Miss Cunegonde,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``is to do me the honour to marry me, and we beseech your excellency to deign to sanction our marriage.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Don Fernando d'Ibaraa, y Figueora, y Mascarenes, y Lampourdos, y Souza, turning up his (<font color='blue'><b>Souza</b></font>) moustachios, smiled mockingly, and ordered Captain Candide to go and review his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) company. Candide obeyed, and the Governor remained alone with Miss Cunegonde. He (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) passion, protesting he (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) would marry her (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) the next day in the face of the church, or otherwise, just as should be agreeable to herself. Cunegonde asked a quarter of an hour to consider of it, to consult the old woman, and to take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) resolution.
<p/>The old woman spoke thus to Cunegonde: <div class="bookquote">``Miss, you have seventy-two quarterings, and not a farthing; it is now in your power to be wife to the greatest lord in South America, who has very beautiful moustachios. Is it for you to pique yourself upon inviolable fidelity? You have been ravished by Bulgarians; a Jew and an Inquisitor have enjoyed your favours. Misfortune gives sufficient excuse. I own, that if I were in your place, I should have no scruple in marrying the Governor and in making the fortune of Captain Candide.''  (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div>While the old woman spoke with all the prudence which age and experience gave, a small ship entered the port on board of which were an Alcalde and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) alguazils, and this was what had happened. As the old woman had shrewdly guessed, it was a Grey Friar who stole Cunegonde's money and jewels in the town of Badajos, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and Candide were escaping. The Friar wanted to sell some of the diamonds to a jeweller; the jeweller knew them to be the Grand Inquisitor's. The Friar before he (<font color='blue'><b>Friar</b></font>) was hanged confessed he (<font color='blue'><b>Friar</b></font>) had stolen them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Friar</b></font>) described the persons, and the route they had taken. The flight of Cunegonde and Candide was already known. They were traced to Cadiz. A vessel was immediately sent in pursuit of them. The vessel was already in the port of Buenos Ayres. The report spread that the Alcalde was going to land, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) was in pursuit of the murderers of my lord the Grand Inquisitor. The prudent old woman saw at once what was to be done.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot run away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to Cunegonde, <div class="bookquote">``and you have nothing to fear, for it was not you that killed my lord; besides the Governor who loves you will not suffer you to be ill-treated; therefore stay. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) then ran immediately to Candide. '' Fly,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``or in an hour you will be burnt. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>There was not a moment to lose; but how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) part from Cunegonde, and where could he (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) flee for shelter? XIV HOW CANDIDE AND CACAMBO WERE RECEIVED BY THE JESUITS OF PARAGUAY. Candide had brought such a valet with him (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) from Cadiz, as one often meets with on the coasts of Spain and in the American colonies. He (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) was a quarter Spaniard, born of a mongrel in Tucuman; he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) had been singing-boy, sacristan, sailor, monk, pedlar, soldier, and lackey. His (<font color='blue'><b>lackey</b></font>) name was Cacambo, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lackey</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>lackey</b></font>) master, because his (<font color='blue'><b>lackey</b></font>) master was a very good man. He (<font color='blue'><b>lackey</b></font>) quickly saddled the two Andalusian horses. '' Come, master, let us follow the old woman's advice; let us start, and run without looking behind us.'' Candide shed tears. '' Oh! my dear Cunegonde! must I leave you just at a time when the Governor was going to sanction our nuptials? Cunegonde, brought to such a distance what will become of you?'' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will do as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>said Cacambo; <div class="bookquote">``the women are never at a loss , God provides for them, let us run.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whither art thou carrying me? Where shall we go? What shall we do without Cunegonde?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide. '' By St. James of Compostella,'' said Cacambo, <div class="bookquote">``you were going to fight against the Jesuits; let us go to fight for them;
<p/>I know the road well, I'll conduct you to their kingdom, where they will be charmed to have a captain that understands the Bulgarian exercise. You'll make a prodigious fortune; if we cannot find our account in one world we shall in another. It is a great pleasure to see and do new things.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You have before been in Paraguay, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide. '' Ay, sure,'' answered Cacambo, <div class="bookquote">``I was servant in the College of the Assumption, and am acquainted with the government of the good Fathers as well as I am with the streets of Cadiz. It is an admirable government. The kingdom is upwards of three hundred leagues in diameter, and divided into thirty provinces; there the Fathers possess all, and the people nothing; it is a masterpiece of reason and justice. For my part I see nothing so divine as the Fathers who here make war upon the kings of Spain and Portugal, and in Europe confess those kings; who here kill Spaniards, and in Madrid send them to heaven; this delights me, let us push forward. You are going to be the happiest of mortals. What pleasure will it be to those Fathers to hear that a captain who knows the Bulgarian exercise has come to them!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>As soon as they reached the first barrier, Cacambo told the advanced guard that a captain wanted to speak with my lord the Commandant. Notice was given to the main guard, and immediately a Paraguayan officer ran and laid himself at the feet of the Commandant, to impart this news to him (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>). Candide and Cacambo were disarmed, and their two Andalusian horses seized.
<p/>The strangers were introduced between two files of musketeers; the Commandant was at the further end, with the three-cornered cap on his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) head, his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) gown tucked up, a sword by his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) side, and a spontoon-LSB-15-RSB- in his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) beckoned, and straightway the new-comers were encompassed by four-and-twenty soldiers. A sergeant told them they must wait, that the Commandant could not speak to them, and that the reverend Father Provincial does not suffer any Spaniard to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Spaniard</b></font>) mouth but in his (<font color='blue'><b>Spaniard</b></font>) presence, or to stay above three hours in the province. '' And where is the reverend Father Provincial?'' said Cacambo. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) is upon the parade just after celebrating mass,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>answered the sergeant, <div class="bookquote">``and you cannot kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) spurs till three hours hence.''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``However,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>said Cacambo, <div class="bookquote">``the captain is not a Spaniard, but a German, he (<font color='blue'><b>Spaniard</b></font>) is ready to perish with hunger as well as myself; cannot we have something for breakfast, while we wait for his (<font color='blue'><b>Spaniard</b></font>) reverence? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>The sergeant went immediately to acquaint the Commandant with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) had heard. <div class="bookquote">``God be praised!''  (<font color='red'><b>reverend</b></font>)</div>said the reverend Commandant, <div class="bookquote">``since he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) is a German, I may speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>); take him (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) to my arbour. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the reverend Commandant</b></font>)</div>Candide was at once conducted to a beautiful summer-house, ornamented with a very pretty colonnade of green and gold marble, and with trellises, enclosing parraquets, humming-birds, fly-birds, guinea-hens, and all other rare birds. An excellent breakfast was provided in vessels of gold; and while the Paraguayans were eating maize out of wooden dishes, in the open fields and exposed to the heat of the sun, the reverend Father Commandant retired to his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) arbour.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) was a very handsome young man, with a full face, white skin but high in colour; he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) had an arched eyebrow, a lively eye, red ears, vermilion lips, a bold air, but such a boldness as neither belonged to a Spaniard nor a Jesuit. They returned their arms to Candide and Cacambo, and also the two Andalusian horses; to whom Cacambo gave some oats to eat just by the arbour, having an eye upon them all the while for fear of a surprise. Candide first kissed the hem of the Commandant's robe, then they sat down to table. <div class="bookquote">``You are, then, a German?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Jesuit</b></font>)</div>said the Jesuit to him (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) in that language. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, reverend Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Candide. As they pronounced these words they looked at each other with great amazement, and with such an emotion as they could not conceal. '' And from what part of Germany do you come?'' said the Jesuit. <div class="bookquote">``I am from the dirty province of Westphalia,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Candide; <div class="bookquote">``I was born in the Castle of Thunder-ten-Tronckh.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Heavens! is it possible? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Commandant</b></font>)</div>cried the Commandant. <div class="bookquote">``What a miracle!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Candide. <div class="bookquote">``Is it really you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Commandant</b></font>)</div>said the Commandant. <div class="bookquote">``It is not possible!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide. They drew back; they embraced; they shed rivulets of tears. '' What, is it you, reverend Father? You, the brother of the fair Cunegonde! You, that was slain by the Bulgarians! You, the Baron's son! You, a Jesuit in Paraguay! I must confess this is a strange world that we live in. Oh, Pangloss! Pangloss! how glad you would be if you had not been hanged!'' The Commandant sent away the negro slaves and the Paraguayans, who served them with liquors in goblets of rock-crystal.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) thanked God and St. Ignatius a thousand times; he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) clasped Candide in his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) arms; and their faces were all bathed with tears. <div class="bookquote">``You will be more surprised, more affected, and transported,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``when I tell you that Cunegonde, your sister, whom you believe to have been ripped open, is in perfect health.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``In your neighbourhood, with the Governor of Buenos Ayres; and I was going to fight against you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Every word which they uttered in this long conversation but added wonder to wonder. Their souls fluttered on their tongues, listened in their ears, and sparkled in their eyes. As they were Germans, they sat a good while at table, waiting for the reverend Father Provincial, and the Commandant spoke to his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) dear Candide as follows. XV HOW CANDIDE KILLED THE BROTHER OF HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) DEAR CUNEGONDE. <div class="bookquote">``I shall have ever present to my memory the dreadful day, on which I saw my father and mother killed, and my sister ravished. When the Bulgarians retired, my dear sister could not be found; but my mother, my father, and myself, with two maid-servants and three little boys all of whom had been slain, were put in a hearse, to be conveyed for interment to a chapel belonging to the Jesuits, within two leagues of our family seat. A Jesuit sprinkled us with some holy water; it was horribly salt; a few drops of it fell into my eyes; the father perceived that my eyelids stirred a little; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand upon my heart and felt it beat. I received assistance, and at the end of three weeks I recovered.
<p/>You know, my dear Candide, I was very pretty; but I grew much prettier, and the reverend Father Didrie,-LSB-16-RSB- Superior of that House, conceived the tenderest friendship for me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) gave me the habit of the order, some years after I was sent to Rome. The Father-General needed new levies of young German-Jesuits. The sovereigns of Paraguay admit as few Spanish Jesuits as possible; they prefer those of other nations as being more subordinate to their commands. I was judged fit by the reverend Father-General to go and work in this vineyard. We set out--a Pole, a Tyrolese, and myself. Upon my arrival I was honoured with a sub-deaconship and a lieutenancy. I am to-day colonel and priest. We shall give a warm reception to the King of Spain's troops; I will answer for it that they shall be excommunicated and well beaten. Providence sends you here to assist us. But is it, indeed, true that my dear sister Cunegonde is in the neighbourhood, with the Governor of Buenos Ayres?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Candide assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) on oath that nothing was more true, and their tears began afresh. The Baron could not refrain from embracing Candide; he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) brother, his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) saviour. '' Ah! perhaps,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we shall together, my dear Candide, enter the town as conquerors, and recover my sister Cunegonde.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is all I want,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``for I intended to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and I still hope to do so.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You insolent! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baron</b></font>)</div>replied the Baron, <div class="bookquote">``would you have the impudence to marry my sister who has seventy-two quarterings! I find thou hast the most consummate effrontery to dare to mention so presumptuous a design!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Baron</b></font>)</div><p/>Candide, petrified at this speech, made answer: <div class="bookquote">``Reverend Father, all the quarterings in the world signify nothing; I rescued your sister from the arms of a Jew and of an Inquisitor; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has great obligations to me, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wishes to marry me; Master Pangloss always told me that all men are equal, and certainly I will marry her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We shall see that, thou scoundrel! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jesuit</b></font>)</div>said the Jesuit Baron de Thunder-ten-Tronckh, and that instant struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) across the face with the flat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) sword. Candide in an instant drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) rapier, and plunged it up to the hilt in the Jesuit's belly; but in pulling it out reeking hot, he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) burst into tears. '' Good God!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I have killed my old master, my friend, my brother-in-law! I am the best-natured creature in the world, and yet I have already killed three men, and of these three two were priests. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Cacambo, who stood sentry by the door of the arbour, ran to him (<font color='blue'><b>sentry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We have nothing more for it than to sell our lives as dearly as we can,''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>sentry</b></font>) master to him (<font color='blue'><b>sentry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``without doubt some one will soon enter the arbour, and we must die sword in hand. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Cacambo, who had been in a great many scrapes in his (<font color='blue'><b>sentry</b></font>) lifetime, did not lose his (<font color='blue'><b>sentry</b></font>) head; he (<font color='blue'><b>sentry</b></font>) took the Baron's Jesuit habit, put it on Candide, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) the square cap, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) mount on horseback. All this was done in the twinkling of an eye. '' Let us gallop fast, master, everybody will take you for a Jesuit, going to give directions to your men, and we shall have passed the frontiers before they will be able to overtake us.''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) flew as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) spoke these words, crying out aloud in Spanish: <div class="bookquote">``Make way, make way, for the reverend Father Colonel.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>XVI ADVENTURES OF THE TWO TRAVELLERS, WITH TWO GIRLS, TWO MONKEYS, AND THE SAVAGES CALLED OREILLONS. Candide and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) valet had got beyond the barrier, before it was known in the camp that the German Jesuit was dead. The wary Cacambo had taken care to fill his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wallet with bread, chocolate, bacon, fruit, and a few bottles of wine. With their Andalusian horses they penetrated into an unknown country, where they perceived no beaten track. At length they came to a beautiful meadow intersected with purling rills. Here our two adventurers fed their horses. Cacambo proposed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) master to take some food, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) set him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) an example. <div class="bookquote">``How can you ask me to eat ham,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``after killing the Baron's son, and being doomed never more to see the beautiful Cunegonde? What will it avail me to spin out my wretched days and drag them far from her (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) in remorse and despair? And what will the Journal of Trevoux -LSB-17-RSB- say?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) was thus lamenting his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) fate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) went on eating. The sun went down. The two wanderers heard some little cries which seemed to be uttered by women. They did not know whether they were cries of pain or joy; but they started up precipitately with that inquietude and alarm which every little thing inspires in an unknown country. The noise was made by two naked girls, who tripped along the mead, while two monkeys were pursuing them and biting their buttocks.
<p/>Candide was moved with pity; he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) had learned to fire a gun in the Bulgarian service, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) was so clever at it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) could hit a filbert in a hedge without touching a leaf of the tree. He (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) double-barrelled Spanish fusil, let it off, and killed the two monkeys. <div class="bookquote">``God be praised! My dear Cacambo, I have rescued those two poor creatures from a most perilous situation. If I have committed a sin in killing an Inquisitor and a Jesuit, I have made ample amends by saving the lives of these girls. Perhaps they are young ladies of family; and this adventure may procure us great advantages in this country. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was continuing, but stopped short when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) saw the two girls tenderly embracing the monkeys, bathing their bodies in tears, and rending the air with the most dismal lamentations. <div class="bookquote">``Little did I expect to see such good-nature,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) at length to Cacambo; who made answer: <div class="bookquote">``Master, you have done a fine thing now; you have slain the sweethearts of those two young ladies.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The sweethearts! Is it possible? You are jesting, Cacambo, I can never believe it!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dear master,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>replied Cacambo; <div class="bookquote">``you are surprised at everything. Why should you think it so strange that in some countries there are monkeys which insinuate themselves into the good graces of the ladies; they are a fourth part human, as I am a fourth part Spaniard.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Alas!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Candide, <div class="bookquote">``I remember to have heard Master Pangloss say, that formerly such accidents used to happen; that these mixtures were productive of Centaurs, Fauns, and Satyrs; and that many of the ancients had seen such monsters, but I looked upon the whole as fabulous.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought now to be convinced,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>said Cacambo, <div class="bookquote">``that it is the truth, and you see what use is made of those creatures, by persons that have not had a proper education; all I fear is that those ladies will play us some ugly trick. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>These sound reflections induced Candide to leave the meadow and to plunge into a wood. He (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>) supped there with Cacambo; and after cursing the Portuguese inquisitor, the Governor of Buenos Ayres, and the Baron, they fell asleep on moss. On awaking they felt that they could not move; for during the night the Oreillons, who inhabited that country, and to whom the ladies had denounced them, had bound them with cords made of the bark of trees. They were encompassed by fifty naked Oreillons, armed with bows and arrows, with clubs and flint hatchets. Some were making a large cauldron boil, others were preparing spits, and all cried: <div class="bookquote">``A Jesuit! a Jesuit! we shall be revenged, we shall have excellent cheer, let us eat the Jesuit, let us eat him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesuit</b></font>) up!''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I told you, my dear master,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>cried Cacambo sadly, <div class="bookquote">``that those two girls would play us some ugly trick.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>Candide seeing the cauldron and the spits, cried: <div class="bookquote">``We are certainly going to be either roasted or boiled. Ah! what would Master Pangloss say, were he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) to see how pure nature is formed? Everything is right, may be, but I declare it is very hard to have lost Miss Cunegonde and to be put upon a spit by Oreillons. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>Cacambo never lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) head. '' Do not despair,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) to the disconsolate Candide, <div class="bookquote">``I understand a little of the jargon of these people, I will speak to them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``to represent to them how frightfully inhuman it is to cook men, and how very un-Christian.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>said Cacambo, <div class="bookquote">``you reckon you are to-day going to feast upon a Jesuit. It is all very well, nothing is more unjust than thus to treat your enemies. Indeed, the law of nature teaches us to kill our neighbour, and such is the practice all over the world. If we do not accustom ourselves to eating them, it is because we have better fare. But you have not the same resources as we; certainly it is much better to devour your enemies than to resign to the crows and rooks the fruits of your victory. But, gentlemen, surely you would not choose to eat your friends. You believe that you are going to spit a Jesuit, and he (<font color='blue'><b>enemies</b></font>) is your defender. It is the enemy of your enemies that you are going to roast. As for myself, I was born in your country; this gentleman is my master, and, far from being a Jesuit, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) has just killed one, whose spoils he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wears; and thence comes your mistake. To convince you of the truth of what I say, take his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) habit and carry it to the first barrier of the Jesuit kingdom, and inform yourselves whether my master did not kill a Jesuit officer. It will not take you long, and you can always eat us if you find that I have lied to you. But I have told you the truth. You are too well acquainted with the principles of public law, humanity, and justice not to pardon us.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>The Oreillons found this speech very reasonable.
<p/>They deputed two of their principal people with all expedition to inquire into the truth of the matter; these executed their commission like men of sense, and soon returned with good news. The Oreillons untied their prisoners, showed them all sorts of civilities, offered them girls, gave them refreshment, and reconducted them to the confines of their territories, proclaiming with great joy: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) is no Jesuit! He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) is no Jesuit!''  (<font color='red'><b>girls</b></font>)</div>Candide could not help being surprised at the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) deliverance. '' What people!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``what men! what manners! If I had not been so lucky as to run Miss Cunegonde's brother through the body, I should have been devoured without redemption. But, after all, pure nature is good, since these people, instead of feasting upon my flesh, have shown me a thousand civilities, when then I was not a Jesuit.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>XVII ARRIVAL OF CANDIDE AND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) VALET AT EL DORADO, AND WHAT THEY SAW THERE. <div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>said Cacambo to Candide, as soon as they had reached the frontiers of the Oreillons, <div class="bookquote">``that this hemisphere is not better than the others, take my word for it; let us go back to Europe by the shortest way.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How go back? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``and where shall we go? to my own country? The Bulgarians and the Abares are slaying all; to Portugal? there I shall be burnt; and if we abide here we are every moment in danger of being spitted. But how can I resolve to quit a part of the world where my dear Cunegonde resides?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let us turn towards Cayenne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>said Cacambo, <div class="bookquote">``there we shall find Frenchmen, who wander all over the world; they may assist us; God will perhaps have pity on us.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>It was not easy to get to Cayenne; they knew vaguely in which direction to go, but rivers, precipices, robbers, savages, obstructed them all the way. Their horses died of fatigue. Their provisions were consumed; they fed a whole month upon wild fruits, and found themselves at last near a little river bordered with cocoa trees, which sustained their lives and their hopes. Cacambo, who was as good a counsellor as the old woman, said to Candide: <div class="bookquote">``We are able to hold out no longer; we have walked enough. I see an empty canoe near the river-side; let us fill it with cocoanuts, throw ourselves into it, and go with the current; a river always leads to some inhabited spot. If we do not find pleasant things we shall at least find new things.''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``let us recommend ourselves to Providence. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div>They rowed a few leagues, between banks, in some places flowery, in others barren; in some parts smooth, in others rugged. The stream ever widened, and at length lost itself under an arch of frightful rocks which reached to the sky. The two travellers had the courage to commit themselves to the current. The river, suddenly contracting at this place, whirled them along with a dreadful noise and rapidity. At the end of four-and-twenty hours they saw daylight again, but their canoe was dashed to pieces against the rocks. For a league they had to creep from rock to rock, until at length they discovered an extensive plain, bounded by inaccessible mountains. The country was cultivated as much for pleasure as for necessity. On all sides the useful was also the beautiful.
<p/>The roads were covered, or rather adorned, with carriages of a glittering form and substance, in which were men and women of surprising beauty, drawn by large red sheep which surpassed in fleetness the finest coursers of Andalusia, Tetuan, and Mequinez.-LSB-18-RSB- '' Here, however, is a country,'' said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``which is better than Westphalia. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) stepped out with Cacambo towards the first village which he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) saw. Some children dressed in tattered brocades played at quoits on the outskirts. Our travellers from the other world amused themselves by looking on. The quoits were large round pieces, yellow, red, and green, which cast a singular lustre! The travellers picked a few of them off the ground; this was of gold, that of emeralds, the other of rubies--the least of them would have been the greatest ornament on the Mogul's throne. <div class="bookquote">``Without doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>said Cacambo, <div class="bookquote">``these children must be the king's sons that are playing at quoits! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>The village schoolmaster appeared at this moment and called them to school. '' There,'' said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``is the preceptor of the royal family. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The truants</b></font>)</div>The little truants immediately quitted their game, leaving the quoits on the ground with all their other playthings. Candide gathered them up, ran to the master, and presented them to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) in a most humble manner, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to understand by signs that their royal highnesses had forgotten their gold and jewels. The schoolmaster, smiling, flung them upon the ground; then, looking at Candide with a good deal of surprise, went about his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) business. The travellers, however, took care to gather up the gold, the rubies, and the emeralds. <div class="bookquote">``Where are we? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Candide. <div class="bookquote">``The king's children in this country must be well brought up, since they are taught to despise gold and precious stones.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>Cacambo was as much surprised as Candide. At length they drew near the first house in the village. It was built like an European palace. A crowd of people pressed about the door, and there were still more in the house. They heard most agreeable music, and were aware of a delicious odour of cooking. Cacambo went up to the door and heard they were talking Peruvian; it was his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) mother tongue, for it is well known that Cacambo was born in Tucuman, in a village where no other language was spoken. <div class="bookquote">``I will be your interpreter here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) to Candide; <div class="bookquote">``let us go in, it is a public-house.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Immediately two waiters and two girls, dressed in cloth of gold, and their hair tied up with ribbons, invited them to sit down to table with the landlord. They served four dishes of soup, each garnished with two young parrots; a boiled condor-LSB-19-RSB- which weighed two hundred pounds; two roasted monkeys, of excellent flavour; three hundred humming-birds in one dish, and six hundred fly-birds in another; exquisite ragouts; delicious pastries; the whole served up in dishes of a kind of rock-crystal. The waiters and girls poured out several liqueurs drawn from the sugar-cane. Most of the company were chapmen and waggoners, all extremely polite; they asked Cacambo a few questions with the greatest circumspection, and answered his (<font color='blue'><b>girls</b></font>) in the most obliging manner. As soon as dinner was over, Cacambo believed as well as Candide that they might well pay their reckoning by laying down two of those large gold pieces which they had picked up. The landlord and landlady shouted with laughter and held their sides. When the fit was over: <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the landlord, <div class="bookquote">``it is plain you are strangers, and such guests
<p/>we are not accustomed to see; pardon us therefore for laughing when you offered us the pebbles from our highroads in payment of your reckoning. You doubtless have not the money of the country; but it is not necessary to have any money at all to dine in this house. All hostelries established for the convenience of commerce are paid by the government. You have fared but very indifferently because this is a poor village; but everywhere else, you will be received as you deserve. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>Cacambo explained this whole discourse with great astonishment to Candide, who was as greatly astonished to hear it. <div class="bookquote">``What sort of a country then is this,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said they to one another; <div class="bookquote">``a country unknown to all the rest of the world, and where nature is of a kind so different from ours? It is probably the country where all is well; for there absolutely must be one such place. And, whatever Master Pangloss might say, I often found that things went very ill in Westphalia.''  (<font color='red'><b>THEY</b></font>)</div>XVIII WHAT THEY SAW IN THE COUNTRY OF EL DORADO. Cacambo expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>DORADO</b></font>) curiosity to the landlord, who made answer: <div class="bookquote">``I am very ignorant, but not the worse on that account. However, we have in this neighbourhood an old man retired from Court who is the most learned and most communicative person in the kingdom. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>At once he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took Cacambo to the old man. Candide acted now only a second character, and accompanied his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) valet. They entered a very plain house, for the door was only of silver, and the ceilings were only of gold, but wrought in so elegant a taste as to vie with the richest.
<p/>The antechamber, indeed, was only encrusted with rubies and emeralds, but the order in which everything was arranged made amends for this great simplicity. The old man received the strangers on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sofa, which was stuffed with humming-birds' feathers, and ordered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) servants to present them with liqueurs in diamond goblets; after which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) satisfied their curiosity in the following terms: ``I am now one hundred and seventy-two years old, and I learnt of my late father, Master of the Horse to the King, the amazing revolutions of Peru, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had been an eyewitness. The kingdom we now inhabit is the ancient country of the Incas, who quitted it very imprudently to conquer another part of the world, and were at length destroyed by the Spaniards. <div class="bookquote">``More wise by far were the princes of their family, who remained in their native country; and they ordained, with the consent of the whole nation, that none of the inhabitants should ever be permitted to quit this little kingdom; and this has preserved our innocence and happiness. The Spaniards have had a confused notion of this country, and have called it El Dorado ; and an Englishman, whose name was Sir Walter Raleigh, came very near it about a hundred years ago; but being surrounded by inaccessible rocks and precipices, we have hitherto been sheltered from the rapaciousness of European nations, who have an inconceivable passion for the pebbles and dirt of our land, for the sake of which they would murder us to the last man. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The conversation was long: it turned chiefly on their form of government, their manners, their women, their public entertainments, and the arts. At length Candide, having always had a taste for metaphysics, made Cacambo ask whether there was any religion in that country.
<p/>The old man reddened a little. '' How then,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``can you doubt it? Do you take us for ungrateful wretches? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Cacambo humbly asked, <div class="bookquote">``What was the religion in El Dorado?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>The old man reddened again. <div class="bookquote">``Can there be two religions?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We have, I believe, the religion of all the world: we worship God night and morning.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you worship but one God?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>said Cacambo, who still acted as interpreter in representing Candide's doubts. '' Surely,'' said the old man, <div class="bookquote">``there are not two, nor three, nor four. I must confess the people from your side of the world ask very extraordinary questions. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Candide was not yet tired of interrogating the good old man; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to know in what manner they prayed to God in El Dorado. <div class="bookquote">``We do not pray to Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the sage</b></font>)</div>said the worthy sage; <div class="bookquote">``we have nothing to ask of Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has given us all we need, and we return Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thanks without ceasing. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the sage</b></font>)</div>Candide having a curiosity to see the priests asked where they were. The good old man smiled. '' My friend,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we are all priests. The King and all the heads of families sing solemn canticles of thanksgiving every morning, accompanied by five or six thousand musicians.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What! have you no monks who teach, who dispute, who govern, who cabal, and who burn people that are not of their opinion?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We must be mad, indeed, if that were the case,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man; <div class="bookquote">``here we are all of one opinion, and we know not what you mean by monks. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>During this whole discourse Candide was in raptures, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to himself: <div class="bookquote">``This is vastly different from Westphalia and the Baron's castle.
<p/>Had our friend Pangloss seen El Dorado he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would no longer have said that the castle of Thunder-ten-Tronckh was the finest upon earth. It is evident that one must travel.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>After this long conversation the old man ordered a coach and six sheep to be got ready, and twelve of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) domestics to conduct the travellers to Court. '' Excuse me,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if my age deprives me of the honour of accompanying you. The King will receive you in a manner that cannot displease you; and no doubt you will make an allowance for the customs of the country, if some things should not be to your liking.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Candide and Cacambo got into the coach, the six sheep flew, and in less than four hours they reached the King's palace situated at the extremity of the capital. The portal was two hundred and twenty feet high, and one hundred wide; but words are wanting to express the materials of which it was built. It is plain such materials must have prodigious superiority over those pebbles and sand which we call gold and precious stones. Twenty beautiful damsels of the King's guard received Candide and Cacambo as they alighted from the coach, conducted them to the bath, and dressed them in robes woven of the down of humming-birds; after which the great crown officers, of both sexes, led them to the King's apartment, between two files of musicians, a thousand on each side.
<p/>When they drew near to the audience chamber Cacambo asked one of the great officers in what way he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) should pay his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) obeisance to his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) Majesty; whether they should throw themselves upon their knees or on their stomachs; whether they should put their hands upon their heads or behind their backs; whether they should lick the dust off the floor; in a word, what was the ceremony? '' The custom,'' said the great officer, <div class="bookquote">``is to embrace the King, and to kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) on each cheek. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>Candide and Cacambo threw themselves round his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) Majesty's neck. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) received them with all the goodness imaginable, and politely invited them to supper. While waiting they were shown the city, and saw the public edifices raised as high as the clouds, the market places ornamented with a thousand columns, the fountains of spring water, those of rose water, those of liqueurs drawn from sugar-cane, incessantly flowing into the great squares, which were paved with a kind of precious stone, which gave off a delicious fragrancy like that of cloves and cinnamon. Candide asked to see the court of justice, the parliament. They told him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) they had none, and that they were strangers to lawsuits. He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) asked if they had any prisons, and they answered no. But what surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) most and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) the greatest pleasure was the palace of sciences, where he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) saw a gallery two thousand feet long, and filled with instruments employed in mathematics and physics. After rambling about the city the whole afternoon, and seeing but a thousandth part of it, they were reconducted to the royal palace, where Candide sat down to table with his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) Majesty, his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) valet Cacambo, and several ladies.
<p/>Never was there a better entertainment, and never was more wit shown at a table than that which fell from his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) Majesty. Cacambo explained the King's bon-mots to Candide, and notwithstanding they were translated they still appeared to be bon-mots . Of all the things that surprised Candide this was not the least. They spent a month in this hospitable place. Candide frequently said to Cacambo: <div class="bookquote">``I own, my friend, once more that the castle where I was born is nothing in comparison with this; but, after all, Miss Cunegonde is not here, and you have, without doubt, some mistress in Europe. If we abide here we shall only be upon a footing with the rest, whereas, if we return to our old world, only with twelve sheep laden with the pebbles of El Dorado, we shall be richer than all the kings in Europe. We shall have no more Inquisitors to fear, and we may easily recover Miss Cunegonde. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>This speech was agreeable to Cacambo; mankind are so fond of roving, of making a figure in their own country, and of boasting of what they have seen in their travels, that the two happy ones resolved to be no longer so, but to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) Majesty's leave to quit the country. <div class="bookquote">``You are foolish,''  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>said the King. <div class="bookquote">``I am sensible that my kingdom is but a small place, but when a person is comfortably settled in any part he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) should abide there. I have not the right to detain strangers. It is a tyranny which neither our manners nor our laws permit. All men are free. Go when you wish, but the going will be very difficult.
<p/>It is impossible to ascend that rapid river on which you came as by a miracle, and which runs under vaulted rocks. The mountains which surround my kingdom are ten thousand feet high, and as steep as walls; they are each over ten leagues in breadth, and there is no other way to descend them than by precipices. However, since you absolutely wish to depart, I shall give orders to my engineers to construct a machine that will convey you very safely. When we have conducted you over the mountains no one can accompany you further, for my subjects have made a vow never to quit the kingdom, and they are too wise to break it. Ask me besides anything that you please.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We desire nothing of your Majesty,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Candide, <div class="bookquote">``but a few sheep laden with provisions, pebbles, and the earth of this country. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The King</b></font>)</div>The King laughed. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot conceive,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``what pleasure you Europeans find in our yellow clay, but take as much as you like, and great good may it do you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At once he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) gave directions that his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) engineers should construct a machine to hoist up these two extraordinary men out of the kingdom. Three thousand good mathematicians went to work; it was ready in fifteen days, and did not cost more than twenty million sterling in the specie of that country. They placed Candide and Cacambo on the machine. There were two great red sheep saddled and bridled to ride upon as soon as they were beyond the mountains, twenty pack-sheep laden with provisions, thirty with presents of the curiosities of the country, and fifty with gold, diamonds, and precious stones. The King embraced the two wanderers very tenderly.
<p/>Their departure, with the ingenious manner in which they and their sheep were hoisted over the mountains, was a splendid spectacle. The mathematicians took their leave after conveying them to a place of safety, and Candide had no other desire, no other aim, than to present his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sheep to Miss Cunegonde. '' Now,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we are able to pay the Governor of Buenos Ayres if Miss Cunegonde can be ransomed. Let us journey towards Cayenne. Let us embark, and we will afterwards see what kingdom we shall be able to purchase.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>XIX WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM AT SURINAM AND HOW CANDIDE GOT ACQUAINTED WITH MARTIN. Our travellers spent the first day very agreeably. They were delighted with possessing more treasure than all Asia, Europe, and Africa could scrape together. Candide, in his (<font color='blue'><b>MARTIN</b></font>) raptures, cut Cunegonde's name on the trees. The second day two of their sheep plunged into a morass, where they and their burdens were lost; two more died of fatigue a few days after; seven or eight perished with hunger in a desert; and others subsequently fell down precipices. At length, after travelling a hundred days, only two sheep remained. Said Candide to Cacambo: <div class="bookquote">``My friend, you see how perishable are the riches of this world; there is nothing solid but virtue, and the happiness of seeing Cunegonde once more.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I grant all you say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>said Cacambo, <div class="bookquote">``but we have still two sheep remaining, with more treasure than the King of Spain will ever have; and I see a town which I take to be Surinam, belonging to the Dutch. We are at the end of all our troubles, and at the beginning of happiness.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div><p/>As they drew near the town, they saw a negro stretched upon the ground, with only one moiety of his (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) clothes, that is, of his (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) blue linen drawers; the poor man had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) left leg and his (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) right hand. '' Good God!'' said Candide in Dutch, <div class="bookquote">``what art thou doing there, friend, in that shocking condition?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dutch</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am waiting for my master, Mynheer Vanderdendur, the famous merchant,''  (<font color='red'><b>the negro</b></font>)</div>answered the negro. '' Was it Mynheer Vanderdendur,'' said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``that treated thee thus?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the negro</b></font>)</div>said the negro, <div class="bookquote">``it is the custom. They give us a pair of linen drawers for our whole garment twice a year. When we work at the sugar-canes, and the mill snatches hold of a finger, they cut off the hand; and when we attempt to run away, they cut off the leg; both cases have happened to me. This is the price at which you eat sugar in Europe. Yet when my mother sold me for ten patagons-LSB-20-RSB- on the coast of Guinea, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said to me: `My dear child, bless our fetiches, adore them for ever; they will make thee live happily; thou hast the honour of being the slave of our lords, the whites, which is making the fortune of thy father and mother.' Alas! I know not whether I have made their fortunes; this I know, that they have not made mine. Dogs, monkeys, and parrots are a thousand times less wretched than I. The Dutch fetiches, who have converted me, declare every Sunday that we are all of us children of Adam--blacks as well as whites. I am not a genealogist, but if these preachers tell truth, we are all second cousins. Now, you must agree, that it is impossible to treat one's relations in a more barbarous manner.''  (<font color='red'><b>the negro</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Pangloss!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Candide, <div class="bookquote">``thou hadst not guessed at this abomination; it is the end. I must at last renounce thy optimism.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What is this optimism?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>said Cacambo. <div class="bookquote">``Alas! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``it is the madness of maintaining that everything is right when it is wrong.''  (<font color='red'><b>the negro</b></font>)</div>Looking at the negro, he (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) shed tears, and weeping, he (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) entered Surinam. The first thing they inquired after was whether there was a vessel in the harbour which could be sent to Buenos Ayres. The person to whom they applied was a Spanish sea-captain, who offered to agree with them upon reasonable terms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) appointed to meet them at a public-house, whither Candide and the faithful Cacambo went with their two sheep, and awaited his (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) coming. Candide, who had his (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) heart upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) lips, told the Spaniard all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) adventures, and avowed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) intended to elope with Miss Cunegonde. <div class="bookquote">``Then I will take good care not to carry you to Buenos Ayres,''  (<font color='red'><b>the seaman</b></font>)</div>said the seaman. <div class="bookquote">``I should be hanged, and so would you. The fair Cunegonde is my lord's favourite mistress. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This was a thunderclap for Candide: he (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) wept for a long while. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) drew Cacambo aside. '' Here, my dear friend,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``this thou must do. We have, each of us in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pocket, five or six millions in diamonds; you are more clever than I; you must go and bring Miss Cunegonde from Buenos Ayres. If the Governor makes any difficulty, give him (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) a million; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) will not relinquish her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), give him (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) two; as you have not killed an Inquisitor, they will have no suspicion of you; I'll get another ship, and go and wait for you at Venice; that's a free country, where there is no danger either from Bulgarians, Abares, Jews, or Inquisitors.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Cacambo applauded this wise resolution. He (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) despaired at parting from so good a master, who had become his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) intimate friend; but the pleasure of serving him (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) prevailed over the pain of leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>). They embraced with tears; Candide charged him (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) not to forget the good old woman. Cacambo set out that very same day. This Cacambo was a very honest fellow. Candide stayed some time longer in Surinam, waiting for another captain to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) and the two remaining sheep to Italy. After he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had hired domestics, and purchased everything necessary for a long voyage, Mynheer Vanderdendur, captain of a large vessel, came and offered his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) services. <div class="bookquote">``How much will you charge,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) to this man, <div class="bookquote">``to carry me straight to Venice--me, my servants, my baggage, and these two sheep? ''  (<font color='red'><b>this man</b></font>)</div>The skipper asked ten thousand piastres. Candide did not hesitate. '' Oh! oh! '' said the prudent Vanderdendur to himself, <div class="bookquote">``this stranger gives ten thousand piastres unhesitatingly! He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) must be very rich. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynheer Vanderdendur/Vanderdendur</b></font>)</div>Returning a little while after, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) know that upon second consideration, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) could not undertake the voyage for less than twenty thousand piastres. '' Well, you shall have them,'' said Candide. '' Ay!'' said the skipper to himself, <div class="bookquote">``this man agrees to pay twenty thousand piastres with as much ease as ten.''  (<font color='red'><b>the skipper</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went back to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again, and declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not carry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to Venice for less than thirty thousand piastres. '' Then you shall have thirty thousand,'' replied Candide. '' Oh! oh! '' said the Dutch skipper once more to himself, <div class="bookquote">``thirty thousand piastres are a trifle to this man; surely these sheep must be laden with an immense treasure; let us say no more about it.
<p/>First of all, let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pay down the thirty thousand piastres; then we shall see. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the skipper sheep</b></font>)</div>Candide sold two small diamonds, the least of which was worth more than what the skipper asked for his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) freight. He (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) paid him (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) in advance. The two sheep were put on board. Candide followed in a little boat to join the vessel in the roads. The skipper seized his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) opportunity, set sail, and put out to sea, the wind favouring him (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>). Candide, dismayed and stupefied, soon lost sight of the vessel. '' Alas!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``this is a trick worthy of the old world!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) put back, overwhelmed with sorrow, for indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) had lost sufficient to make the fortune of twenty monarchs. He (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) waited upon the Dutch magistrate, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) distress he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) knocked over loudly at the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) entered and told his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) adventure, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) voice with unnecessary vehemence. The magistrate began by fining him (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) ten thousand piastres for making a noise; then he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) listened patiently, promised to examine into his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) affair at the skipper's return, and ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) to pay ten thousand piastres for the expense of the hearing. This drove Candide to despair; he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) had, indeed, endured misfortunes a thousand times worse; the coolness of the magistrate and of the skipper who had robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>), roused his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) choler and flung him (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) into a deep melancholy. The villainy of mankind presented itself before his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) imagination in all its deformity, and his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) mind was filled with gloomy ideas. At length hearing that a French vessel was ready to set sail for Bordeaux, as he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) had no sheep laden with diamonds to take along with him (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) hired a cabin at the usual price.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) made it known in the town that he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) would pay the passage and board and give two thousand piastres to any honest man who would make the voyage with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), upon condition that this man was the most dissatisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) state, and the most unfortunate in the whole province. Such a crowd of candidates presented themselves that a fleet of ships could hardly have held them. Candide being desirous of selecting from among the best, marked out about one-twentieth of them who seemed to be sociable men, and who all pretended to merit his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) preference. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) assembled them at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inn, and gave them a supper on condition that each took an oath to relate his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) history faithfully, promising to choose him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who appeared to be most justly discontented with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) state, and to bestow some presents upon the rest. They sat until four o'clock in the morning. Candide, in listening to all their adventures, was reminded of what the old woman had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in their voyage to Buenos Ayres, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wager that there was not a person on board the ship but had met with very great misfortunes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) dreamed of Pangloss at every adventure told to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>). '' This Pangloss,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``would be puzzled to demonstrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) system. I wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) were here. Certainly, if all things are good, it is in El Dorado and not in the rest of the world. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) made choice of a poor man of letters, who had worked ten years for the booksellers of Amsterdam. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) judged that there was not in the whole world a trade which could disgust one more.
<p/>This philosopher was an honest man; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been robbed by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, beaten by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son, and abandoned by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter who got a Portuguese to run away with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had just been deprived of a small employment, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) subsisted; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was persecuted by the preachers of Surinam, who took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for a Socinian. We must allow that the others were at least as wretched as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but Candide hoped that the philosopher would entertain him (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) during the voyage. All the other candidates complained that Candide had done them great injustice; but he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) appeased them by giving one hundred piastres to each. XX WHAT HAPPENED AT SEA TO CANDIDE AND MARTIN. The old philosopher, whose name was Martin, embarked then with Candide for Bordeaux. They had both seen and suffered a great deal; and if the vessel had sailed from Surinam to Japan, by the Cape of Good Hope, the subject of moral and natural evil would have enabled them to entertain one another during the whole voyage. Candide, however, had one great advantage over Martin, in that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) always hoped to see Miss Cunegonde; whereas Martin had nothing at all to hope. Besides, Candide was possessed of money and jewels, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had lost one hundred large red sheep, laden with the greatest treasure upon earth; though the knavery of the Dutch skipper still sat heavy upon his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) mind; yet when he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) reflected upon what he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) had still left, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) mentioned the name of Cunegonde, especially towards the latter end of a repast, he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) inclined to Pangloss's doctrine. '' But you, Mr. Martin,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) to the philosopher, <div class="bookquote">``what do you think of all this? what are your ideas on moral and natural evil?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the philosopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>answered Martin, <div class="bookquote">``our priests accused me of being a Socinian, but the real fact is I am a Manichean. '' (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>-LSB-21-RSB- <div class="bookquote">``You jest,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide; <div class="bookquote">``there are no longer Manicheans in the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot help it; I know not how to think otherwise.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Surely you must be possessed by the devil,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) is so deeply concerned in the affairs of this world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>answered Martin, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) may very well be in me, as well as in everybody else; but I own to you that when I cast an eye on this globe, or rather on this little ball, I cannot help thinking that God has abandoned it to some malignant being. I except, always, El Dorado. I scarcely ever knew a city that did not desire the destruction of a neighbouring city, nor a family that did not wish to exterminate some other family. Everywhere the weak execrate the powerful, before whom they cringe; and the powerful beat them like sheep whose wool and flesh they sell. A million regimented assassins, from one extremity of Europe to the other, get their bread by disciplined depredation and murder, for want of more honest employment. Even in those cities which seem to enjoy peace, and where the arts flourish, the inhabitants are devoured by more envy, care, and uneasiness than are experienced by a besieged town. Secret griefs are more cruel than public calamities. In a word I have seen so much, and experienced so much that I am a Manichean.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There are, however, some things good,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide. <div class="bookquote">``That may be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin; '' but I know them not. '' In the middle of this dispute they heard the report of cannon; it redoubled every instant. Each took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) glass.
<p/>They saw two ships in close fight about three miles off. The wind brought both so near to the French vessel that our travellers had the pleasure of seeing the fight at their ease. At length one let off a broadside, so low and so truly aimed, that the other sank to the bottom. Candide and Martin could plainly perceive a hundred men on the deck of the sinking vessel; they raised their hands to heaven and uttered terrible outcries, and the next moment were swallowed up by the sea. '' Well,'' said Martin, <div class="bookquote">``this is how men treat one another.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide; <div class="bookquote">``there is something diabolical in this affair. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>While speaking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) knew not what, of a shining red, swimming close to the vessel. They put out the long-boat to see what it could be: it was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) sheep! Candide was more rejoiced at the recovery of this one sheep than he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had been grieved at the loss of the hundred laden with the large diamonds of El Dorado. The French captain soon saw that the captain of the victorious vessel was a Spaniard, and that the other was a Dutch pirate, and the very same one who had robbed Candide. The immense plunder which this villain had amassed, was buried with him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) in the sea, and out of the whole only one sheep was saved. <div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Candide to Martin, <div class="bookquote">``that crime is sometimes punished. This rogue of a Dutch skipper has met with the fate he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) deserved.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin; <div class="bookquote">``but why should the passengers be doomed also to destruction? God has punished the knave, and the devil has drowned the rest.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>The French and Spanish ships continued their course, and Candide continued his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) conversation with Martin.
<p/>They disputed fifteen successive days, and on the last of those fifteen days, they were as far advanced as on the first. But, however, they chatted, they communicated ideas, they consoled each other. Candide caressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) sheep. <div class="bookquote">``Since I have found thee again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I may likewise chance to find my Cunegonde.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>XXI CANDIDE AND MARTIN, REASONING, DRAW NEAR THE COAST OF FRANCE. At length they descried the coast of France. '' Were you ever in France, Mr. Martin?'' said Candide. '' Yes,'' said Martin, <div class="bookquote">``I have been in several provinces. In some one-half of the people are fools, in others they are too cunning; in some they are weak and simple, in others they affect to be witty; in all, the principal occupation is love, the next is slander, and the third is talking nonsense.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But, Mr. Martin, have you seen Paris?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have. All these kinds are found there. It is a chaos--a confused multitude, where everybody seeks pleasure and scarcely any one finds it, at least as it appeared to me. I made a short stay there. On my arrival I was robbed of all I had by pickpockets at the fair of St. Germain. I myself was taken for a robber and was imprisoned for eight days, after which I served as corrector of the press to gain the money necessary for my return to Holland on foot. I knew the whole scribbling rabble, the party rabble, the fanatic rabble. It is said that there are very polite people in that city, and I wish to believe it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``For my part, I have no curiosity to see France,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide. <div class="bookquote">``You may easily imagine that after spending a month at El Dorado I can desire to behold nothing upon earth but Miss Cunegonde.
<p/>I go to await her (<font color='blue'><b>rabble</b></font>) at Venice. We shall pass through France on our way to Italy. Will you bear me company?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin. <div class="bookquote">``It is said that Venice is fit only for its own nobility, but that strangers meet with a very good reception if they have a good deal of money. I have none of it; you have, therefore I will follow you all over the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But do you believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``that the earth was originally a sea, as we find it asserted in that large book belonging to the captain?''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do not believe a word of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin, <div class="bookquote">``any more than I do of the many ravings which have been published lately.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But for what end, then, has this world been formed?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide. '' To plague us to death,'' answered Martin. <div class="bookquote">``Are you not greatly surprised,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued Candide, <div class="bookquote">``at the love which these two girls of the Oreillons had for those monkeys, of which I have already told you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin. <div class="bookquote">``I do not see that that passion was strange. I have seen so many extraordinary things that I have ceased to be surprised.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``that men have always massacred each other as they do to-day, that they have always been liars, cheats, traitors, ingrates, brigands, idiots, thieves, scoundrels, gluttons, drunkards, misers, envious, ambitious, bloody-minded, calumniators, debauchees, fanatics, hypocrites, and fools?''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin, <div class="bookquote">``that hawks have always eaten pigeons when they have found them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, without doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide. '' Well, then,'' said Martin, <div class="bookquote">``if hawks have always had the same character why should you imagine that men may have changed theirs?''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``there is a vast deal of difference, for free will--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div>And reasoning thus they arrived at Bordeaux. XXII WHAT HAPPENED IN FRANCE TO CANDIDE AND MARTIN. Candide stayed in Bordeaux no longer than was necessary for the selling of a few of the pebbles of El Dorado, and for hiring a good chaise to hold two passengers; for he (<font color='blue'><b>MARTIN</b></font>) could not travel without his (<font color='blue'><b>MARTIN</b></font>) Philosopher Martin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was only vexed at parting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) sheep, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) left to the Bordeaux Academy of Sciences, who set as a subject for that year's prize, <div class="bookquote">``to find why this sheep's wool was red;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the prize was awarded to a learned man of the North, who demonstrated by A plus B minus C divided by Z, that the sheep must be red, and die of the rot. Meanwhile, all the travellers whom Candide met in the inns along his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) route, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``We go to Paris. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>This general eagerness at length gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), too, a desire to see this capital; and it was not so very great a détour from the road to Venice. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entered Paris by the suburb of St. Marceau, and fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marceau</b></font>) was in the dirtiest village of Westphalia. Scarcely was Candide arrived at his (<font color='blue'><b>Marceau</b></font>) inn, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Marceau</b></font>) found himself attacked by a slight illness, caused by fatigue. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Marceau</b></font>) had a very large diamond on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marceau</b></font>) finger, and the people of the inn had taken notice of a prodigiously heavy box among his (<font color='blue'><b>Marceau</b></font>) baggage, there were two physicians to attend him (<font color='blue'><b>Marceau</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Marceau</b></font>) had never sent for them, and two devotees who warmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Marceau</b></font>) broths. <div class="bookquote">``I remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>Martin said, <div class="bookquote">``also to have been sick at Paris in my first voyage; I was very poor, thus I had neither friends, devotees, nor doctors, and I recovered.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><p/>However, what with physic and bleeding, Candide's illness became serious. A parson of the neighborhood came with great meekness to ask for a bill for the other world payable to the bearer. Candide would do nothing for him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>); but the devotees assured him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) it was the new fashion. He (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) was not a man of fashion. Martin wished to throw the priest out of the window. The priest swore that they would not bury Candide. Martin swore that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) would bury the priest if he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) continued to be troublesome. The quarrel grew heated. Martin took him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) by the shoulders and roughly turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) out of doors; which occasioned great scandal and a law-suit. Candide got well again, and during his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) convalescence he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had very good company to sup with him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). They played high. Candide wondered why it was that the ace never came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>); but Martin was not at all astonished. Among those who did him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) the honours of the town was a little Abbé of Perigord, one of those busybodies who are ever alert, officious, forward, fawning, and complaisant; who watch for strangers in their passage through the capital, tell them the scandalous history of the town, and offer them pleasure at all prices. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) first took Candide and Martin to La Comé die, where they played a new tragedy. Candide happened to be seated near some of the fashionable wits. This did not prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) shedding tears at the well-acted scenes. One of these critics at his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) side said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) between the acts: '' Your tears are misplaced; that is a shocking actress; the actor who plays with her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) is yet worse; and the play is still worse than the actors.
<p/>The author does not know a word of Arabic, yet the scene is in Arabia; moreover he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) is a man that does not believe in innate ideas; and I will bring you, to-morrow, twenty pamphlets written against him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>).''-LSB-22-RSB- <div class="bookquote">``How many dramas have you in France, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Abbé</b></font>)</div>said Candide to the Abbé. <div class="bookquote">``Five or six thousand.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What a number!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide. <div class="bookquote">``How many good?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fifteen or sixteen,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the other. '' What a number!'' said Martin. Candide was very pleased with an actress who played Queen Elizabeth in a somewhat insipid tragedy-LSB-23-RSB- sometimes acted.

(<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>The Perigordian Abbé offered to introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>).

(<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That was very uncivil,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide. <div class="bookquote">``What would you have?''

(<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is it true that they always laugh in Paris?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide.

(<font color='red'><b>the Abbé</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``is that great pig who spoke so ill of the piece at which I wept, and of the actors who gave me so much pleasure?''

'' (<font color='red'><b>the Abbé</b></font>)</div>-LSB-25-RSB- Thus Candide, Martin, and the Perigordian conversed on the staircase, while watching every one go out after the performance. '' Although I am eager to see Cunegonde again,'' said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``I should like to sup with Miss Clairon, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Clairon</b></font>) appears to me admirable. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div>The Abbé was not the man to approach Miss Clairon, who saw only good company. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Clairon</b></font>) is engaged for this evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but I shall have the honour to take you to the house of a lady of quality, and there you will know Paris as if you had lived in it for years.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Candide, who was naturally curious, let himself be taken to this lady's house, at the end of the Faubourg St. Honoré.
<p/>The company was occupied in playing faro; a dozen melancholy punters held each in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand a little pack of cards; a bad record of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) misfortunes. Profound silence reigned; pallor was on the faces of the punters, anxiety on that of the banker, and the hostess, sitting near the unpitying banker, noticed with lynx-eyes all the doubled and other increased stakes, as each player dog's-eared his (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) cards; she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) made them turn down the edges again with severe, but polite attention; she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) showed no vexation for fear of losing her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) customers. The lady insisted upon being called the Marchioness of Parolignac. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughter, aged fifteen, was among the punters, and notified with a covert glance the cheatings of the poor people who tried to repair the cruelties of fate. The Perigordian Abbé, Candide and Martin entered; no one rose, no one saluted them, no one looked at them; all were profoundly occupied with their cards. '' The Baroness of Thunder-ten-Tronckh was more polite,'' said Candide. However, the Abbé whispered to the Marchioness, who half rose, honoured Candide with a gracious smile, and Martin with a condescending nod; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) gave a seat and a pack of cards to Candide, who lost fifty thousand francs in two deals, after which they supped very gaily, and every one was astonished that Candide was not moved by his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) loss; the servants said among themselves, in the language of servants:-- <div class="bookquote">``Some English lord is here this evening.''  (<font color='red'><b>servants</b></font>)</div>The supper passed at first like most Parisian suppers, in silence, followed by a noise of words which could not be distinguished, then with pleasantries of which most were insipid, with false news, with bad reasoning, a little politics, and much evil speaking; they also discussed new books. ''
<p/>Have you seen,'' said the Perigordian Abbé, <div class="bookquote">``the romance of Sieur Gauchat, doctor of divinity?'' (<font color='red'><b>Perigordian Abbé/Abbé</b></font>)</div>-LSB-26-RSB- <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the guests</b></font>)</div>answered one of the guests, <div class="bookquote">``but I have not been able to finish it.

''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marchioness</b></font>)</div>There was at table a wise man of taste, who supported the Marchioness. They spoke afterwards of tragedies; the lady asked why there were tragedies which were sometimes played and which could not be read.
<p/>The man of taste explained very well how a piece could have some interest, and have almost no merit; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) proved in few words that it was not enough to introduce one or two of those situations which one finds in all romances, and which always seduce the spectator, but that it was necessary to be new without being odd, often sublime and always natural, to know the human heart and to make it speak; to be a great poet without allowing any person in the piece to appear to be a poet; to know language perfectly--to speak it with purity, with continuous harmony and without rhythm ever taking anything from sense. <div class="bookquote">``Whoever,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>added he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``does not observe all these rules can produce one or two tragedies, applauded at a theatre, but he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) will never be counted in the ranks of good writers. There are very few good tragedies; some are idylls in dialogue, well written and well rhymed, others political reasonings which lull to sleep, or amplifications which repel; others demoniac dreams in barbarous style, interrupted in sequence, with long apostrophes to the gods, because they do not know how to speak to men, with false maxims, with bombastic commonplaces!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Candide listened with attention to this discourse, and conceived a great idea of the speaker, and as the Marchioness had taken care to place him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) beside her (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) leaned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) and took the liberty of asking who was the man who had spoken so well. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a scholar,'' said the lady, <div class="bookquote">``who does not play, whom the Abbé sometimes brings to supper; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is perfectly at home among tragedies and books, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has written a tragedy which was hissed, and a book of which nothing has ever been seen outside his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bookseller's shop excepting the copy which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dedicated to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The great man!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said Candide. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is another Pangloss!'' Then, turning towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Sir, you think doubtless that all is for the best in the moral and physical world, and that nothing could be otherwise than it is?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>the scholar</b></font>)</div>answered the scholar, <div class="bookquote">``I know nothing of all that; I find that all goes awry with me; that no one knows either what is his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) rank, nor what is his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) condition, what he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) does nor what he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) ought to do; and that except supper, which is always gay, and where there appears to be enough concord, all the rest of the time is passed in impertinent quarrels; Jansenist against Molinist, Parliament against the Church, men of letters against men of letters, courtesans against courtesans, financiers against the people, wives against husbands, relatives against relatives--it is eternal war.''  (<font color='red'><b>the scholar</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have seen the worst,''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div>Candide replied. '' But a wise man, who since has had the misfortune to be hanged, taught me that all is marvellously well; these are but the shadows on a beautiful picture.'' <div class="bookquote">``Your hanged man mocked the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin. <div class="bookquote">``The shadows are horrible blots.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They are men who make the blots,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``and they cannot be dispensed with.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is not their fault then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin. Most of the punters, who understood nothing of this language, drank, and Martin reasoned with the scholar, and Candide related some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) adventures to his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) hostess.
<p/>After supper the Marchioness took Candide into her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) boudoir, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) sit upon a sofa. '' Ah, well!'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you love desperately Miss Cunegonde of Thunder-ten-Tronckh?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Candide. The Marchioness replied to him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) with a tender smile: <div class="bookquote">``You answer me like a young man from Westphalia.

(<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Alas! madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``I will answer you as you wish.''

I sometimes make my Parisian lovers languish for fifteen days, but I give myself to you the first night because one must do the honours of one's country to a young man from Westphalia. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The lady having perceived two enormous diamonds upon the hands of the young foreigner praised them with such good faith that from Candide's fingers they passed to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own. Candide, returning with the Perigordian Abbé, felt some remorse in having been unfaithful to Miss Cunegonde. The Abbé sympathised in his (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) trouble; he (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) had had but a light part of the fifty thousand francs lost at play and of the value of the two brilliants, half given, half extorted. His (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) design was to profit as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) could by the advantages which the acquaintance of Candide could procure for him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) spoke much of Cunegonde, and Candide told him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) should ask forgiveness of that beautiful one for his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) infidelity when he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) should see her (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) in Venice. The Abbé redoubled his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) politeness and attentions, and took a tender interest in all that Candide said, in all that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) did, in all that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) wished to do. '' And so, sir, you have a rendezvous at Venice?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, monsieur Abbé,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Candide. <div class="bookquote">``It is absolutely necessary that I go to meet Miss Cunegonde.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then the pleasure of talking of that which he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) loved induced him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) to relate, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) custom, part of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) adventures with the fair Westphalian. <div class="bookquote">``I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Abbé</b></font>)</div>said the Abbé, <div class="bookquote">``that Miss Cunegonde has a great deal of wit, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) writes charming letters?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Abbé</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have never received any from her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``for being expelled from the castle on her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) account I had not an opportunity for writing to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). Soon after that I heard she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was dead; then I found her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) alive; then I lost her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) again; and last of all, I sent an express to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) two thousand five hundred leagues from here, and I wait for an answer. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The Abbé</b></font>)</div>The Abbé listened attentively, and seemed to be in a brown study. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) soon took his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) leave of the two foreigners after a most tender embrace. The following day Candide received, on awaking, a letter couched in these terms: <div class="bookquote">``My very dear love, for eight days I have been ill in this town. I learn that you are here. I would fly to your arms if I could but move. I was informed of your passage at Bordeaux, where I left faithful Cacambo and the old woman, who are to follow me very soon.
<p/>The Governor of Buenos Ayres has taken all, but there remains to me your heart. Come! your presence will either give me life or kill me with pleasure. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>This charming, this unhoped-for letter transported Candide with an inexpressible joy, and the illness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) dear Cunegonde overwhelmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) with grief. Divided between those two passions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) gold and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) diamonds and hurried away, with Martin, to the hotel where Miss Cunegonde was lodged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) entered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) room trembling, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) heart palpitating, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) voice sobbing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) wished to open the curtains of the bed, and asked for a light. '' Take care what you do,'' said the servant-maid; <div class="bookquote">``the light hurts her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the servant-maid</b></font>)</div>and immediately she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) drew the curtain again. '' My dear Cunegonde,'' said Candide, weeping, <div class="bookquote">``how are you? If you cannot see me, at least speak to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cannot speak,''  (<font color='red'><b>the maid</b></font>)</div>said the maid. The lady then put a plump hand out from the bed, and Candide bathed it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) tears and afterwards filled it with diamonds, leaving a bag of gold upon the easy chair. In the midst of these transports in came an officer, followed by the Abbé and a file of soldiers. '' There,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``are the two suspected foreigners,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) ordered them to be seized and carried to prison. <div class="bookquote">``Travellers are not treated thus in El Dorado,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide. <div class="bookquote">``I am more a Manichean now than ever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin. <div class="bookquote">``But pray, sir, where are you going to carry us?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide. <div class="bookquote">``To a dungeon,''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>answered the officer.
<p/>Martin, having recovered himself a little, judged that the lady who acted the part of Cunegonde was a cheat, that the Perigordian Abbé was a knave who had imposed upon the honest simplicity of Candide, and that the officer was another knave whom they might easily silence. Candide, advised by Martin and impatient to see the real Cunegonde, rather than expose himself before a court of justice, proposed to the officer to give him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) three small diamonds, each worth about three thousand pistoles. '' Ah, sir,'' said the man with the ivory baton, <div class="bookquote">``had you committed all the imaginable crimes you would be to me the most honest man in the world. Three diamonds! Each worth three thousand pistoles! Sir, instead of carrying you to jail I would lose my life to serve you. There are orders for arresting all foreigners, but leave it to me. I have a brother at Dieppe in Normandy! I'll conduct you thither, and if you have a diamond to give him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'ll take as much care of you as I would.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``should all foreigners be arrested?''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Perigordian Abbé</b></font>)</div>the Perigordian Abbé then made answer, <div class="bookquote">``because a poor beggar of the country of Atrébatie-LSB-28-RSB- heard some foolish things said. This induced him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) to commit a parricide, not such as that of 1610 in the month of May,-LSB-29-RSB- but such as that of 1594 in the month of December,-LSB-30-RSB- and such as others which have been committed in other years and other months by other poor devils who had heard nonsense spoken. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Perigordian Abbé</b></font>)</div>The officer then explained what the Abbé meant. '' Ah, the monsters! '' cried Candide. '' What horrors among a people who dance and sing!
<p/>Is there no way of getting quickly out of this country where monkeys provoke tigers? I have seen no bears in my country, but men I have beheld nowhere except in El Dorado. In the name of God, sir, conduct me to Venice, where I am to await Miss Cunegonde.'' <div class="bookquote">``I can conduct you no further than lower Normandy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>said the officer. Immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) ordered his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) irons to be struck off, acknowledged himself mistaken, sent away his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) men, set out with Candide and Martin for Dieppe, and left them in the care of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) brother. There was then a small Dutch ship in the harbour. The Norman, who by the virtue of three more diamonds had become the most subservient of men, put Candide and his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) attendants on board a vessel that was just ready to set sail for Portsmouth in England. This was not the way to Venice, but Candide thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) way out of hell, and reckoned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) would soon have an opportunity for resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) journey. XXIII CANDIDE AND MARTIN TOUCHED UPON THE COAST OF ENGLAND, AND WHAT THEY SAW THERE. '' Ah, Pangloss! Pangloss! Ah, Martin! Martin! Ah, my dear Cunegonde, what sort of a world is this?'' said Candide on board the Dutch ship. '' Something very foolish and abominable,'' said Martin. <div class="bookquote">``You know England? Are they as foolish there as in France?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is another kind of folly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin. <div class="bookquote">``You know that these two nations are at war for a few acres of snow in Canada,-LSB-31-RSB- and that they spend over this beautiful war much more than Canada is worth. To tell you exactly, whether there are more people fit to send to a madhouse in one country than the other, is what my imperfect intelligence will not permit.
<p/>I only know in general that the people we are going to see are very atrabilious. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Talking thus they arrived at Portsmouth. The coast was lined with crowds of people, whose eyes were fixed on a fine man kneeling, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes bandaged, on board one of the men of war in the harbour. Four soldiers stood opposite to this man; each of them fired three balls at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, with all the calmness in the world; and the whole assembly went away very well satisfied. <div class="bookquote">``What is all this?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said Candide; <div class="bookquote">``and what demon is it that exercises his (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) empire in this country? ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) then asked who was that fine man who had been killed with so much ceremony. They answered, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was an Admiral.-LSB-32-RSB- '' And why kill this Admiral?'' <div class="bookquote">``It is because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not kill a sufficient number of men himself.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Candide, <div class="bookquote">``the French Admiral was as far from the English Admiral.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There is no doubt of it; but in this country it is found good, from time to time, to kill one Admiral to encourage the others. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Candide was so shocked and bewildered by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) saw and heard, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) would not set foot on shore, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) made a bargain with the Dutch skipper -LRB-were he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) even to rob him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) like the Surinam captain-RRB- to conduct him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) without delay to Venice. The skipper was ready in two days. They coasted France; they passed in sight of Lisbon, and Candide trembled. They passed through the Straits, and entered the Mediterranean. At last they landed at Venice. <div class="bookquote">``God be praised!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Candide, embracing Martin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is here that I shall see again my beautiful Cunegonde. I trust Cacambo as myself. All is well, all will be well, all goes as well as possible. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Paquette/PAQUETTE</b></font>)</div>XXIV OF PAQUETTE AND FRIAR GIROFLÉE. Upon their arrival at Venice, Candide went to search for Cacambo at every inn and coffee-house, and among all the ladies of pleasure, but to no purpose. He (<font color='blue'><b>PAQUETTE</b></font>) sent every day to inquire on all the ships that came in. But there was no news of Cacambo. <div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>PAQUETTE</b></font>) to Martin, <div class="bookquote">``I have had time to voyage from Surinam to Bordeaux, to go from Bordeaux to Paris, from Paris to Dieppe, from Dieppe to Portsmouth, to coast along Portugal and Spain, to cross the whole Mediterranean, to spend some months, and yet the beautiful Cunegonde has not arrived! Instead of her (<font color='blue'><b>PAQUETTE</b></font>) I have only met a Parisian wench and a Perigordian Abbé. Cunegonde is dead without doubt, and there is nothing for me but to die. Alas! how much better it would have been for me to have remained in the paradise of El Dorado than to come back to this cursed Europe! You are in the right, my dear Martin: all is misery and illusion.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) fell into a deep melancholy, and neither went to see the opera, nor any of the other diversions of the Carnival; nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was proof against the temptations of all the ladies. <div class="bookquote">``You are in truth very simple,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin to him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if you imagine that a mongrel valet, who has five or six millions in his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) pocket, will go to the other end of the world to seek your mistress and bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) to you to Venice.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) find her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) will keep her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) to himself; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) do not find her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) will get another. I advise you to forget your valet Cacambo and your mistress Cunegonde. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Martin was not consoling. Candide's melancholy increased; and Martin continued to prove to him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) that there was very little virtue or happiness upon earth, except perhaps in El Dorado, where nobody could gain admittance. While they were disputing on this important subject and waiting for Cunegonde, Candide saw a young Theatin friar in St. Mark's Piazza, holding a girl on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) arm. The Theatin looked fresh coloured, plump, and vigorous; his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) eyes were sparkling, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) air assured, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) look lofty, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) step bold. The girl was very pretty, and sang; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked amorously at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) Theatin, and from time to time pinched his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) fat cheeks. <div class="bookquote">``At least you will allow me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div>said Candide to Martin, <div class="bookquote">``that these two are happy. Hitherto I have met with none but unfortunate people in the whole habitable globe, except in El Dorado; but as to this pair, I would venture to lay a wager that they are very happy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I lay you they are not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin. <div class="bookquote">``We need only ask them to dine with us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``and you will see whether I am mistaken.''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div>Immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) accosted them, presented his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) compliments, and invited them to his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) inn to eat some macaroni, with Lombard partridges, and caviare, and to drink some Montepulciano, Lachrymæ Christi, Cyprus and Samos wine. The girl blushed, the Theatin accepted the invitation and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lombard</b></font>), casting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes on Candide with confusion and surprise, and dropping a few tears. No sooner had she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) set foot in Candide's apartment than she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cried out: <div class="bookquote">``Ah! Mr. Candide does not know Paquette again.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Candide had not viewed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as yet with attention, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paquette</b></font>) thoughts being entirely taken up with Cunegonde; but recollecting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) spoke. '' Alas!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paquette</b></font>), '' my poor child, it is you who reduced Doctor Pangloss to the beautiful condition in which I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``Alas! it was I, sir, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paquette/PAQUETTE</b></font>)</div>answered Paquette. <div class="bookquote">``I see that you have heard all. I have been informed of the frightful disasters that befell the family of my lady Baroness, and the fair Cunegonde. I swear to you that my fate has been scarcely less sad. I was very innocent when you knew me. A Grey Friar, who was my confessor, easily seduced me. The consequences were terrible. I was obliged to quit the castle some time after the Baron had sent you away with kicks on the backside. If a famous surgeon had not taken compassion on me, I should have died. For some time I was this surgeon's mistress, merely out of gratitude. His (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) wife, who was mad with jealousy, beat me every day unmercifully; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a fury. The surgeon was one of the ugliest of men, and I the most wretched of women, to be continually beaten for a man I did not love. You know, sir, what a dangerous thing it is for an ill-natured woman to be married to a doctor. Incensed at the behaviour of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) one day gave her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) so effectual a remedy to cure her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) of a slight cold, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) died two hours after, in most horrid convulsions. The wife's relations prosecuted the husband; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) took flight, and I was thrown into jail. My innocence would not have saved me if I had not been good-looking. The judge set me free, on condition that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) succeeded the surgeon.
<p/>I was soon supplanted by a rival, turned out of doors quite destitute, and obliged to continue this abominable trade, which appears so pleasant to you men, while to us women it is the utmost abyss of misery. I have come to exercise the profession at Venice. Ah! sir, if you could only imagine what it is to be obliged to caress indifferently an old merchant, a lawyer, a monk, a gondolier, an abbé, to be exposed to abuse and insults; to be often reduced to borrowing a petticoat, only to go and have it raised by a disagreeable man; to be robbed by one of what one has earned from another; to be subject to the extortions of the officers of justice; and to have in prospect only a frightful old age, a hospital, and a dung-hill; you would conclude that I am one of the most unhappy creatures in the world.'' (<font color='red'><b>Paquette/PAQUETTE</b></font>)</div>-LSB-33-RSB- Paquette thus opened her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart to honest Candide, in the presence of Martin, who said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) friend: '' You see that already I have won half the wager.'' Friar Giroflée stayed in the dining-room, and drank a glass or two of wine while he (<font color='blue'><b>Giroflée</b></font>) was waiting for dinner. '' But,'' said Candide to Paquette, <div class="bookquote">``you looked so gay and content when I met you; you sang and you behaved so lovingly to the Theatin, that you seemed to me as happy as you pretend to be now the reverse.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paquette/PAQUETTE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah! sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paquette/PAQUETTE</b></font>)</div>answered Paquette, <div class="bookquote">``this is one of the miseries of the trade. Yesterday I was robbed and beaten by an officer; yet to-day I must put on good humour to please a friar.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paquette/PAQUETTE</b></font>)</div>Candide wanted no more convincing; he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) owned that Martin was in the right.
<p/>They sat down to table with Paquette and the Theatin; the repast was entertaining; and towards the end they conversed with all confidence. '' Father,'' said Candide to the Friar, <div class="bookquote">``you appear to me to enjoy a state that all the world might envy; the flower of health shines in your face , your expression makes plain your happiness; you have a very pretty girl for your recreation, and you seem well satisfied with your state as a Theatin.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Friar</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My faith, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Giroflée/Friar Giroflée/FRIAR GIROFLÉE</b></font>)</div>said Friar Giroflée, <div class="bookquote">``I wish that all the Theatins were at the bottom of the sea. I have been tempted a hundred times to set fire to the convent, and go and become a Turk. My parents forced me at the age of fifteen to put on this detestable habit, to increase the fortune of a cursed elder brother, whom God confound. Jealousy, discord, and fury, dwell in the convent. It is true I have preached a few bad sermons that have brought me in a little money, of which the prior stole half, while the rest serves to maintain my girls; but when I return at night to the monastery, I am ready to dash my head against the walls of the dormitory; and all my fellows are in the same case.''  (<font color='red'><b>Giroflée/Friar Giroflée/FRIAR GIROFLÉE</b></font>)</div>Martin turned towards Candide with his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) usual coolness. '' Well,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``have I not won the whole wager? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Candide gave two thousand piastres to Paquette, and one thousand to Friar Giroflée. <div class="bookquote">``I'll answer for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Friar</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that with this they will be happy.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do not believe it at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin; <div class="bookquote">``you will, perhaps, with these piastres only render them the more unhappy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let that be as it may,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``but one thing consoles me.
<p/>I see that we often meet with those whom we expected never to see more; so that, perhaps, as I have found my red sheep and Paquette, it may well be that I shall also find Cunegonde.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) may one day make you very happy; but I doubt it very much.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are very hard of belief,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide. <div class="bookquote">``I have lived,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin. <div class="bookquote">``You see those gondoliers,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``are they not perpetually singing?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You do not see them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin, <div class="bookquote">``at home with their wives and brats. The Doge has his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) troubles, the gondoliers have theirs. It is true that, all things considered, the life of a gondolier is preferable to that of a Doge; but I believe the difference to be so trifling that it is not worth the trouble of examining.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``People talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``of the Senator Pococurante, who lives in that fine palace on the Brenta, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Pococurante</b></font>) entertains foreigners in the politest manner. They pretend that this man has never felt any uneasiness.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I should be glad to see such a rarity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin. Candide immediately sent to ask the Lord Pococurante permission to wait upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) the next day. XXV THE VISIT TO LORD POCOCURANTE, A NOBLE VENETIAN. Candide and Martin went in a gondola on the Brenta, and arrived at the palace of the noble Signor Pococurante. The gardens, laid out with taste, were adorned with fine marble statues. The palace was beautifully built. The master of the house was a man of sixty, and very rich. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) received the two travellers with polite indifference, which put Candide a little out of countenance, but was not at all disagreeable to Martin. First, two pretty girls, very neatly dressed, served them with chocolate, which was frothed exceedingly well.
<p/>Candide could not refrain from commending their beauty, grace, and address. <div class="bookquote">``They are good enough creatures,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Senator</b></font>)</div>said the Senator. <div class="bookquote">``I make them lie with me sometimes, for I am very tired of the ladies of the town, of their coquetries, of their jealousies, of their quarrels, of their humours, of their pettinesses, of their prides, of their follies, and of the sonnets which one must make, or have made, for them. But after all, these two girls begin to weary me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>After breakfast, Candide walking into a long gallery was surprised by the beautiful pictures. He (<font color='blue'><b>Senator</b></font>) asked, by what master were the two first. <div class="bookquote">``They are by Raphael,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Senator</b></font>)</div>said the Senator. <div class="bookquote">``I bought them at a great price, out of vanity, some years ago. They are said to be the finest things in Italy, but they do not please me at all. The colours are too dark, the figures are not sufficiently rounded, nor in good relief; the draperies in no way resemble stuffs. In a word, whatever may be said, I do not find there a true imitation of nature. I only care for a picture when I think I see nature itself; and there are none of this sort. I have a great many pictures, but I prize them very little.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>While they were waiting for dinner Pococurante ordered a concert. Candide found the music delicious. '' This noise,'' said the Senator, <div class="bookquote">``may amuse one for half an hour; but if it were to last longer it would grow tiresome to everybody, though they durst not own it. Music, to-day, is only the art of executing difficult things, and that which is only difficult cannot please long.
<p/>Perhaps I should be fonder of the opera if they had not found the secret of making of it a monster which shocks me. Let who will go to see bad tragedies set to music, where the scenes are contrived for no other end than to introduce two or three songs ridiculously out of place, to show off an actress's voice. Let who will, or who can, die away with pleasure at the sight of an eunuch quavering the rôle of Cæsar, or of Cato, and strutting awkwardly upon the stage. For my part I have long since renounced those paltry entertainments which constitute the glory of modern Italy, and are purchased so dearly by sovereigns. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Senator</b></font>)</div>Candide disputed the point a little, but with discretion. Martin was entirely of the Senator's opinion. They sat down to table, and after an excellent dinner they went into the library. Candide, seeing a Homer magnificently bound, commended the virtuoso on his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) good taste. '' There,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``is a book that was once the delight of the great Pangloss, the best philosopher in Germany.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is not mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pococurante/Lord Pococurante</b></font>)</div>answered Pococurante coolly. <div class="bookquote">``They used at one time to make me believe that I took a pleasure in reading him (<font color='blue'><b>Pococurante</b></font>). But that continual repetition of battles, so extremely like one another; those gods that are always active without doing anything decisive; that Helen who is the cause of the war, and who yet scarcely appears in the piece; that Troy, so long besieged without being taken; all these together caused me great weariness. I have sometimes asked learned men whether they were not as weary as I of that work.
<p/>Those who were sincere have owned to me that the poem made them fall asleep; yet it was necessary to have it in their library as a monument of antiquity, or like those rusty medals which are no longer of use in commerce.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But your Excellency does not think thus of Virgil?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide. <div class="bookquote">``I grant,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Senator</b></font>)</div>said the Senator, <div class="bookquote">``that the second, fourth, and sixth books of his (<font color='blue'><b>Senator</b></font>) Æneid are excellent, but as for his (<font color='blue'><b>Senator</b></font>) pious Æneas, his (<font color='blue'><b>Senator</b></font>) strong Cloanthus, his (<font color='blue'><b>Senator</b></font>) friend Achates, his (<font color='blue'><b>Senator</b></font>) little Ascanius, his (<font color='blue'><b>Senator</b></font>) silly King Latinus, his (<font color='blue'><b>Senator</b></font>) bourgeois Amata, his (<font color='blue'><b>Senator</b></font>) insipid Lavinia, I think there can be nothing more flat and disagreeable. I prefer Tasso a good deal, or even the soporific tales of Ariosto.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Senator</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``May I presume to ask you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``whether you do not receive a great deal of pleasure from reading Horace?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There are maxims in this writer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pococurante/Lord Pococurante</b></font>)</div>answered Pococurante, <div class="bookquote">``from which a man of the world may reap great benefit, and being written in energetic verse they are more easily impressed upon the memory. But I care little for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) journey to Brundusium, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) account of a bad dinner, or of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) low quarrel between one Rupilius whose words he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says were full of poisonous filth, and another whose language was imbued with vinegar. I have read with much distaste his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) indelicate verses against old women and witches; nor do I see any merit in telling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend Mæcenas that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will but rank him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the choir of lyric poets, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lofty head shall touch the stars. Fools admire everything in an author of reputation. For my part, I read only to please myself. I like only that which serves my purpose.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pococurante/Lord Pococurante</b></font>)</div><p/>Candide, having been educated never to judge for himself, was much surprised at what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard. Martin found there was a good deal of reason in Pococurante's remarks. '' Oh! here is Cicero,'' said Candide. <div class="bookquote">``Here is the great man whom I fancy you are never tired of reading.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I never read him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the Venetian. <div class="bookquote">``What is it to me whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleads for Rabirius or Cluentius? I try causes enough myself; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) philosophical works seem to me better, but when I found that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doubted of everything, I concluded that I knew as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and that I had no need of a guide to learn ignorance.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ha! here are four-score volumes of the Academy of Sciences,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>cried Martin. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps there is something valuable in this collection.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There might be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pococurante/Lord Pococurante</b></font>)</div>said Pococurante, <div class="bookquote">``if only one of those rakers of rubbish had shown how to make pins; but in all these volumes there is nothing but chimerical systems, and not a single useful thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pococurante/Lord Pococurante</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And what dramatic works I see here,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``in Italian, Spanish, and French.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Senator</b></font>)</div>replied the Senator, <div class="bookquote">``there are three thousand, and not three dozen of them good for anything. As to those collections of sermons, which altogether are not worth a single page of Seneca, and those huge volumes of theology, you may well imagine that neither I nor any one else ever opens them.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Senator</b></font>)</div>Martin saw some shelves filled with English books. <div class="bookquote">``I have a notion,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that a Republican must be greatly pleased with most of these books, which are written with a spirit of freedom.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pococurante/Lord Pococurante</b></font>)</div>answered Pococurante, <div class="bookquote">``it is noble to write as one thinks; this is the privilege of humanity.
<p/>In all our Italy we write only what we do not think; those who inhabit the country of the Cæsars and the Antoninuses dare not acquire a single idea without the permission of a Dominican friar. I should be pleased with the liberty which inspires the English genius if passion and party spirit did not corrupt all that is estimable in this precious liberty.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pococurante/Lord Pococurante</b></font>)</div>Candide, observing a Milton, asked whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) did not look upon this author as a great man. '' Who?'' said Pococurante, <div class="bookquote">``that barbarian, who writes a long commentary in ten books of harsh verse on the first chapter of Genesis; that coarse imitator of the Greeks, who disfigures the Creation, and who, while Moses represents the Eternal producing the world by a word, makes the Messiah take a great pair of compasses from the armoury of heaven to circumscribe His (<font color='blue'><b>Messiah</b></font>) work? How can I have any esteem for a writer who has spoiled Tasso's hell and the devil, who transforms Lucifer sometimes into a toad and other times into a pigmy, who makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucifer</b></font>) repeat the same things a hundred times, who makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucifer</b></font>) dispute on theology, who, by a serious imitation of Ariosto's comic invention of firearms, represents the devils cannonading in heaven? Neither I nor any man in Italy could take pleasure in those melancholy extravagances; and the marriage of Sin and Death, and the snakes brought forth by Sin, are enough to turn the stomach of any one with the least taste, -LSB-and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) long description of a pest-house is good only for a grave-digger-RSB-. This obscure, whimsical, and disagreeable poem was despised upon its first publication, and I only treat it now as it was treated in its own country by contemporaries.
<p/>For the matter of that I say what I think, and I care very little whether others think as I do. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Pococurante/Lord Pococurante</b></font>)</div>Candide was grieved at this speech, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a respect for Homer and was fond of Milton. '' Alas!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) softly to Martin, <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid that this man holds our German poets in very great contempt.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There would not be much harm in that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin. '' Oh! what a superior man,'' said Candide below his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breath. <div class="bookquote">``What a great genius is this Pococurante! Nothing can please him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>After their survey of the library they went down into the garden, where Candide praised its several beauties. <div class="bookquote">``I know of nothing in so bad a taste,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master. <div class="bookquote">``All you see here is merely trifling. After to-morrow I will have it planted with a nobler design.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Candide to Martin when they had taken their leave, <div class="bookquote">``you will agree that this is the happiest of mortals, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is above everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) possesses.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But do you not see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>answered Martin, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is disgusted with all he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) possesses? Plato observed a long while ago that those stomachs are not the best that reject all sorts of food.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But is there not a pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``in criticising everything, in pointing out faults where others see nothing but beauties?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>replied Martin, <div class="bookquote">``that there is some pleasure in having no pleasure.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``I find that I shall be the only happy man when I am blessed with the sight of my dear Cunegonde.''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is always well to hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin. However, the days and the weeks passed.
<p/>Cacambo did not come, and Candide was so overwhelmed with grief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) did not even reflect that Paquette and Friar Giroflée did not return to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Giroflée</b></font>). XXVI OF A SUPPER WHICH CANDIDE AND MARTIN TOOK WITH SIX STRANGERS, AND WHO THEY WERE.-LSB-34-RSB- One evening that Candide and Martin were going to sit down to supper with some foreigners who lodged in the same inn, a man whose complexion was as black as soot, came behind Candide, and taking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the arm, said: <div class="bookquote">``Get yourself ready to go along with us; do not fail. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Upon this he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned round and saw--Cacambo! Nothing but the sight of Cunegonde could have astonished and delighted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) more. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was on the point of going mad with joy. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) embraced his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dear friend. '' Cunegonde is here, without doubt; where is she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Take me to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that I may die of joy in her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) company.'' <div class="bookquote">``Cunegonde is not here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>said Cacambo, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is at Constantinople.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, heavens! at Constantinople! But were she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in China I would fly thither; let us be off.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We shall set out after supper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>replied Cacambo. <div class="bookquote">``I can tell you nothing more; I am a slave, my master awaits me, I must serve him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) at table; speak not a word, eat, and then get ready. ''  (<font color='red'><b>faithful</b></font>)</div>Candide, distracted between joy and grief, delighted at seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) faithful agent again, astonished at finding him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) a slave, filled with the fresh hope of recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) mistress, his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) heart palpitating, his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) understanding confused, sat down to table with Martin, who saw all these scenes quite unconcerned, and with six strangers who had come to spend the Carnival at Venice.
<p/>Cacambo waited at table upon one of the strangers; towards the end of the entertainment he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) drew near his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) master, and whispered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) ear: <div class="bookquote">``Sire, your Majesty may start when you please, the vessel is ready. ''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>On saying these words he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) went out. The company in great surprise looked at one another without speaking a word, when another domestic approached his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) master and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Sire, your Majesty's chaise is at Padua, and the boat is ready. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The master gave a nod and the servant went away. The company all stared at one another again, and their surprise redoubled. A third valet came up to a third stranger, saying: <div class="bookquote">``Sire, believe me, your Majesty ought not to stay here any longer. I am going to get everything ready.''  (<font color='red'><b>a stranger</b></font>)</div>And immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) disappeared. Candide and Martin did not doubt that this was a masquerade of the Carnival. Then a fourth domestic said to a fourth master: <div class="bookquote">``Your Majesty may depart when you please.''  (<font color='red'><b>a master</b></font>)</div>Saying this he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) went away like the rest. The fifth valet said the same thing to the fifth master. But the sixth valet spoke differently to the sixth stranger, who sat near Candide. He (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Faith, Sire, they will no longer give credit to your Majesty nor to me, and we may perhaps both of us be put in jail this very night. Therefore I will take care of myself. Adieu. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The servants being all gone, the six strangers, with Candide and Martin, remained in a profound silence. At length Candide broke it. '' Gentlemen,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``this is a very good joke indeed, but why should you all be kings? For me I own that neither Martin nor I is a king.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Cacambo's master then gravely answered in Italian: <div class="bookquote">``I am not at all joking. My name is Achmet III. I was Grand Sultan many years. I dethroned my brother; my nephew dethroned me, my viziers were beheaded, and I am condemned to end my days in the old Seraglio. My nephew, the great Sultan Mahmoud, permits me to travel sometimes for my health, and I am come to spend the Carnival at Venice.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo master</b></font>)</div>A young man who sat next to Achmet, spoke then as follows: <div class="bookquote">``My name is Ivan. I was once Emperor of all the Russias, but was dethroned in my cradle. My parents were confined in prison and I was educated there; yet I am sometimes allowed to travel in company with persons who act as guards; and I am come to spend the Carnival at Venice. ''  (<font color='red'><b>A man</b></font>)</div>The third said: <div class="bookquote">``I am Charles Edward, King of England; my father has resigned all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) legal rights to me. I have fought in defence of them; and above eight hundred of my adherents have been hanged, drawn, and quartered. I have been confined in prison; I am going to Rome, to pay a visit to the King, my father, who was dethroned as well as myself and my grandfather, and I am come to spend the Carnival at Venice. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The fourth spoke thus in his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) turn: <div class="bookquote">``I am the King of Poland; the fortune of war has stripped me of my hereditary dominions; my father underwent the same vicissitudes; I resign myself to Providence in the same manner as Sultan Achmet, the Emperor Ivan, and King Charles Edward, whom God long preserve; and I am come to the Carnival at Venice. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The fifth said: <div class="bookquote">``I am King of Poland also; I have been twice dethroned; but Providence has given me another country, where I have done more good than all the Sarmatian kings were ever capable of doing on the banks of the Vistula; I resign myself likewise to Providence, and am come to pass the Carnival at Venice. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the monarch</b></font>)</div>It was now the sixth monarch's turn to speak: <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>the monarch</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I am not so great a prince as any of you; however, I am a king. I am Theodore, elected King of Corsica; I had the title of Majesty, and now I am scarcely treated as a gentleman. I have coined money, and now am not worth a farthing; I have had two secretaries of state, and now I have scarce a valet; I have seen myself on a throne, and I have seen myself upon straw in a common jail in London. I am afraid that I shall meet with the same treatment here though, like your majesties, I am come to see the Carnival at Venice. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The other five kings listened to this speech with generous compassion. Each of them gave twenty sequins to King Theodore to buy him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) clothes and linen; and Candide made him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) a present of a diamond worth two thousand sequins. <div class="bookquote">``Who can this private person be,''  (<font color='red'><b>the kings</b></font>)</div>said the five kings to one another, <div class="bookquote">``who is able to give, and really has given, a hundred times as much as any of us?''  (<font color='red'><b>the kings</b></font>)</div>Just as they rose from table, in came four Serene Highnesses, who had also been stripped of their territories by the fortune of war, and were come to spend the Carnival at Venice.
<p/>But Candide paid no regard to these newcomers, his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) thoughts were entirely employed on his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) voyage to Constantinople, in search of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) beloved Cunegonde. XXVII CANDIDE'S VOYAGE TO CONSTANTINOPLE. The faithful Cacambo had already prevailed upon the Turkish skipper, who was to conduct the Sultan Achmet to Constantinople, to receive Candide and Martin on his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) ship. They both embarked after having made their obeisance to his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) miserable Highness. <div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Candide to Martin on the way, <div class="bookquote">``we supped with six dethroned kings, and of those six there was one to whom I gave charity. Perhaps there are many other princes yet more unfortunate. For my part, I have only lost a hundred sheep; and now I am flying into Cunegonde's arms. My dear Martin, yet once more Pangloss was right: all is for the best.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wish it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>answered Martin. '' But,'' said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``it was a very strange adventure we met with at Venice. It has never before been seen or heard that six dethroned kings have supped together at a public inn.''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is not more extraordinary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin, <div class="bookquote">``than most of the things that have happened to us. It is a very common thing for kings to be dethroned; and as for the honour we have had of supping in their company, it is a trifle not worth our attention. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>No sooner had Candide got on board the vessel than he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) flew to his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) old valet and friend Cacambo, and tenderly embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). '' Well,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``what news of Cunegonde? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) still a prodigy of beauty? Does she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) love me still? How is she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)? Thou hast doubtless bought her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) a palace at Constantinople?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear master,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>answered Cacambo, <div class="bookquote">``Cunegonde washes dishes on the banks of the Propontis, in the service of a prince, who has very few dishes to wash; she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is a slave in the family of an ancient sovereign named Ragotsky,-LSB-35-RSB- to whom the Grand Turk allows three crowns a day in his (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) exile. But what is worse still is, that she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) has lost her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) beauty and has become horribly ugly.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, handsome or ugly,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Candide, <div class="bookquote">``I am a man of honour, and it is my duty to love her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) still. But how came she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) to be reduced to so abject a state with the five or six millions that you took to her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>said Cacambo, <div class="bookquote">``was I not to give two millions to Senor Don Fernando d'Ibaraa, y Figueora, y Mascarenes, y Lampourdos, y Souza, Governor of Buenos Ayres, for permitting Miss Cunegonde to come away? And did not a corsair bravely rob us of all the rest? Did not this corsair carry us to Cape Matapan, to Milo, to Nicaria, to Samos, to Petra, to the Dardanelles, to Marmora, to Scutari? Cunegonde and the old woman serve the prince I now mentioned to you, and I am slave to the dethroned Sultan.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What a series of shocking calamities!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Candide. '' But after all, I have some diamonds left; and I may easily pay Cunegonde's ransom. Yet it is a pity that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is grown so ugly.'' Then, turning towards Martin: <div class="bookquote">``Who do you think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``is most to be pitied-- the Sultan Achmet, the Emperor Ivan, King Charles Edward, or I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How should I know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>answered Martin. <div class="bookquote">``I must see into your hearts to be able to tell.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``if Pangloss were here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) could tell.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin, <div class="bookquote">``in what sort of scales your Pangloss would weigh the misfortunes of mankind and set a just estimate on their sorrows. All that I can presume to say is, that there are millions of people upon earth who have a hundred times more to complain of than King Charles Edward, the Emperor Ivan, or the Sultan Achmet.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That may well be,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide. In a few days they reached the Bosphorus, and Candide began by paying a very high ransom for Cacambo. Then without losing time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sultan</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sultan</b></font>) companions went on board a galley, in order to search on the banks of the Propontis for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sultan</b></font>) Cunegonde, however ugly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sultan</b></font>) might have become. Among the crew there were two slaves who rowed very badly, and to whose bare shoulders the Levantine captain would now and then apply blows from a bull's pizzle. Candide, from a natural impulse, looked at these two slaves more attentively than at the other oarsmen, and approached them with pity. Their features though greatly disfigured, had a slight resemblance to those of Pangloss and the unhappy Jesuit and Westphalian Baron, brother to Miss Cunegonde. This moved and saddened him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) looked at them still more attentively. '' Indeed,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) to Cacambo, <div class="bookquote">``if I had not seen Master Pangloss hanged, and if I had not had the misfortune to kill the Baron, I should think it was they that were rowing. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>At the names of the Baron and of Pangloss, the two galley-slaves uttered a loud cry, held fast by the seat, and let drop their oars. The captain ran up to them and redoubled his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) blows with the bull's pizzle. <div class="bookquote">``Stop! stop! sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Candide. <div class="bookquote">``I will give you what money you please.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What! it is Candide!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the slaves</b></font>)</div><p/>said one of the slaves. '' What! it is Candide!'' said the other. '' Do I dream?'' cried Candide; <div class="bookquote">``am I awake? or am I on board a galley? Is this the Baron whom I killed? Is this Master Pangloss whom I saw hanged?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is we! it is we!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered they. '' Well! is this the great philosopher?'' said Martin. '' Ah! captain,'' said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``what ransom will you take for Monsieur de Thunder-ten-Tronckh, one of the first barons of the empire, and for Monsieur Pangloss, the profoundest metaphysician in Germany?''  (<font color='red'><b>captain</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dog of a Christian,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Levantine captain</b></font>)</div>answered the Levantine captain, <div class="bookquote">``since these two dogs of Christian slaves are barons and metaphysicians, which I doubt not are high dignities in their country, you shall give me fifty thousand sequins.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Levantine captain</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You shall have them, sir. Carry me back at once to Constantinople, and you shall receive the money directly. But no; carry me first to Miss Cunegonde.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Levantine captain</b></font>)</div>Upon the first proposal made by Candide, however, the Levantine captain had already tacked about, and made the crew ply their oars quicker than a bird cleaves the air. Candide embraced the Baron and Pangloss a hundred times. '' And how happened it, my dear Baron, that I did not kill you? And, my dear Pangloss, how came you to life again after being hanged? And why are you both in a Turkish galley?'' <div class="bookquote">``And it is true that my dear sister is in this country?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baron</b></font>)</div>said the Baron. '' Yes,'' answered Cacambo. '' Then I behold, once more, my dear Candide,'' cried Pangloss. Candide presented Martin and Cacambo to them; they embraced each other, and all spoke at once. The galley flew; they were already in the port.
<p/>Instantly Candide sent for a Jew, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) sold for fifty thousand sequins a diamond worth a hundred thousand, though the fellow swore to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) by Abraham that he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) could give him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) no more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) immediately paid the ransom for the Baron and Pangloss. The latter threw himself at the feet of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) deliverer, and bathed them with his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) tears; the former thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) with a nod, and promised to return him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) the money on the first opportunity. '' But is it indeed possible that my sister can be in Turkey?'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Nothing is more possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>said Cacambo, <div class="bookquote">``since she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) scours the dishes in the service of a Transylvanian prince. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cacambo</b></font>)</div>Candide sent directly for two Jews and sold them some more diamonds, and then they all set out together in another galley to deliver Cunegonde from slavery. XXVIII WHAT HAPPENED TO CANDIDE, CUNEGONDE, PANGLOSS, MARTIN, ETC. <div class="bookquote">``I ask your pardon once more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Candide to the Baron, <div class="bookquote">``your pardon, reverend father, for having run you through the body.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baron</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Say no more about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baron</b></font>)</div>answered the Baron. <div class="bookquote">``I was a little too hasty, I own, but since you wish to know by what fatality I came to be a galley-slave I will inform you. After I had been cured by the surgeon of the college of the wound you gave me, I was attacked and carried off by a party of Spanish troops, who confined me in prison at Buenos Ayres at the very time my sister was setting out thence. I asked leave to return to Rome to the General of my Order. I was appointed chaplain to the French Ambassador at Constantinople. I had not been eight days in this employment when one evening I met with a young Ichoglan, who was a very handsome fellow.
<p/>The weather was warm. The young man wanted to bathe, and I took this opportunity of bathing also. I did not know that it was a capital crime for a Christian to be found naked with a young Mussulman. A cadi ordered me a hundred blows on the soles of the feet, and condemned me to the galleys. I do not think there ever was a greater act of injustice. But I should be glad to know how my sister came to be scullion to a Transylvanian prince who has taken shelter among the Turks.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you, my dear Pangloss,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``how can it be that I behold you again?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>said Pangloss, <div class="bookquote">``that you saw me hanged. I should have been burnt, but you may remember it rained exceedingly hard when they were going to roast me; the storm was so violent that they despaired of lighting the fire, so I was hanged because they could do no better. A surgeon purchased my body, carried me home, and dissected me. He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) back, and imagining that he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) had been dissecting the devil he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) ran away, dying with fear, and fell down the staircase in his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) flight. His (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) wife, hearing the noise, flew from the next room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) saw me stretched out upon the table with my crucial incision. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was seized with yet greater fear than her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, fled, and tumbled over him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). When they came to themselves a little, I heard the wife say to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband: `My dear, how could you take it into your head to dissect a heretic? Do you not know that these people always have the devil in their bodies? I will go and fetch a priest this minute to exorcise him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>).' At this proposal I shuddered, and mustering up what little courage I had still remaining I cried out aloud, `Have mercy on me!' At length the Portuguese barber plucked up his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) spirits. He (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) sewed up my wounds; his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days. The barber found me a place as lackey to a knight of Malta who was going to Venice, but finding that my master had no money to pay me my wages I entered the service of a Venetian merchant, and went with him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) to Constantinople. One day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her (<font color='blue'><b>Iman</b></font>) paternosters. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Iman</b></font>) bosom was uncovered, and between her (<font color='blue'><b>Iman</b></font>) breasts she (<font color='blue'><b>Iman</b></font>) had a beautiful bouquet of tulips, roses, anemones, ranunculus, hyacinths, and auriculas. She (<font color='blue'><b>Iman</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Iman</b></font>) bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Iman</b></font>) with a profound reverence. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he (<font color='blue'><b>Iman</b></font>) called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys.
<p/>I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) had suffered greater injustice than I, and I insisted that it was far more innocent to take up a bouquet and place it again on a woman's bosom than to be found stark naked with an Ichoglan. We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear Pangloss,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Candide to him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am still of my first opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>answered Pangloss, <div class="bookquote">``for I am a philosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) plenum and materia subtilis .''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>XXIX HOW CANDIDE FOUND CUNEGONDE AND THE OLD WOMAN AGAIN. While Candide, the Baron, Pangloss, Martin, and Cacambo were relating their several adventures, were reasoning on the contingent or non-contingent events of the universe, disputing on effects and causes, on moral and physical evil, on liberty and necessity, and on the consolations a slave may feel even on a Turkish galley, they arrived at the house of the Transylvanian prince on the banks of the Propontis. The first objects which met their sight were Cunegonde and the old woman hanging towels out to dry. The Baron paled at this sight.
<p/>The tender, loving Candide, seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) beautiful Cunegonde embrowned, with blood-shot eyes, withered neck, wrinkled cheeks, and rough, red arms, recoiled three paces, seized with horror, and then advanced out of good manners. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) embraced Candide and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother; they embraced the old woman, and Candide ransomed them both. There was a small farm in the neighbourhood which the old woman proposed to Candide to make a shift with till the company could be provided for in a better manner. Cunegonde did not know she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had grown ugly, for nobody had told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) of it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reminded Candide of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) promise in so positive a tone that the good man durst not refuse her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) therefore intimated to the Baron that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) intended marrying his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) sister. <div class="bookquote">``I will not suffer,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baron meanness insolence</b></font>)</div>said the Baron, <div class="bookquote">``such meanness on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) part, and such insolence on yours; I will never be reproached with this scandalous thing; my sister's children would never be able to enter the church in Germany. No; my sister shall only marry a baron of the empire. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baron meanness insolence</b></font>)</div>Cunegonde flung herself at his (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>) feet, and bathed them with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) tears; still he (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>) was inflexible. '' Thou foolish fellow,'' said Candide; <div class="bookquote">``I have delivered thee out of the galleys, I have paid thy ransom, and thy sister's also; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was a scullion, and is very ugly, yet I am so condescending as to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); and dost thou pretend to oppose the match? I should kill thee again, were I only to consult my anger.''  (<font color='red'><b>Candide</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thou mayest kill me again,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baron</b></font>)</div>said the Baron, <div class="bookquote">``but thou shalt not marry my sister, at least whilst I am living.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baron</b></font>)</div>XXX THE CONCLUSION. At the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) heart Candide had no wish to marry Cunegonde.
<p/>But the extreme impertinence of the Baron determined him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) to conclude the match, and Cunegonde pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) so strongly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) could not go from his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) word. He (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) consulted Pangloss, Martin, and the faithful Cacambo. Pangloss drew up an excellent memorial, wherein he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) proved that the Baron had no right over his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) sister, and that according to all the laws of the empire, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) might marry Candide with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) left hand. Martin was for throwing the Baron into the sea; Cacambo decided that it would be better to deliver him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) up again to the captain of the galley, after which they thought to send him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) back to the General Father of the Order at Rome by the first ship. This advice was well received, the old woman approved it; they said not a word to his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) sister; the thing was executed for a little money, and they had the double pleasure of entrapping a Jesuit, and punishing the pride of a German baron. It is natural to imagine that after so many disasters Candide married, and living with the philosopher Pangloss, the philosopher Martin, the prudent Cacambo, and the old woman, having besides brought so many diamonds from the country of the ancient Incas, must have led a very happy life. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was so much imposed upon by the Jews that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had nothing left except his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) small farm; his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) wife became uglier every day, more peevish and unsupportable; the old woman was infirm and even more fretful than Cunegonde. Cacambo, who worked in the garden, and took vegetables for sale to Constantinople, was fatigued with hard work, and cursed his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) destiny. Pangloss was in despair at not shining in some German university.
<p/>For Martin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was firmly persuaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) would be as badly off elsewhere, and therefore bore things patiently. Candide, Martin, and Pangloss sometimes disputed about morals and metaphysics. They often saw passing under the windows of their farm boats full of Effendis, Pashas, and Cadis, who were going into banishment to Lemnos, Mitylene, or Erzeroum. And they saw other Cadis, Pashas, and Effendis coming to supply the place of the exiles, and afterwards exiled in their turn. They saw heads decently impaled for presentation to the Sublime Porte. Such spectacles as these increased the number of their dissertations; and when they did not dispute time hung so heavily upon their hands, that one day the old woman ventured to say to them: <div class="bookquote">``I want to know which is worse, to be ravished a hundred times by negro pirates, to have a buttock cut off, to run the gauntlet among the Bulgarians, to be whipped and hanged at an auto-da-fé , to be dissected, to row in the galleys--in short, to go through all the miseries we have undergone, or to stay here and have nothing to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is a great question,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide. This discourse gave rise to new reflections, and Martin especially concluded that man was born to live either in a state of distracting inquietude or of lethargic disgust. Candide did not quite agree to that, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) affirmed nothing. Pangloss owned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had always suffered horribly, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had once asserted that everything went wonderfully well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) asserted it still, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) no longer believed it. What helped to confirm Martin in his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) detestable principles, to stagger Candide more than ever, and to puzzle Pangloss, was that one day they saw Paquette and Friar Giroflée land at the farm in extreme misery.
<p/>They had soon squandered their three thousand piastres, parted, were reconciled, quarrelled again, were thrown into gaol, had escaped, and Friar Giroflée had at length become Turk. Paquette continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) trade wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) went, but made nothing of it. <div class="bookquote">``I foresaw,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin to Candide, <div class="bookquote">``that your presents would soon be dissipated, and only make them the more miserable. You have rolled in millions of money, you and Cacambo; and yet you are not happier than Friar Giroflée and Paquette.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>said Pangloss to Paquette, <div class="bookquote">``Providence has then brought you amongst us again, my poor child! Do you know that you cost me the tip of my nose, an eye, and an ear, as you may see? What a world is this!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paquette/PAQUETTE</b></font>)</div>And now this new adventure set them philosophising more than ever. In the neighbourhood there lived a very famous Dervish who was esteemed the best philosopher in all Turkey, and they went to consult him (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>). Pangloss was the speaker. '' Master,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we come to beg you to tell why so strange an animal as man was made.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``With what meddlest thou?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Dervish</b></font>)</div>said the Dervish; <div class="bookquote">``is it thy business?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Dervish</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But, reverend father,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``there is horrible evil in this world.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What signifies it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Dervish</b></font>)</div>said the Dervish, <div class="bookquote">``whether there be evil or good? When his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) highness sends a ship to Egypt, does he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) trouble his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head whether the mice on board are at their ease or not?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Dervish</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What, then, must we do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>said Pangloss. <div class="bookquote">``Hold your tongue,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Dervish</b></font>)</div>answered the Dervish. <div class="bookquote">``I was in hopes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>said Pangloss, <div class="bookquote">``that I should reason with you a little about causes and effects, about the best of possible worlds, the origin of evil, the nature of the soul, and the pre-established harmony.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>At these words, the Dervish shut the door in their faces. During this conversation, the news was spread that two Viziers and the Mufti had been strangled at Constantinople, and that several of their friends had been impaled. This catastrophe made a great noise for some hours. Pangloss, Candide, and Martin, returning to the little farm, saw a good old man taking the fresh air at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) door under an orange bower. Pangloss, who was as inquisitive as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was argumentative, asked the old man what was the name of the strangled Mufti. <div class="bookquote">``I do not know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the worthy man, <div class="bookquote">``and I have not known the name of any Mufti, nor of any Vizier. I am entirely ignorant of the event you mention; I presume in general that they who meddle with the administration of public affairs die sometimes miserably, and that they deserve it; but I never trouble my head about what is transacting at Constantinople; I content myself with sending there for sale the fruits of the garden which I cultivate.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Having said these words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mufti</b></font>) invited the strangers into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mufti</b></font>) house; his (<font color='blue'><b>Mufti</b></font>) two sons and two daughters presented them with several sorts of sherbet, which they made themselves, with Kaimak enriched with the candied-peel of citrons, with oranges, lemons, pine-apples, pistachio-nuts, and Mocha coffee unadulterated with the bad coffee of Batavia or the American islands. After which the two daughters of the honest Mussulman perfumed the strangers' beards. <div class="bookquote">``You must have a vast and magnificent estate,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Turk</b></font>)</div>said Candide to the Turk. <div class="bookquote">``I have only twenty acres,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the old man; <div class="bookquote">``I and my children cultivate them; our labour preserves us from three great evils--weariness, vice, and want. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Candide, on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way home, made profound reflections on the old man's conversation. ''
<p/>This honest Turk,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) to Pangloss and Martin, <div class="bookquote">``seems to be in a situation far preferable to that of the six kings with whom we had the honour of supping.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Grandeur,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>said Pangloss, <div class="bookquote">``is extremely dangerous according to the testimony of philosophers. For, in short, Eglon, King of Moab, was assassinated by Ehud; Absalom was hung by his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hair, and pierced with three darts; King Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, was killed by Baasa; King Ela by Zimri; Ahaziah by Jehu; Athaliah by Jehoiada; the Kings Jehoiakim, Jeconiah, and Zedekiah, were led into captivity.

You know--''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know also,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Candide, <div class="bookquote">``that we must cultivate our garden.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div>said Pangloss, <div class="bookquote">``for when man was first placed in the Garden of Eden, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was put there ut operaretur eum , that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might cultivate it; which shows that man was not born to be idle.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pangloss/Dr. Pangloss/PANGLOSS</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let us work,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin, <div class="bookquote">``without disputing; it is the only way to render life tolerable. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/MARTIN/Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>The whole little society entered into this laudable design, according to their different abilities. Their little plot of land produced plentiful crops. Cunegonde was, indeed, very ugly, but she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became an excellent pastry cook; Paquette worked at embroidery; the old woman looked after the linen. They were all, not excepting Friar Giroflée, of some service or other; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Giroflée</b></font>) made a good joiner, and became a very honest man.
<p/>Pangloss sometimes said to Candide: <div class="bookquote">``There is a concatenation of events in this best of all possible worlds: for if you had not been kicked out of a magnificent castle for love of Miss Cunegonde: if you had not been put into the Inquisition: if you had not walked over America: if you had not stabbed the Baron: if you had not lost all your sheep from the fine country of El Dorado: you would not be here eating preserved citrons and pistachio-nuts.''
