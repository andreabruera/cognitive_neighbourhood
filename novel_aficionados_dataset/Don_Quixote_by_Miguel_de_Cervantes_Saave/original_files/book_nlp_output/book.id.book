perfect as I think her to be ; and I can not satisfy myself of the truth on this point except by testing her in such a way that the trial may prove the purity of her virtue as the fire proves that of gold ; because I am persuaded , my friend , that a woman is virtuous only in proportion as she is or is not tempted ; and that she alone is strong who does not yield to the promises , gifts , tears , and importunities of earnest lovers ; for what thanks does a woman deserve for being good if no one urges her to be bad , and what wonder is it that she is reserved and circumspect to whom no opportunity is given of going wrong and who knows she has a husband that will take her life the first time he detects her in an impropriety ? I do not therefore hold her who is virtuous through fear or want of opportunity in the same estimation as her who comes out of temptation and trial with a crown of victory ; and so , for these reasons and many others that I could give thee to justify and support the opinion I hold , I am desirous that my wife Camilla should pass this crisis , and be refined and tested by the fire of finding herself wooed and by one worthy to set his affections upon her ; and if she comes out , as I know she will , victorious from this struggle , I shall look upon my good fortune as unequalled , I shall be able to say that the cup of my desire is full , and that the virtuous woman of whom the sage says ` Who shall find her ? ' has fallen to my lot . And if the result be the contrary of what I expect , in the satisfaction of knowing that I have been right in my opinion , I shall bear without complaint the pain which my so dearly bought experience will naturally cause me . And , as nothing of all thou wilt urge in opposition to my wish will avail to keep me from carrying it into effect , it is my desire , friend Lothario , that thou shouldst consent to become the instrument for effecting this purpose that I am bent upon , for I will afford thee opportunities to that end , and nothing shall be wanting that I may think necessary for the pursuit of a virtuous , honourable , modest and high-minded woman . And among other reasons , I am induced to entrust this arduous task to thee by the consideration that if Camilla be conquered by thee the conquest will not be pushed to extremes , but only far enough to account that accomplished which from a sense of honour will be left undone ; thus I shall not be wronged in anything more than intention , and my wrong will remain buried in the integrity of thy silence , which I know well will be as lasting as that of death in what concerns me . If , therefore , thou wouldst have me enjoy what can be called life , thou wilt at once engage in this love struggle , not lukewarmly nor slothfully , but with the energy and zeal that my desire demands , and with the loyalty our friendship assures me of . '' ","i":156100},{"w":"`` I can not persuade myself , Anselmo my friend , that what thou hast said to me is not in jest ; if I thought that thou wert speaking seriously I would not have allowed thee to go so far ; so as to put a stop to thy long harangue by not listening to thee I verily suspect that either thou dost not know me , or I do not know thee ; but no , I know well thou art Anselmo , and thou knowest that I am Lothario ; the misfortune is , it seems to me , that thou art not the Anselmo thou wert , and must have thought that I am not the Lothario I should be ; for the things that thou hast said to me are not those of that Anselmo who was my friend , nor are those that thou demandest of me what should be asked of the Lothario thou knowest . True friends will prove their friends and make use of them , as a poet has said , usque ad aras ; whereby he meant that they will not make use of their friendship in things that are contrary to God 's will . If this , then , was a heathen 's feeling about friendship , how much more should it be a Christian 's , who knows that the divine must not be forfeited for the sake of any human friendship ? And if a friend should go so far as to put aside his duty to Heaven to fulfil his duty to his friend , it should not be in matters that are trifling or of little moment , but in such as affect the friend 's life and honour . Now tell me , Anselmo , in which of these two art thou imperilled , that I should hazard myself to gratify thee , and do a thing so detestable as that thou seekest of me ? Neither forsooth ; on the contrary , thou dost ask of me , so far as I understand , to strive and labour to rob thee of honour and life , and to rob myself of them at the same time ; for if I take away thy honour it is plain I take away thy life , as a man without honour is worse than dead ; and being the instrument , as thou wilt have it so , of so much wrong to thee , shall not I , too , be left without honour , and consequently without life ? Listen to me , Anselmo my friend , and be not impatient to answer me until I have said what occurs to me touching the object of thy desire , for there will be time enough left for thee to reply and for me to hear .

This being so , thou must remember that I am now labouring under that infirmity which women sometimes suffer from , when the craving seizes them to eat clay , plaster , charcoal , and things even worse , disgusting to look at , much more to eat ; so that it will be necessary to have recourse to some artifice to cure me ; and this can be easily effected if only thou wilt make a beginning , even though it be in a lukewarm and make-believe fashion , to pay court to Camilla , who will not be so yielding that her virtue will give way at the first attack : with this mere attempt I shall rest satisfied , and thou wilt have done what our friendship binds thee to do , not only in giving me life , but in persuading me not to discard my honour . And this thou art bound to do for one reason alone , that , being , as I am , resolved to apply this test , it is not for thee to permit me to reveal my weakness to another , and so imperil that honour thou art striving to keep me from losing ; and if thine may not stand as high as it ought in the estimation of Camilla while thou art paying court to her , that is of little or no importance , because ere long , on finding in her that constancy which we expect , thou canst tell her the plain truth as regards our stratagem , and so regain thy place in her esteem ; and as thou art venturing so little , and by the venture canst afford me so much satisfaction , refuse not to undertake it , even if further difficulties present themselves to thee ; for , as I have said , if thou wilt only make a beginning I will acknowledge the issue decided .

But , to make an end , not many months had passed after he returned from Salamanca , when one day he appeared dressed as a shepherd with his crook and sheepskin , having put off the long gown he wore as a scholar ; and at the same time his great friend , Ambrosio by name , who had been his companion in his studies , took to the shepherd 's dress with him . I forgot to say that Chrysostom , who is dead , was a great man for writing verses , so much so that he made carols for Christmas Eve , and plays for Corpus Christi , which the young men of our village acted , and all said they were excellent . When the villagers saw the two scholars so unexpectedly appearing in shepherd 's dress , they were lost in wonder , and could not guess what had led them to make so extraordinary a change . About this time the father of our Chrysostom died , and he was left heir to a large amount of property in chattels as well as in land , no small number of cattle and sheep , and a large sum of money , of all of which the young man was left dissolute owner , and indeed he was deserving of it all , for he was a very good comrade , and kind-hearted , and a friend of worthy folk , and had a countenance like a benediction . Presently it came to be known that he had changed his dress with no other object than to wander about these wastes after that shepherdess Marcela our lad mentioned a while ago , with whom the deceased Chrysostom had fallen in love . And I must tell you now , for it is well you should know it , who this girl is ; perhaps , and even without any perhaps , you will not have heard anything like it all the days of your life , though you should live more years than sarna . '' ","i":54830},{"w":"`` and if , senor , you must go finding fault with words at every step , we shall not make an end of it this twelvemonth . '' ","i":55225},{"w":"`` May that of the Lord not be wanting to me , '' ","i":55804},{"w":"`` that is the one to have . To proceed ; you must know that though the uncle put before his niece and described to her the qualities of each one in particular of the many who had asked her in marriage , begging her to marry and make a choice according to her own taste , she never gave any other answer than that she had no desire to marry just yet , and that being so young she did not think herself fit to bear the burden of matrimony . At these , to all appearance , reasonable excuses that she made , her uncle ceased to urge her , and waited till she was somewhat more advanced in age and could mate herself to her own liking . For , said he -- and he said quite right -- parents are not to settle children in life against their will . But when one least looked for it , lo and behold ! one day the demure Marcela makes her appearance turned shepherdess ; and , in spite of her uncle and all those of the town that strove to dissuade her , took to going a-field with the other shepherd-lasses of the village , and tending her own flock . And so , since she appeared in public , and her beauty came to be seen openly , I could not well tell you how many rich youths , gentlemen and peasants , have adopted the costume of Chrysostom , and go about these fields making love to her . One of these , as has been already said , was our deceased friend , of whom they say that he did not love but adore her . But you must not suppose , because Marcela chose a life of such liberty and independence , and of so little or rather no retirement , that she has given any occasion , or even the semblance of one , for disparagement of her purity and modesty ; on the contrary , such and so great is the vigilance with which she watches over her honour , that of all those that court and woo her not one has boasted , or can with truth boast , that she has given him any hope however small of obtaining his desire . For although she does not avoid or shun the society and conversation of the shepherds , and treats them courteously and kindly , should any one of them come to declare his intention to her , though it be one as proper and holy as that of matrimony , she flings him from her like a catapult . And with this kind of disposition she does more harm in this country than if the plague had got into it , for her affability and her beauty draw on the hearts of those that associate with her to love her and to court her , but her scorn and her frankness bring them to the brink of despair ; and so they know not what to say save to proclaim her aloud cruel and hard-hearted , and other names of the same sort which well describe the nature of her character ; and if you should remain here any time , senor , you would hear these hills and valleys resounding with the laments of the rejected ones who pursue her . Not far from this there is a spot where there are a couple of dozen of tall beeches , and there is not one of them but has carved and written on its smooth bark the name of Marcela , and above some a crown carved on the same tree as though her lover would say more plainly that Marcela wore and deserved that of all human beauty . Here one shepherd is sighing , there another is lamenting ; there love songs are heard , here despairing elegies . One will pass all the hours of the night seated at the foot of some oak or rock , and there , without having closed his weeping eyes , the sun finds him in the morning bemused and bereft of sense ; and another without relief or respite to his sighs , stretched on the burning sand in the full heat of the sultry summer noontide , makes his appeal to the compassionate heavens , and over one and the other , over these and all , the beautiful Marcela triumphs free and careless . And all of us that know her are waiting to see what her pride will come to , and who is to be the happy man that will succeed in taming a nature so formidable and gaining possession of a beauty so supreme . All that I have told you being such well-established truth , I am persuaded that what they say of the cause of Chrysostom 's death , as our lad told us , is the same . And so I advise you , senor , fail not to be present to-morrow at his burial , which will be well worth seeing , for Chrysostom had many friends , and it is not half a league from this place to where he directed he should be buried .

And though it is plain they could not do without eating and performing all the other natural functions , because , in fact , they were men like ourselves , it is plain too that , wandering as they did the most part of their lives through woods and wilds and without a cook , their most usual fare would be rustic viands such as those thou now offer me ; so that , friend Sancho , let not that distress thee which pleases me , and do not seek to make a new world or pervert knight-errantry .

'' ","i":57388},{"w":"`` read the annals and histories of England , in which are recorded the famous deeds of King Arthur , whom we in our popular Castilian invariably call King Artus , with regard to whom it is an ancient tradition , and commonly received all over that kingdom of Great Britain , that this king did not die , but was changed by magic art into a raven , and that in process of time he is to return to reign and recover his kingdom and sceptre ; for which reason it can not be proved that from that time to this any Englishman ever killed a raven ? Well , then , in the time of this good king that famous order of chivalry of the Knights of the Round Table was instituted , and the amour of Don Lancelot of the Lake with the Queen Guinevere occurred , precisely as is there related , the go-between and confidante therein being the highly honourable dame Quintanona , whence came that ballad so well known and widely spread in our Spain -- O never surely was there knight So served by hand of dame , As served was he Sir Lancelot hight When he from Britain came -- with all the sweet and delectable course of his achievements in love and war . Handed down from that time , then , this order of chivalry went on extending and spreading itself over many and various parts of the world ; and in it , famous and renowned for their deeds , were the mighty Amadis of Gaul with all his sons and descendants to the fifth generation , and the valiant Felixmarte of Hircania , and the never sufficiently praised Tirante el Blanco , and in our own days almost we have seen and heard and talked with the invincible knight Don Belianis of Greece . This , then , sirs , is to be a knight-errant , and what I have spoken of is the order of his chivalry , of which , as I have already said , I , though a sinner , have made profession , and what the aforesaid knights professed that same do I profess , and so I go through these solitudes and wilds seeking adventures , resolved in soul to oppose my arm and person to the most perilous that fortune may offer me in aid of the weak and needy . '' ","i":57502},{"w":"`` It seems to me , Senor Knight-errant , that your worship has made choice of one of the most austere professions in the world , and I imagine even that of the Carthusian monks is not so austere . '' ","i":58019},{"w":"`` As austere it may perhaps be , '' ","i":58060},{"w":"`` but so necessary for the world I am very much inclined to doubt . For , if the truth is to be told , the soldier who executes what his captain orders does no less than the captain himself who gives the order . My meaning , is , that churchmen in peace and quiet pray to Heaven for the welfare of the world , but we soldiers and knights carry into effect what they pray for , defending it with the might of our arms and the edge of our swords , not under shelter but in the open air , a target for the intolerable rays of the sun in summer and the piercing frosts of winter . Thus are we God 's ministers on earth and the arms by which his justice is done therein . And as the business of war and all that relates and belongs to it can not be conducted without exceeding great sweat , toil , and exertion , it follows that those who make it their profession have undoubtedly more labour than those who in tranquil peace and quiet are engaged in praying to God to help the weak . I do not mean to say , nor does it enter into my thoughts , that the knight-errant 's calling is as good as that of the monk in his cell ; I would merely infer from what I endure myself that it is beyond a doubt a more laborious and a more belaboured one , a hungrier and thirstier , a wretcheder , raggeder , and lousier ; for there is no reason to doubt that the knights-errant of yore endured much hardship in the course of their lives . And if some of them by the might of their arms did rise to be emperors , in faith it cost them dear in the matter of blood and sweat ; and if those who attained to that rank had not had magicians and sages to help them they would have been completely baulked in their ambition and disappointed in their hopes . '' ","i":58074},{"w":"`` Sir , '' ","i":58545},{"w":"`` that can not be on any account omitted , and the knight-errant would be disgraced who acted otherwise : for it is usual and customary in knight-errantry that the knight-errant , who on engaging in any great feat of arms has his lady before him , should turn his eyes towards her softly and lovingly , as though with them entreating her to favour and protect him in the hazardous venture he is about to undertake , and even though no one hear him , he is bound to say certain words between his teeth , commending himself to her with all his heart , and of this we have innumerable instances in the histories . Nor is it to be supposed from this that they are to omit commending themselves to God , for there will be time and opportunity for doing so while they are engaged in their task . '' ","i":58553},{"w":"`` That is impossible , '' ","i":58935},{"w":"`` Sir , one solitary swallow does not make summer ; moreover , I know that knight was in secret very deeply in love ; besides which , that way of falling in love with all that took his fancy was a natural propensity which he could not control .

'' ","i":59123},{"w":"`` I can not say positively whether my sweet enemy is pleased or not that the world should know I serve her ; I can only say in answer to what has been so courteously asked of me , that her name is Dulcinea , her country El Toboso , a village of La Mancha , her rank must be at least that of a princess , since she is my queen and lady , and her beauty superhuman , since all the impossible and fanciful attributes of beauty which the poets apply to their ladies are verified in her ; for her hairs are gold , her forehead Elysian fields , her eyebrows rainbows , her eyes suns , her cheeks roses , her lips coral , her teeth pearls , her neck alabaster , her bosom marble , her hands ivory , her fairness snow , and what modesty conceals from sight such , I think and imagine , as rational reflection can only extol , not compare .

He loved deeply , he was hated ; he adored , he was scorned ; he wooed a wild beast , he pleaded with marble , he pursued the wind , he cried to the wilderness , he served ingratitude , and for reward was made the prey of death in the mid-course of life , cut short by a shepherdess whom he sought to immortalise in the memory of man , as these papers which you see could fully prove , had he not commanded me to consign them to the fire after having consigned his body to the earth .

For I would have thee know , Sancho , that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be in hand inflict no indignity , and this is laid down in the law of the duel in express words : if , for instance , the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has in his hand , though it be in fact a piece of wood , it can not be said for that reason that he whom he struck with it has been cudgelled . I say this lest thou shouldst imagine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore suffered any indignity ; for the arms those men carried , with which they pounded us , were nothing more than their stakes , and not one of them , so far as I remember , carried rapier , sword , or dagger .

There was Gandalin , the squire of Amadis of Gaul , that was Count of the Insula Firme , and we read of him that he always addressed his lord with his cap in his hand , his head bowed down and his body bent double , more turquesco .

There is another thing , too , that is wanting ; for supposing we find a king who is at war and has a beautiful daughter , and that I have won incredible fame throughout the universe , I know not how it can be made out that I am of royal lineage , or even second cousin to an emperor ; for the king will not be willing to give me his daughter in marriage unless he is first thoroughly satisfied on this point , however much my famous deeds may deserve it ; so that by this deficiency I fear I shall lose what my arm has fairly earned . True it is I am a gentleman of known house , of estate and property , and entitled to the five hundred sueldos mulct ; and it may be that the sage who shall write my history will so clear up my ancestry and pedigree that I may find myself fifth or sixth in descent from a king ; for I would have thee know , Sancho , that there are two kinds of lineages in the world ; some there be tracing and deriving their descent from kings and princes , whom time has reduced little by little until they end in a point like a pyramid upside down ; and others who spring from the common herd and go on rising step by step until they come to be great lords ; so that the difference is that the one were what they no longer are , and the others are what they formerly were not . And I may be of such that after investigation my origin may prove great and famous , with which the king , my father-in-law that is to be , ought to be satisfied ; and should he not be , the princess will so love me that even though she well knew me to be the son of a water-carrier , she will take me for her lord and husband in spite of her father ; if not , then it comes to seizing her and carrying her off where I please ; for time or death will put an end to the wrath of her parents .

'' ","i":94991},{"w":"`` Thou wilt look well , '' ","i":95204},{"w":"`` but thou must shave thy beard often , for thou hast it so thick and rough and unkempt , that if thou dost not shave it every second day at least , they will see what thou art at the distance of a musket shot .

'' ","i":106930},{"w":"`` My name is Cardenio , my birthplace one of the best cities of this Andalusia , my family noble , my parents rich , my misfortune so great that my parents must have wept and my family grieved over it without being able by their wealth to lighten it ; for the gifts of fortune can do little to relieve reverses sent by Heaven . In that same country there was a heaven in which love had placed all the glory I could desire ; such was the beauty of Luscinda , a damsel as noble and as rich as I , but of happier fortunes , and of less firmness than was due to so worthy a passion as mine . This Luscinda I loved , worshipped , and adored from my earliest and tenderest years , and she loved me in all the innocence and sincerity of childhood . Our parents were aware of our feelings , and were not sorry to perceive them , for they saw clearly that as they ripened they must lead at last to a marriage between us , a thing that seemed almost prearranged by the equality of our families and wealth . We grew up , and with our growth grew the love between us , so that the father of Luscinda felt bound for propriety 's sake to refuse me admission to his house , in this perhaps imitating the parents of that Thisbe so celebrated by the poets , and this refusal but added love to love and flame to flame ; for though they enforced silence upon our tongues they could not impose it upon our pens , which can make known the heart 's secrets to a loved one more freely than tongues ; for many a time the presence of the object of love shakes the firmest will and strikes dumb the boldest tongue . Ah heavens ! how many letters did I write her , and how many dainty modest replies did I receive ! how many ditties and love-songs did I compose in which my heart declared and made known its feelings , described its ardent longings , revelled in its recollections and dallied with its desires ! At length growing impatient and feeling my heart languishing with longing to see her , I resolved to put into execution and carry out what seemed to me the best mode of winning my desired and merited reward , to ask her of her father for my lawful wife , which I did . To this his answer was that he thanked me for the disposition I showed to do honour to him and to regard myself as honoured by the bestowal of his treasure ; but that as my father was alive it was his by right to make this demand , for if it were not in accordance with his full will and pleasure , Luscinda was not to be taken or given by stealth . I thanked him for his kindness , reflecting that there was reason in what he said , and that my father would assent to it as soon as I should tell him , and with that view I went the very same instant to let him know what my desires were . When I entered the room where he was I found him with an open letter in his hand , which , before I could utter a word , he gave me , saying , ' By this letter thou wilt see , Cardenio , the disposition the Duke Ricardo has to serve thee . ' This Duke Ricardo , as you , sirs , probably know already , is a grandee of Spain who has his seat in the best part of this Andalusia . I took and read the letter , which was couched in terms so flattering that even I myself felt it would be wrong in my father not to comply with the request the duke made in it , which was that he would send me immediately to him , as he wished me to become the companion , not servant , of his eldest son , and would take upon himself the charge of placing me in a position corresponding to the esteem in which he held me . On reading the letter my voice failed me , and still more when I heard my father say , ` Two days hence thou wilt depart , Cardenio , in accordance with the duke 's wish , and give thanks to God who is opening a road to thee by which thou mayest attain what I know thou dost deserve ; and to these words he added others of fatherly counsel . The time for my departure arrived ; I spoke one night to Luscinda , I told her all that had occurred , as I did also to her father , entreating him to allow some delay , and to defer the disposal of her hand until I should see what the Duke Ricardo sought of me : he gave me the promise , and she confirmed it with vows and swoonings unnumbered . Finally , I presented myself to the duke , and was received and treated by him so kindly that very soon envy began to do its work , the old servants growing envious of me , and regarding the duke 's inclination to show me favour as an injury to themselves . But the one to whom my arrival gave the greatest pleasure was the duke 's second son , Fernando by name , a gallant youth , of noble , generous , and amorous disposition , who very soon made so intimate a friend of me that it was remarked by everybody ; for though the elder was attached to me , and showed me kindness , he did not carry his affectionate treatment to the same length as Don Fernando . It so happened , then , that as between friends no secret remains unshared , and as the favour I enjoyed with Don Fernando had grown into friendship , he made all his thoughts known to me , and in particular a love affair which troubled his mind a little . He was deeply in love with a peasant girl , a vassal of his father 's , the daughter of wealthy parents , and herself so beautiful , modest , discreet , and virtuous , that no one who knew her was able to decide in which of these respects she was most highly gifted or most excelled . The attractions of the fair peasant raised the passion of Don Fernando to such a point that , in order to gain his object and overcome her virtuous resolutions , he determined to pledge his word to her to become her husband , for to attempt it in any other way was to attempt an impossibility . Bound to him as I was by friendship , I strove by the best arguments and the most forcible examples I could think of to restrain and dissuade him from such a course ; but perceiving I produced no effect I resolved to make the Duke Ricardo , his father , acquainted with the matter ; but Don Fernando , being sharp-witted and shrewd , foresaw and apprehended this , perceiving that by my duty as a good servant I was bound not to keep concealed a thing so much opposed to the honour of my lord the duke ; and so , to mislead and deceive me , he told me he could find no better way of effacing from his mind the beauty that so enslaved him than by absenting himself for some months , and that he wished the absence to be effected by our going , both of us , to my father 's house under the pretence , which he would make to the duke , of going to see and buy some fine horses that there were in my city , which produces the best in the world . When I heard him say so , even if his resolution had not been so good a one I should have hailed it as one of the happiest that could be imagined , prompted by my affection , seeing what a favourable chance and opportunity it offered me of returning to see my Luscinda . With this thought and wish I commended his idea and encouraged his design , advising him to put it into execution as quickly as possible , as , in truth , absence produced its effect in spite of the most deeply rooted feelings . But , as afterwards appeared , when he said this to me he had already enjoyed the peasant girl under the title of husband , and was waiting for an opportunity of making it known with safety to himself , being in dread of what his father the duke would do when he came to know of his folly . It happened , then , that as with young men love is for the most part nothing more than appetite , which , as its final object is enjoyment , comes to an end on obtaining it , and that which seemed to be love takes to flight , as it can not pass the limit fixed by nature , which fixes no limit to true love -- what I mean is that after Don Fernando had enjoyed this peasant girl his passion subsided and his eagerness cooled , and if at first he feigned a wish to absent himself in order to cure his love , he was now in reality anxious to go to avoid keeping his promise . '' ","i":107017},{"w":"`` Had your worship told me at the beginning of your story that the Lady Luscinda was fond of books of chivalry , no other laudation would have been requisite to impress upon me the superiority of her understanding , for it could not have been of the excellence you describe had a taste for such delightful reading been wanting ; so , as far as I am concerned , you need waste no more words in describing her beauty , worth , and intelligence ; for , on merely hearing what her taste was , I declare her to be the most beautiful and the most intelligent woman in the world ; and I wish your worship had , along with Amadis of Gaul , sent her the worthy Don Rugel of Greece , for I know the Lady Luscinda would greatly relish Daraida and Garaya , and the shrewd sayings of the shepherd Darinel , and the admirable verses of his bucolics , sung and delivered by him with such sprightliness , wit , and ease ; but a time may come when this omission can be remedied , and to rectify it nothing more is needed than for your worship to be so good as to come with me to my village , for there I can give you more than three hundred books which are the delight of my soul and the entertainment of my life ; -- though it occurs to me that I have not got one of them now , thanks to the spite of wicked and envious enchanters ; -- but pardon me for having broken the promise we made not to interrupt your discourse ; for when I hear chivalry or knights-errant mentioned , I can no more help talking about them than the rays of the sun can help giving heat , or those of the moon moisture ; pardon me , therefore , and proceed , for that is more to the purpose now .

The truth of the story is that that Master Elisabad whom the madman mentioned was a man of great prudence and sound judgment , and served as governor and physician to the queen , but to suppose that she was his mistress is nonsense deserving very severe punishment ; and as a proof that Cardenio did not know what he was saying , remember when he said it he was out of his wits .

'' ","i":111459},{"w":"`` for if thou dost return soon from the place where I mean to send thee , my penance will be soon over , and my glory will soon begin . But as it is not right to keep thee any longer in suspense , waiting to see what comes of my words , I would have thee know , Sancho , that the famous Amadis of Gaul was one of the most perfect knights-errant -- I am wrong to say he was one ; he stood alone , the first , the only one , the lord of all that were in the world in his time . A fig for Don Belianis , and for all who say he equalled him in any respect , for , my oath upon it , they are deceiving themselves ! I say , too , that when a painter desires to become famous in his art he endeavours to copy the originals of the rarest painters that he knows ; and the same rule holds good for all the most important crafts and callings that serve to adorn a state ; thus must he who would be esteemed prudent and patient imitate Ulysses , in whose person and labours Homer presents to us a lively picture of prudence and patience ; as Virgil , too , shows us in the person of AEneas the virtue of a pious son and the sagacity of a brave and skilful captain ; not representing or describing them as they were , but as they ought to be , so as to leave the example of their virtues to posterity . In the same way Amadis was the polestar , day-star , sun of valiant and devoted knights , whom all we who fight under the banner of love and chivalry are bound to imitate . This , then , being so , I consider , friend Sancho , that the knight-errant who shall imitate him most closely will come nearest to reaching the perfection of chivalry . Now one of the instances in which this knight most conspicuously showed his prudence , worth , valour , endurance , fortitude , and love , was when he withdrew , rejected by the Lady Oriana , to do penance upon the Pena Pobre , changing his name into that of Beltenebros , a name assuredly significant and appropriate to the life which he had voluntarily adopted . So , as it is easier for me to imitate him in this than in cleaving giants asunder , cutting off serpents ' heads , slaying dragons , routing armies , destroying fleets , and breaking enchantments , and as this place is so well suited for a similar purpose , I must not allow the opportunity to escape which now so conveniently offers me its forelock . '' ","i":111595},{"w":"`` Have I not told thee , '' ","i":112102},{"w":"`` that I mean to imitate Amadis here , playing the victim of despair , the madman , the maniac , so as at the same time to imitate the valiant Don Roland , when at the fountain he had evidence of the fair Angelica having disgraced herself with Medoro and through grief thereat went mad , and plucked up trees , troubled the waters of the clear springs , slew destroyed flocks , burned down huts , levelled houses , dragged mares after him , and perpetrated a hundred thousand other outrages worthy of everlasting renown and record ? And though I have no intention of imitating Roland , or Orlando , or Rotolando -LRB- for he went by all these names -RRB- , step by step in all the mad things he did , said , and thought , I will make a rough copy to the best of my power of all that seems to me most essential ; but perhaps I shall content myself with the simple imitation of Amadis , who without giving way to any mischievous madness but merely to tears and sorrow , gained as much fame as the most famous . '' ","i":112114},{"w":"`` There is the point , '' ","i":112382},{"w":"`` and that is the beauty of this business of mine ; no thanks to a knight-errant for going mad when he has cause ; the thing is to turn crazy without any provocation , and let my lady know , if I do this in the dry , what I would do in the moist ; moreover I have abundant cause in the long separation I have endured from my lady till death , Dulcinea del Toboso ; for as thou didst hear that shepherd Ambrosio say the other day , in absence all ills are felt and feared ; and so , friend Sancho , waste no time in advising me against so rare , so happy , and so unheard-of an imitation ; mad I am , and mad I must be until thou returnest with the answer to a letter that I mean to send by thee to my lady Dulcinea ; and if it be such as my constancy deserves , my insanity and penance will come to an end ; and if it be to the opposite effect , I shall become mad in earnest , and , being so , I shall suffer no more ; thus in whatever way she may answer I shall escape from the struggle and affliction in which thou wilt leave me , enjoying in my senses the boon thou bearest me , or as a madman not feeling the evil thou bringest me . But tell me , Sancho , hast thou got Mambrino 's helmet safe ? for I saw thee take it up from the ground when that ungrateful wretch tried to break it in pieces but could not , by which the fineness of its temper may be seen .

And not because it really is so , but because there is always a swarm of enchanters in attendance upon us that change and alter everything with us , and turn things as they please , and according as they are disposed to aid or destroy us ; thus what seems to thee a barber 's basin seems to me Mambrino 's helmet , and to another it will seem something else ; and rare foresight it was in the sage who is on my side to make what is really and truly Mambrine 's helmet seem a basin to everybody , for , being held in such estimation as it is , all the world would pursue me to rob me of it ; but when they see it is only a barber 's basin they do not take the trouble to obtain it ; as was plainly shown by him who tried to break it , and left it on the ground without taking it , for , by my faith , had he known it he would never have left it behind .

' And it will be no great matter if it is in some other person 's hand , for as well as I recollect Dulcinea can neither read nor write , nor in the whole course of her life has she seen handwriting or letter of mine , for my love and hers have been always platonic , not going beyond a modest look , and even that so seldom that I can safely swear I have not seen her four times in all these twelve years I have been loving her more than the light of these eyes that the earth will one day devour ; and perhaps even of those four times she has not once perceived that I was looking at her : such is the retirement and seclusion in which her father Lorenzo Corchuelo and her mother Aldonza Nogales have brought her up . '' ","i":115026},{"w":"`` She it is , '' ","i":115241},{"w":"`` and she it is that is worthy to be lady of the whole universe . '' ","i":115251},{"w":"`` I have before now told thee many times , Sancho , '' ","i":115743},{"w":"`` that thou art a mighty great chatterer , and that with a blunt wit thou art always striving at sharpness ; but to show thee what a fool thou art and how rational I am , I would have thee listen to a short story . Thou must know that a certain widow , fair , young , independent , and rich , and above all free and easy , fell in love with a sturdy strapping young lay-brother ; his superior came to know of it , and one day said to the worthy widow by way of brotherly remonstrance , ' I am surprised , senora , and not without good reason , that a woman of such high standing , so fair , and so rich as you are , should have fallen in love with such a mean , low , stupid fellow as So-and-so , when in this house there are so many masters , graduates , and divinity students from among whom you might choose as if they were a lot of pears , saying this one I 'll take , that I wo n't take ; ' but she replied to him with great sprightliness and candour , ` My dear sir , you are very much mistaken , and your ideas are very old-fashioned , if you think that I have made a bad choice in So-and-so , fool as he seems ; because for all I want with him he knows as much and more philosophy than Aristotle . ' In the same way , Sancho , for all I want with Dulcinea del Toboso she is just as good as the most exalted princess on earth . It is not to be supposed that all those poets who sang the praises of ladies under the fancy names they give them , had any such mistresses . Thinkest thou that the Amarillises , the Phillises , the Sylvias , the Dianas , the Galateas , the Filidas , and all the rest of them , that the books , the ballads , the barber 's shops , the theatres are full of , were really and truly ladies of flesh and blood , and mistresses of those that glorify and have glorified them ? Nothing of the kind ; they only invent them for the most part to furnish a subject for their verses , and that they may pass for lovers , or for men valiant enough to be so ; and so it suffices me to think and believe that the good Aldonza Lorenzo is fair and virtuous ; and as to her pedigree it is very little matter , for no one will examine into it for the purpose of conferring any order upon her , and I , for my part , reckon her the most exalted princess in the world . For thou shouldst know , Sancho , if thou dost not know , that two things alone beyond all others are incentives to love , and these are great beauty and a good name , and these two things are to be found in Dulcinea in the highest degree , for in beauty no one equals her and in good name few approach her ; and to put the whole thing in a nutshell , I persuade myself that all I say is as I say , neither more nor less , and I picture her in my imagination as I would have her to be , as well in beauty as in condition ; Helen approaches her not nor does Lucretia come up to her , nor any other of the famous women of times past , Greek , Barbarian , or Latin ; and let each say what he will , for if in this I am taken to task by the ignorant , I shall not be censured by the critical .

But knowest thou what amazes me , Sancho ? It seems to me thou must have gone and come through the air , for thou hast taken but little more than three days to go to El Toboso and return , though it is more than thirty leagues from here to there . From which I am inclined to think that the sage magician who is my friend , and watches over my interests -LRB- for of necessity there is and must be one , or else I should not be a right knight-errant -RRB- , that this same , I say , must have helped thee to travel without thy knowledge ; for some of these sages will catch up a knight-errant sleeping in his bed , and without his knowing how or in what way it happened , he wakes up the next day more than a thousand leagues away from the place where he went to sleep . And if it were not for this , knights-errant would not be able to give aid to one another in peril , as they do at every turn . For a knight , maybe , is fighting in the mountains of Armenia with some dragon , or fierce serpent , or another knight , and gets the worst of the battle , and is at the point of death ; but when he least looks for it , there appears over against him on a cloud , or chariot of fire , another knight , a friend of his , who just before had been in England , and who takes his part , and delivers him from death ; and at night he finds himself in his own quarters supping very much to his satisfaction ; and yet from one place to the other will have been two or three thousand leagues . And all this is done by the craft and skill of the sage enchanters who take care of those valiant knights ; so that , friend Sancho , I find no difficulty in believing that thou mayest have gone from this place to El Toboso and returned in such a short time , since , as I have said , some friendly sage must have carried thee through the air without thee perceiving it . '' ","i":148109},{"w":"`` Quicksilver !

For thou must know that according to our way of thinking in chivalry , it is a high honour to a lady to have many knights-errant in her service , whose thoughts never go beyond serving her for her own sake , and who look for no other reward for their great and true devotion than that she should be willing to accept them as her knights .

'' ","i":149898},{"w":"`` That your worships may see how important it is to have knights-errant to redress the wrongs and injuries done by tyrannical and wicked men in this world , I may tell you that some days ago passing through a wood , I heard cries and piteous complaints as of a person in pain and distress ; I immediately hastened , impelled by my bounden duty , to the quarter whence the plaintive accents seemed to me to proceed , and I found tied to an oak this lad who now stands before you , which in my heart I rejoice at , for his testimony will not permit me to depart from the truth in any particular . He was , I say , tied to an oak , naked from the waist up , and a clown , whom I afterwards found to be his master , was scarifying him by lashes with the reins of his mare . As soon as I saw him I asked the reason of so cruel a flagellation . The boor replied that he was flogging him because he was his servant and because of carelessness that proceeded rather from dishonesty than stupidity ; on which this boy said , ` Senor , he flogs me only because I ask for my wages . ' The master made I know not what speeches and explanations , which , though I listened to them , I did not accept . In short , I compelled the clown to unbind him , and to swear he would take him with him , and pay him real by real , and perfumed into the bargain . Is not all this true , Andres my son ? Didst thou not mark with what authority I commanded him , and with what humility he promised to do all I enjoined , specified , and required of him ? Answer without hesitation ; tell these gentlemen what took place , that they may see that it is as great an advantage as I say to have knights-errant abroad . '' ","i":149949},{"w":"`` How ! the opposite ? '' ","i":150336},{"w":"`` did not the clown pay thee then ?

And so , senor , let your goodness reinstate the father that begot me in your good opinion , and be assured that he was a wise and prudent man , since by his craft he found out such a sure and easy way of remedying my misfortune ; for I believe , senor , that had it not been for you I should never have lit upon the good fortune I now possess ; and in this I am saying what is perfectly true ; as most of these gentlemen who are present can fully testify .

To this arms make answer that without them laws can not be maintained , for by arms states are defended , kingdoms preserved , cities protected , roads made safe , seas cleared of pirates ; and , in short , if it were not for them , states , kingdoms , monarchies , cities , ways by sea and land would be exposed to the violence and confusion which war brings with it , so long as it lasts and is free to make use of its privileges and powers . And then it is plain that whatever costs most is valued and deserves to be valued most . To attain to eminence in letters costs a man time , watching , hunger , nakedness , headaches , indigestions , and other things of the sort , some of which I have already referred to . But for a man to come in the ordinary course of things to be a good soldier costs him all the student suffers , and in an incomparably higher degree , for at every step he runs the risk of losing his life . For what dread of want or poverty that can reach or harass the student can compare with what the soldier feels , who finds himself beleaguered in some stronghold mounting guard in some ravelin or cavalier , knows that the enemy is pushing a mine towards the post where he is stationed , and can not under any circumstances retire or fly from the imminent danger that threatens him ? All he can do is to inform his captain of what is going on so that he may try to remedy it by a counter-mine , and then stand his ground in fear and expectation of the moment when he will fly up to the clouds without wings and descend into the deep against his will . And if this seems a trifling risk , let us see whether it is equalled or surpassed by the encounter of two galleys stem to stem , in the midst of the open sea , locked and entangled one with the other , when the soldier has no more standing room than two feet of the plank of the spur ; and yet , though he sees before him threatening him as many ministers of death as there are cannon of the foe pointed at him , not a lance length from his body , and sees too that with the first heedless step he will go down to visit the profundities of Neptune 's bosom , still with dauntless heart , urged on by honour that nerves him , he makes himself a target for all that musketry , and struggles to cross that narrow path to the enemy 's ship . And what is still more marvellous , no sooner has one gone down into the depths he will never rise from till the end of the world , than another takes his place ; and if he too falls into the sea that waits for him like an enemy , another and another will succeed him without a moment 's pause between their deaths : courage and daring the greatest that all the chances of war can show . Happy the blest ages that knew not the dread fury of those devilish engines of artillery , whose inventor I am persuaded is in hell receiving the reward of his diabolical invention , by which he made it easy for a base and cowardly arm to take the life of a gallant gentleman ; and that , when he knows not how or whence , in the height of the ardour and enthusiasm that fire and animate brave hearts , there should come some random bullet , discharged perhaps by one who fled in terror at the flash when he fired off his accursed machine , which in an instant puts an end to the projects and cuts off the life of one who deserved to live for ages to come . And thus when I reflect on this , I am almost tempted to say that in my heart I repent of having adopted this profession of knight-errant in so detestable an age as we live in now ; for though no peril can make me fear , still it gives me some uneasiness to think that powder and lead may rob me of the opportunity of making myself famous and renowned throughout the known earth by the might of my arm and the edge of my sword . But Heaven 's will be done ; if I succeed in my attempt I shall be all the more honoured , as I have faced greater dangers than the knights-errant of yore exposed themselves to .

By God , it puzzles me ! But perhaps the chivalry and enchantments of our day take a different course from that of those in days gone by ; and it may be , too , that as I am a new knight in the world , and the first to revive the already forgotten calling of knight-adventurers , they may have newly invented other kinds of enchantments and other modes of carrying off the enchanted .

I am a knight-errant , and not one of those whose names Fame has never thought of immortalising in her record , but of those who , in defiance and in spite of envy itself , and all the magicians that Persia , or Brahmans that India , or Gymnosophists that Ethiopia ever produced , will place their names in the temple of immortality , to serve as examples and patterns for ages to come , whereby knights-errant may see the footsteps in which they must tread if they would attain the summit and crowning point of honour in arms . '' ","i":227582},{"w":"`` To tell the truth , senor curate , I for my part consider what they call books of chivalry to be mischievous to the State ; and though , led by idle and false taste , I have read the beginnings of almost all that have been printed , I never could manage to read any one of them from beginning to end ; for it seems to me they are all more or less the same thing ; and one has nothing more in it than another ; this no more than that . And in my opinion this sort of writing and composition is of the same species as the fables they call the Milesian , nonsensical tales that aim solely at giving amusement and not instruction , exactly the opposite of the apologue fables which amuse and instruct at the same time . And though it may be the chief object of such books to amuse , I do not know how they can succeed , when they are so full of such monstrous nonsense . For the enjoyment the mind feels must come from the beauty and harmony which it perceives or contemplates in the things that the eye or the imagination brings before it ; and nothing that has any ugliness or disproportion about it can give any pleasure . What beauty , then , or what proportion of the parts to the whole , or of the whole to the parts , can there be in a book or fable where a lad of sixteen cuts down a giant as tall as a tower and makes two halves of him as if he was an almond cake ? And when they want to give us a picture of a battle , after having told us that there are a million of combatants on the side of the enemy , let the hero of the book be opposed to them , and we have perforce to believe , whether we like it or not , that the said knight wins the victory by the single might of his strong arm . And then , what shall we say of the facility with which a born queen or empress will give herself over into the arms of some unknown wandering knight ? What mind , that is not wholly barbarous and uncultured , can find pleasure in reading of how a great tower full of knights sails away across the sea like a ship with a fair wind , and will be to-night in Lombardy and to-morrow morning in the land of Prester John of the Indies , or some other that Ptolemy never described nor Marco Polo saw ? And if , in answer to this , I am told that the authors of books of the kind write them as fiction , and therefore are not bound to regard niceties of truth , I would reply that fiction is all the better the more it looks like truth , and gives the more pleasure the more probability and possibility there is about it . Plots in fiction should be wedded to the understanding of the reader , and be constructed in such a way that , reconciling impossibilities , smoothing over difficulties , keeping the mind on the alert , they may surprise , interest , divert , and entertain , so that wonder and delight joined may keep pace one with the other ; all which he will fail to effect who shuns verisimilitude and truth to nature , wherein lies the perfection of writing . I have never yet seen any book of chivalry that puts together a connected plot complete in all its numbers , so that the middle agrees with the beginning , and the end with the beginning and middle ; on the contrary , they construct them with such a multitude of members that it seems as though they meant to produce a chimera or monster rather than a well-proportioned figure . And besides all this they are harsh in their style , incredible in their achievements , licentious in their amours , uncouth in their courtly speeches , prolix in their battles , silly in their arguments , absurd in their travels , and , in short , wanting in everything like intelligent art ; for which reason they deserve to be banished from the Christian commonwealth as a worthless breed .

And to prove this I want to ask you one thing ; and if you answer me as I believe you will answer , you will be able to lay your finger on the trick , and you will see that you are not enchanted but gone wrong in your wits .

I know and feel that I am enchanted , and that is enough to ease my conscience ; for it would weigh heavily on it if I thought that I was not enchanted , and that in a faint-hearted and cowardly way I allowed myself to lie in this cage , defrauding multitudes of the succour I might afford to those in need and distress , who at this very moment may be in sore want of my aid and protection .

For to try to persuade anybody that Amadis , and all the other knights-adventurers with whom the books are filled , never existed , would be like trying to persuade him that the sun does not yield light , or ice cold , or earth nourishment . What wit in the world can persuade another that the story of the Princess Floripes and Guy of Burgundy is not true , or that of Fierabras and the bridge of Mantible , which happened in the time of Charlemagne ? For by all that is good it is as true as that it is daylight now ; and if it be a lie , it must be a lie too that there was a Hector , or Achilles , or Trojan war , or Twelve Peers of France , or Arthur of England , who still lives changed into a raven , and is unceasingly looked for in his kingdom . One might just as well try to make out that the history of Guarino Mezquino , or of the quest of the Holy Grail , is false , or that the loves of Tristram and the Queen Yseult are apocryphal , as well as those of Guinevere and Lancelot , when there are persons who can almost remember having seen the Dame Quintanona , who was the best cupbearer in Great Britain . And so true is this , that I recollect a grandmother of mine on the father 's side , whenever she saw any dame in a venerable hood , used to say to me , ` Grandson , that one is like Dame Quintanona , ' from which I conclude that she must have known her , or at least had managed to see some portrait of her . Then who can deny that the story of Pierres and the fair Magalona is true , when even to this day may be seen in the king 's armoury the pin with which the valiant Pierres guided the wooden horse he rode through the air , and it is a trifle bigger than the pole of a cart ? And alongside of the pin is Babieca 's saddle , and at Roncesvalles there is Roland 's horn , as large as a large beam ; whence we may infer that there were Twelve Peers , and a Pierres , and a Cid , and other knights like them , of the sort people commonly call adventurers . Or perhaps I shall be told , too , that there was no such knight-errant as the valiant Lusitanian Juan de Merlo , who went to Burgundy and in the city of Arras fought with the famous lord of Charny , Mosen Pierres by name , and afterwards in the city of Basle with Mosen Enrique de Remesten , coming out of both encounters covered with fame and honour ; or adventures and challenges achieved and delivered , also in Burgundy , by the valiant Spaniards Pedro Barba and Gutierre Quixada -LRB- of whose family I come in the direct male line -RRB- , when they vanquished the sons of the Count of San Polo . I shall be told , too , that Don Fernando de Guevara did not go in quest of adventures to Germany , where he engaged in combat with Micer George , a knight of the house of the Duke of Austria . I shall be told that the jousts of Suero de Quinones , him of the ` Paso , ' and the emprise of Mosen Luis de Falces against the Castilian knight , Don Gonzalo de Guzman , were mere mockeries ; as well as many other achievements of Christian knights of these and foreign realms , which are so authentic and true , that , I repeat , he who denies them must be totally wanting in reason and good sense . '' ","i":235747},{"w":"`` I can not deny , Senor Don Quixote , that there is some truth in what you say , especially as regards the Spanish knights-errant ; and I am willing to grant too that the Twelve Peers of France existed , but I am not disposed to believe that they did all the things that the Archbishop Turpin relates of them . For the truth of the matter is they were knights chosen by the kings of France , and called ` Peers ' because they were all equal in worth , rank and prowess -LRB- at least if they were not they ought to have been -RRB- , and it was a kind of religious order like those of Santiago and Calatrava in the present day , in which it is assumed that those who take it are valiant knights of distinction and good birth ; and just as we say now a Knight of St. John , or of Alcantara , they used to say then a Knight of the Twelve Peers , because twelve equals were chosen for that military order . That there was a Cid , as well as a Bernardo del Carpio , there can be no doubt ; but that they did the deeds people say they did , I hold to be very doubtful . In that other matter of the pin of Count Pierres that you speak of , and say is near Babieca 's saddle in the Armoury , I confess my sin ; for I am either so stupid or so short-sighted , that , though I have seen the saddle , I have never been able to see the pin , in spite of it being as big as your worship says it is .

Give me your attention and follow me . Is it , pray , any new thing for a single knight-errant to demolish an army of two hundred thousand men , as if they all had but one throat or were made of sugar paste ? Nay , tell me , how many histories are there filled with these marvels ?

If any these were alive to-day , and were to come face to face with the Turk , by my faith , I would not give much for the Turk 's chance .

Master shaver , master shaver ! how blind is he who can not see through a sieve . Is it possible that you do not know that comparisons of wit with wit , valour with valour , beauty with beauty , birth with birth , are always odious and unwelcome ? I , master barber , am not Neptune , the god of the waters , nor do I try to make anyone take me for an astute man , for I am not one . My only endeavour is to convince the world of the mistake it makes in not reviving in itself the happy time when the order of knight-errantry was in the field . But our depraved age does not deserve to enjoy such a blessing as those ages enjoyed when knights-errant took upon their shoulders the defence of kingdoms , the protection of damsels , the succour of orphans and minors , the chastisement of the proud , and the recompense of the humble . With the knights of these days , for the most part , it is the damask , brocade , and rich stuffs they wear , that rustle as they go , not the chain mail of their armour ; no knight now-a-days sleeps in the open field exposed to the inclemency of heaven , and in full panoply from head to foot ; no one now takes a nap , as they call it , without drawing his feet out of the stirrups , and leaning upon his lance , as the knights-errant used to do ; no one now , issuing from the wood , penetrates yonder mountains , and then treads the barren , lonely shore of the sea -- mostly a tempestuous and stormy one -- and finding on the beach a little bark without oars , sail , mast , or tackling of any kind , in the intrepidity of his heart flings himself into it and commits himself to the wrathful billows of the deep sea , that one moment lift him up to heaven and the next plunge him into the depths ; and opposing his breast to the irresistible gale , finds himself , when he least expects it , three thousand leagues and more away from the place where he embarked ; and leaping ashore in a remote and unknown land has adventures that deserve to be written , not on parchment , but on brass . But now sloth triumphs over energy , indolence over exertion , vice over virtue , arrogance over courage , and theory over practice in arms , which flourished and shone only in the golden ages and in knights-errant . For tell me , who was more virtuous and more valiant than the famous Amadis of Gaul ? Who more discreet than Palmerin of England ? Who more gracious and easy than Tirante el Blanco ? Who more courtly than Lisuarte of Greece ? Who more slashed or slashing than Don Belianis ? Who more intrepid than Perion of Gaul ? Who more ready to face danger than Felixmarte of Hircania ? Who more sincere than Esplandian ? Who more impetuous than Don Cirongilio of Thrace ? Who more bold than Rodamonte ? Who more prudent than King Sobrino ? Who more daring than Reinaldos ? Who more invincible than Roland ? and who more gallant and courteous than Ruggiero , from whom the dukes of Ferrara of the present day are descended , according to Turpin in his ` Cosmography . ' All these knights , and many more that I could name , senor curate , were knights-errant , the light and glory of chivalry . These , or such as these , I would have to carry out my plan , and in that case his Majesty would find himself well served and would save great expense , and the Turk would be left tearing his beard . And so I will stay where I am , as the chaplain does not take me away ; and if Jupiter , as the barber has told us , will not send rain , here am I , and I will rain when I please . I say this that Master Basin may know that I understand him . '' ","i":254207},{"w":"`` As to whether I ought to be vexed or not , '' ","i":254992},{"w":"`` I myself am the best judge . '' ","i":255009},{"w":"`` The senor curate has leave for more than that , '' ","i":255059},{"w":"`` so he may declare his doubt , for it is not pleasant to have a doubt on one 's conscience . '' ","i":255075},{"w":"`` That is another mistake , '' ","i":255194},{"w":"`` into which many have fallen who do not believe that there ever were such knights in the world , and I have often , with divers people and on divers occasions , tried to expose this almost universal error to the light of truth . Sometimes I have not been successful in my purpose , sometimes I have , supporting it upon the shoulders of the truth ; which truth is so clear that I can almost say I have with my own eyes seen Amadis of Gaul , who was a man of lofty stature , fair complexion , with a handsome though black beard , of a countenance between gentle and stern in expression , sparing of words , slow to anger , and quick to put it away from him ; and as I have depicted Amadis , so I could , I think , portray and describe all the knights-errant that are in all the histories in the world ; for by the perception I have that they were what their histories describe , and by the deeds they did and the dispositions they displayed , it is possible , with the aid of sound philosophy , to deduce their features , complexion , and stature . '' ","i":255205},{"w":"`` opinions differ as to whether there ever were any or not in the world ; but the Holy Scripture , which can not err by a jot from the truth , shows us that there were , when it gives us the history of that big Philistine , Goliath , who was seven cubits and a half in height , which is a huge size . Likewise , in the island of Sicily , there have been found leg-bones and arm-bones so large that their size makes it plain that their owners were giants , and as tall as great towers ; geometry puts this fact beyond a doubt . But , for all that , I can not speak with certainty as to the size of Morgante , though I suspect he can not have been very tall ; and I am inclined to be of this opinion because I find in the history in which his deeds are particularly mentioned , that he frequently slept under a roof and as he found houses to contain him , it is clear that his bulk could not have been anything excessive . '' ","i":255455},{"w":"`` I venture to say that he was broad-faced , of ruddy complexion , with roguish and somewhat prominent eyes , excessively punctilious and touchy , and given to the society of thieves and scapegraces . With regard to Roland , or Rotolando , or Orlando -LRB- for the histories call him by all these names -RRB- , I am of opinion , and hold , that he was of middle height , broad-shouldered , rather bow-legged , swarthy-complexioned , red-bearded , with a hairy body and a severe expression of countenance , a man of few words , but very polite and well-bred . '' ","i":255713},{"w":"`` That Angelica , senor curate , '' ","i":255896},{"w":"`` was a giddy damsel , flighty and somewhat wanton , and she left the world as full of her vagaries as of the fame of her beauty . She treated with scorn a thousand gentlemen , men of valour and wisdom , and took up with a smooth-faced sprig of a page , without fortune or fame , except such reputation for gratitude as the affection he bore his friend got for him . The great poet who sang her beauty , the famous Ariosto , not caring to sing her adventures after her contemptible surrender -LRB- which probably were not over and above creditable -RRB- , dropped her where he says : How she received the sceptre of Cathay , Some bard of defter quill may sing some day ; and this was no doubt a kind of prophecy , for poets are also called vates , that is to say diviners ; and its truth was made plain ; for since then a famous Andalusian poet has lamented and sung her tears , and another famous and rare poet , a Castilian , has sung her beauty .

What do the common people think of me ? What do the hidalgos ? What do the caballeros ? What do they say of my valour ; of my achievements ; of my courtesy ? How do they treat the task I have undertaken in reviving and restoring to the world the now forgotten order of chivalry ? In short , Sancho , I would have thee tell me all that has come to thine ears on this subject ; and thou art to tell me , without adding anything to the good or taking away anything from the bad ; for it is the duty of loyal vassals to tell the truth to their lords just as it is and in its proper shape , not allowing flattery to add to it or any idle deference to lessen it . And I would have thee know , Sancho , that if the naked truth , undisguised by flattery , came to the ears of princes , times would be different , and other ages would be reckoned iron ages more than ours , which I hold to be the golden of these latter days .

Of Alexander , whose deeds won him the name of Great , they say that he was somewhat of a drunkard . Of Hercules , him of the many labours , it is said that he was lewd and luxurious . Of Don Galaor , the brother of Amadis of Gaul , it was whispered that he was over-quarrelsome , and of his brother that he was lachrymose .

' Sometimes he would paint a cock in such a fashion , and so unlike , that he had to write alongside of it in Gothic letters , ` This is a cock ; and so it will be with my history , which will require a commentary to make it intelligible .

In fact , the conclusion I arrive at , senor bachelor , is , that to write histories , or books of any kind , there is need of great judgment and a ripe understanding . To give expression to humour , and write in a strain of graceful pleasantry , is the gift of great geniuses . The cleverest character in comedy is the clown , for he who would make people take him for a fool , must not be one .

There must be all sorts in the world ; and though we may be all knights , there is a great difference between one and another ; for the courtiers , without quitting their chambers , or the threshold of the court , range the world over by looking at a map , without its costing them a farthing , and without suffering heat or cold , hunger or thirst ; but we , the true knights-errant , measure the whole earth with our own feet , exposed to the sun , to the cold , to the air , to the inclemencies of heaven , by day and night , on foot and on horseback ; nor do we only know enemies in pictures , but in their own real shapes ; and at all risks and on all occasions we attack them , without any regard to childish points or rules of single combat , whether one has or has not a shorter lance or sword , whether one carries relics or any secret contrivance about him , whether or not the sun is to be divided and portioned out , and other niceties of the sort that are observed in set combats of man to man , that you know nothing about , but I do . And you must know besides , that the true knight-errant , though he may see ten giants , that not only touch the clouds with their heads but pierce them , and that go , each of them , on two tall towers by way of legs , and whose arms are like the masts of mighty ships , and each eye like a great mill-wheel , and glowing brighter than a glass furnace , must not on any account be dismayed by them . On the contrary , he must attack and fall upon them with a gallant bearing and a fearless heart , and , if possible , vanquish and destroy them , even though they have for armour the shells of a certain fish , that they say are harder than diamonds , and in place of swords wield trenchant blades of Damascus steel , or clubs studded with spikes also of steel , such as I have more than once seen . All this I say , housekeeper , that you may see the difference there is between the one sort of knight and the other ; and it would be well if there were no prince who did not set a higher value on this second , or more properly speaking first , kind of knights-errant ; for , as we read in their histories , there have been some among them who have been the salvation , not merely of one kingdom , but of many . '' ","i":268284},{"w":"`` By the God that gives me life , '' ","i":268849},{"w":"`` if thou wert not my full niece , being daughter of my own sister , I would inflict a chastisement upon thee for the blasphemy thou hast uttered that all the world should ring with . What ! can it be that a young hussy that hardly knows how to handle a dozen lace-bobbins dares to wag her tongue and criticise the histories of knights-errant ? What would Senor Amadis say if he heard of such a thing ? He , however , no doubt would forgive thee , for he was the most humble-minded and courteous knight of his time , and moreover a great protector of damsels ; but some there are that might have heard thee , and it would not have been well for thee in that case ; for they are not all courteous or mannerly ; some are ill-conditioned scoundrels ; nor is it everyone that calls himself a gentleman , that is so in all respects ; some are gold , others pinchbeck , and all look like gentlemen , but not all can stand the touchstone of truth . There are men of low rank who strain themselves to bursting to pass for gentlemen , and high gentlemen who , one would fancy , were dying to pass for men of low rank ; the former raise themselves by their ambition or by their virtues , the latter debase themselves by their lack of spirit or by their vices ; and one has need of experience and discernment to distinguish these two kinds of gentlemen , so much alike in name and so different in conduct . '' ","i":268863},{"w":"`` There is a great deal of truth in what you say , niece , '' ","i":269258},{"w":"`` and I could tell you somewhat about birth that would astonish you ; but , not to mix up things human and divine , I refrain . Look you , my dears , all the lineages in the world -LRB- attend to what I am saying -RRB- can be reduced to four sorts , which are these : those that had humble beginnings , and went on spreading and extending themselves until they attained surpassing greatness ; those that had great beginnings and maintained them , and still maintain and uphold the greatness of their origin ; those , again , that from a great beginning have ended in a point like a pyramid , having reduced and lessened their original greatness till it has come to nought , like the point of a pyramid , which , relatively to its base or foundation , is nothing ; and then there are those -- and it is they that are the most numerous -- that have had neither an illustrious beginning nor a remarkable mid-course , and so will have an end without a name , like an ordinary plebeian line . Of the first , those that had an humble origin and rose to the greatness they still preserve , the Ottoman house may serve as an example , which from an humble and lowly shepherd , its founder , has reached the height at which we now see it . For examples of the second sort of lineage , that began with greatness and maintains it still without adding to it , there are the many princes who have inherited the dignity , and maintain themselves in their inheritance , without increasing or diminishing it , keeping peacefully within the limits of their states . Of those that began great and ended in a point , there are thousands of examples , for all the Pharaohs and Ptolemies of Egypt , the Caesars of Rome , and the whole herd -LRB- if I may apply such a word to them -RRB- of countless princes , monarchs , lords , Medes , Assyrians , Persians , Greeks , and barbarians , all these lineages and lordships have ended in a point and come to nothing , they themselves as well as their founders , for it would be impossible now to find one of their descendants , and , even should we find one , it would be in some lowly and humble condition . Of plebeian lineages I have nothing to say , save that they merely serve to swell the number of those that live , without any eminence to entitle them to any fame or praise beyond this . From all I have said I would have you gather , my poor innocents , that great is the confusion among lineages , and that only those are seen to be great and illustrious that show themselves so by the virtue , wealth , and generosity of their possessors . I have said virtue , wealth , and generosity , because a great man who is vicious will be a great example of vice , and a rich man who is not generous will be merely a miserly beggar ; for the possessor of wealth is not made happy by possessing it , but by spending it , and not by spending as he pleases , but by knowing how to spend it well . The poor gentleman has no way of showing that he is a gentleman but by virtue , by being affable , well-bred , courteous , gentle-mannered , and kindly , not haughty , arrogant , or censorious , but above all by being charitable ; for by two maravedis given with a cheerful heart to the poor , he will show himself as generous as he who distributes alms with bell-ringing , and no one that perceives him to be endowed with the virtues I have named , even though he know him not , will fail to recognise and set him down as one of good blood ; and it would be strange were it not so ; praise has ever been the reward of virtue , and those who are virtuous can not fail to receive commendation . There are two roads , my daughters , by which men may reach wealth and honours ; one is that of letters , the other that of arms . I have more of arms than of letters in my composition , and , judging by my inclination to arms , was born under the influence of the planet Mars . I am , therefore , in a measure constrained to follow that road , and by it I must travel in spite of all the world , and it will be labour in vain for you to urge me to resist what heaven wills , fate ordains , reason requires , and , above all , my own inclination favours ; for knowing as I do the countless toils that are the accompaniments of knight-errantry , I know , too , the infinite blessings that are attained by it ; I know that the path of virtue is very narrow , and the road of vice broad and spacious ; I know their ends and goals are different , for the broad and easy road of vice ends in death , and the narrow and toilsome one of virtue in life , and not transitory life , but in that which has no end ; I know , as our great Castilian poet says , that -- It is by rugged paths like these they go That scale the heights of immortality , Unreached by those that falter here below .

Look here , Sancho , I would readily fix thy wages if I had ever found any instance in the histories of the knights-errant to show or indicate , by the slightest hint , what their squires used to get monthly or yearly ; but I have read all or the best part of their histories , and I can not remember reading of any knight-errant having assigned fixed wages to his squire ; I only know that they all served on reward , and that when they least expected it , if good luck attended their masters , they found themselves recompensed with an island or something equivalent to it , or at the least they were left with a title and lordship . If with these hopes and additional inducements you , Sancho , please to return to my service , well and good ; but to suppose that I am going to disturb or unhinge the ancient usage of knight-errantry , is all nonsense . And so , my Sancho , get you back to your house and explain my intentions to your Teresa , and if she likes and you like to be on reward with me , bene quidem ; if not , we remain friends ; for if the pigeon-house does not lack food , it will not lack pigeons ; and bear in mind , my son , that a good hope is better than a bad holding , and a good grievance better than a bad compensation . I speak in this way , Sancho , to show you that I can shower down proverbs just as well as yourself ; and in short , I mean to say , and I do say , that if you do n't like to come on reward with me , and run the same chance that I run , God be with you and make a saint of you ; for I shall find plenty of squires more obedient and painstaking , and not so thickheaded or talkative as you are . '' ","i":272033},{"w":"`` Didst thou take that for a yard wall , Sancho , '' ","i":274335},{"w":"`` where or at which thou sawest that never sufficiently extolled grace and beauty ?

'' ","i":274433},{"w":"`` What ! dost thou still persist , Sancho , '' ","i":274588},{"w":"`` in saying , thinking , believing , and maintaining that my lady Dulcinea was sifting wheat , that being an occupation and task entirely at variance with what is and should be the employment of persons of distinction , who are constituted and reserved for other avocations and pursuits that show their rank a bowshot off ? Thou hast forgotten , O Sancho , those lines of our poet wherein he paints for us how , in their crystal abodes , those four nymphs employed themselves who rose from their loved Tagus and seated themselves in a verdant meadow to embroider those tissues which the ingenious poet there describes to us , how they were worked and woven with gold and silk and pearls ; and something of this sort must have been the employment of my lady when thou sawest her , only that the spite which some wicked enchanter seems to have against everything of mine changes all those things that give me pleasure , and turns them into shapes unlike their own ; and so I fear that in that history of my achievements which they say is now in print , if haply its author was some sage who is an enemy of mine , he will have put one thing for another , mingling a thousand lies with one truth , and amusing himself by relating transactions which have nothing to do with the sequence of a true history . O envy , root of all countless evils , and cankerworm of the virtues ! All the vices , Sancho , bring some kind of pleasure with them ; but envy brings nothing but irritation , bitterness , and rage . '' ","i":274603},{"w":"`` That , Sancho , '' ","i":275140},{"w":"`` reminds me of what happened to a famous poet of our own day , who , having written a bitter satire against all the courtesan ladies , did not insert or name in it a certain lady of whom it was questionable whether she was one or not . She , seeing she was not in the list of the poet , asked him what he had seen in her that he did not include her in the number of the others , telling him he must add to his satire and put her in the new part , or else look out for the consequences . The poet did as she bade him , and left her without a shred of reputation , and she was satisfied by getting fame though it was infamy . In keeping with this is what they relate of that shepherd who set fire to the famous temple of Diana , by repute one of the seven wonders of the world , and burned it with the sole object of making his name live in after ages ; and , though it was forbidden to name him , or mention his name by word of mouth or in writing , lest the object of his ambition should be attained , nevertheless it became known that he was called Erostratus . And something of the same sort is what happened in the case of the great emperor Charles V and a gentleman in Rome . The emperor was anxious to see that famous temple of the Rotunda , called in ancient times the temple ` of all the gods , ' but now-a-days , by a better nomenclature , ` of all the saints , ' which is the best preserved building of all those of pagan construction in Rome , and the one which best sustains the reputation of mighty works and magnificence of its founders . It is in the form of a half orange , of enormous dimensions , and well lighted , though no light penetrates it save that which is admitted by a window , or rather round skylight , at the top ; and it was from this that the emperor examined the building . A Roman gentleman stood by his side and explained to him the skilful construction and ingenuity of the vast fabric and its wonderful architecture , and when they had left the skylight he said to the emperor , ' A thousand times , your Sacred Majesty , the impulse came upon me to seize your Majesty in my arms and fling myself down from yonder skylight , so as to leave behind me in the world a name that would last for ever . ' ' I am thankful to you for not carrying such an evil thought into effect , ' said the emperor , ` and I shall give you no opportunity in future of again putting your loyalty to the test ; and I therefore forbid you ever to speak to me or to be where I am ; and he followed up these words by bestowing a liberal bounty upon him . My meaning is , Sancho , that the desire of acquiring fame is a very powerful motive . What , thinkest thou , was it that flung Horatius in full armour down from the bridge into the depths of the Tiber ? What burned the hand and arm of Mutius ? What impelled Curtius to plunge into the deep burning gulf that opened in the midst of Rome ? What , in opposition to all the omens that declared against him , made Julius Caesar cross the Rubicon ? And to come to more modern examples , what scuttled the ships , and left stranded and cut off the gallant Spaniards under the command of the most courteous Cortes in the New World ? All these and a variety of other great exploits are , were and will be , the work of fame that mortals desire as a reward and a portion of the immortality their famous deeds deserve ; though we Catholic Christians and knights-errant look more to that future glory that is everlasting in the ethereal regions of heaven than to the vanity of the fame that is to be acquired in this present transitory life ; a fame that , however long it may last , must after all end with the world itself , which has its own appointed end . So that , O Sancho , in what we do we must not overpass the bounds which the Christian religion we profess has assigned to us . We have to slay pride in giants , envy by generosity and nobleness of heart , anger by calmness of demeanour and equanimity , gluttony and sloth by the spareness of our diet and the length of our vigils , lust and lewdness by the loyalty we preserve to those whom we have made the mistresses of our thoughts , indolence by traversing the world in all directions seeking opportunities of making ourselves , besides Christians , famous knights . Such , Sancho , are the means by which we reach those extremes of praise that fair fame carries with it .

The emperor Hadrian had for a tomb a castle as large as a good-sized village , which they called the Moles Adriani , and is now the castle of St. Angelo in Rome . The queen Artemisia buried her husband Mausolus in a tomb which was reckoned one of the seven wonders of the world ; but none of these tombs , or of the many others of the heathens , were ornamented with winding-sheets or any of those other offerings and tokens that show that they who are buried there are saints .

And to prove it , thou knowest already , Sancho , by experience which can not lie or deceive , how easy it is for enchanters to change one countenance into another , turning fair into foul , and foul into fair ; for it is not two days since thou sawest with thine own eyes the beauty and elegance of the peerless Dulcinea in all its perfection and natural harmony , while I saw her in the repulsive and mean form of a coarse country wench , with cataracts in her eyes and a foul smell in her mouth ; and when the perverse enchanter ventured to effect so wicked a transformation , it is no wonder if he effected that of Samson Carrasco and thy gossip in order to snatch the glory of victory out of my grasp .

I have left my home , I have mortgaged my estate , I have given up my comforts , and committed myself to the arms of Fortune , to bear me whithersoever she may please . My desire was to bring to life again knight-errantry , now dead , and for some time past , stumbling here , falling there , now coming down headlong , now raising myself up again , I have carried out a great portion of my design , succouring widows , protecting maidens , and giving aid to wives , orphans , and minors , the proper and natural duty of knights-errant ; and , therefore , because of my many valiant and Christian achievements , I have been already found worthy to make my way in print to well-nigh all , or most , of the nations of the earth . Thirty thousand volumes of my history have been printed , and it is on the high-road to be printed thirty thousand thousands of times , if heaven does not put a stop to it . In short , to sum up all in a few words , or in a single one , I may tell you I am Don Quixote of La Mancha , otherwise called ` The Knight of the Rueful Countenance ; ' for though self-praise is degrading , I must perforce sound my own sometimes , that is to say , when there is no one at hand to do it for me . So that , gentle sir , neither this horse , nor this lance , nor this shield , nor this squire , nor all these arms put together , nor the sallowness of my countenance , nor my gaunt leanness , will henceforth astonish you , now that you know who I am and what profession I follow .

'' ","i":300466},{"w":"`` I , Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance , am a gentleman by birth , native of the village where , please God , we are going to dine to-day ; I am more than fairly well off , and my name is Don Diego de Miranda . I pass my life with my wife , children , and friends ; my pursuits are hunting and fishing , but I keep neither hawks nor greyhounds , nothing but a tame partridge or a bold ferret or two ; I have six dozen or so of books , some in our mother tongue , some Latin , some of them history , others devotional ; those of chivalry have not as yet crossed the threshold of my door ; I am more given to turning over the profane than the devotional , so long as they are books of honest entertainment that charm by their style and attract and interest by the invention they display , though of these there are very few in Spain . Sometimes I dine with my neighbours and friends , and often invite them ; my entertainments are neat and well served without stint of anything . I have no taste for tattle , nor do I allow tattling in my presence ; I pry not into my neighbours ' lives , nor have I lynx-eyes for what others do . I hear mass every day ; I share my substance with the poor , making no display of good works , lest I let hypocrisy and vainglory , those enemies that subtly take possession of the most watchful heart , find an entrance into mine . I strive to make peace between those whom I know to be at variance ; I am the devoted servant of Our Lady , and my trust is ever in the infinite mercy of God our Lord . '' ","i":300592},{"w":"`` Children , senor , are portions of their parents ' bowels , and therefore , be they good or bad , are to be loved as we love the souls that give us life ; it is for the parents to guide them from infancy in the ways of virtue , propriety , and worthy Christian conduct , so that when grown up they may be the staff of their parents ' old age , and the glory of their posterity ; and to force them to study this or that science I do not think wise , though it may be no harm to persuade them ; and when there is no need to study for the sake of pane lucrando , and it is the student 's good fortune that heaven has given him parents who provide him with it , it would be my advice to them to let him pursue whatever science they may see him most inclined to ; and though that of poetry is less useful than pleasurable , it is not one of those that bring discredit upon the possessor . Poetry , gentle sir , is , as I take it , like a tender young maiden of supreme beauty , to array , bedeck , and adorn whom is the task of several other maidens , who are all the rest of the sciences ; and she must avail herself of the help of all , and all derive their lustre from her . But this maiden will not bear to be handled , nor dragged through the streets , nor exposed either at the corners of the market-places , or in the closets of palaces . She is the product of an Alchemy of such virtue that he who is able to practise it , will turn her into pure gold of inestimable worth . He that possesses her must keep her within bounds , not permitting her to break out in ribald satires or soulless sonnets . She must on no account be offered for sale , unless , indeed , it be in heroic poems , moving tragedies , or sprightly and ingenious comedies . She must not be touched by the buffoons , nor by the ignorant vulgar , incapable of comprehending or appreciating her hidden treasures . And do not suppose , senor , that I apply the term vulgar here merely to plebeians and the lower orders ; for everyone who is ignorant , be he lord or prince , may and should be included among the vulgar . He , then , who shall embrace and cultivate poetry under the conditions I have named , shall become famous , and his name honoured throughout all the civilised nations of the earth . And with regard to what you say , senor , of your son having no great opinion of Spanish poetry , I am inclined to think that he is not quite right there , and for this reason : the great poet Homer did not write in Latin , because he was a Greek , nor did Virgil write in Greek , because he was a Latin ; in short , all the ancient poets wrote in the language they imbibed with their mother 's milk , and never went in quest of foreign ones to express their sublime conceptions ; and that being so , the usage should in justice extend to all nations , and the German poet should not be undervalued because he writes in his own language , nor the Castilian , nor even the Biscayan , for writing in his . But your son , senor , I suspect , is not prejudiced against Spanish poetry , but against those poets who are mere Spanish verse writers , without any knowledge of other languages or sciences to adorn and give life and vigour to their natural inspiration ; and yet even in this he may be wrong ; for , according to a true belief , a poet is born one ; that is to say , the poet by nature comes forth a poet from his mother 's womb ; and following the bent that heaven has bestowed upon him , without the aid of study or art , he produces things that show how truly he spoke who said , ` Est Deus in nobis , ' etc. . At the same time , I say that the poet by nature who calls in art to his aid will be a far better poet , and will surpass him who tries to be one relying upon his knowledge of art alone . The reason is , that art does not surpass nature , but only brings it to perfection ; and thus , nature combined with art , and art with nature , will produce a perfect poet . To bring my argument to a close , I would say then , gentle sir , let your son go on as his star leads him , for being so studious as he seems to be , and having already successfully surmounted the first step of the sciences , which is that of the languages , with their help he will by his own exertions reach the summit of polite literature , which so well becomes an independent gentleman , and adorns , honours , and distinguishes him , as much as the mitre does the bishop , or the gown the learned counsellor . If your son write satires reflecting on the honour of others , chide and correct him , and tear them up ; but if he compose discourses in which he rebukes vice in general , in the style of Horace , and with elegance like his , commend him ; for it is legitimate for a poet to write against envy and lash the envious in his verse , and the other vices too , provided he does not single out individuals ; there are , however , poets who , for the sake of saying something spiteful , would run the risk of being banished to the coast of Pontus . If the poet be pure in his morals , he will be pure in his verses too ; the pen is the tongue of the mind , and as the thought engendered there , so will be the things that it writes down . And when kings and princes observe this marvellous science of poetry in wise , virtuous , and thoughtful subjects , they honour , value , exalt them , and even crown them with the leaves of that tree which the thunderbolt strikes not , as if to show that they whose brows are honoured and adorned with such a crown are not to be assailed by anyone .

But for all that , I would have you take notice that I am neither so mad nor so foolish as I must have seemed to you . A gallant knight shows to advantage bringing his lance to bear adroitly upon a fierce bull under the eyes of his sovereign , in the midst of a spacious plaza ; a knight shows to advantage arrayed in glittering armour , pacing the lists before the ladies in some joyous tournament , and all those knights show to advantage that entertain , divert , and , if we may say so , honour the courts of their princes by warlike exercises , or what resemble them ; but to greater advantage than all these does a knight-errant show when he traverses deserts , solitudes , cross-roads , forests , and mountains , in quest of perilous adventures , bent on bringing them to a happy and successful issue , all to win a glorious and lasting renown . To greater advantage , I maintain , does the knight-errant show bringing aid to some widow in some lonely waste , than the court knight dallying with some city damsel . All knights have their own special parts to play ; let the courtier devote himself to the ladies , let him add lustre to his sovereign 's court by his liveries , let him entertain poor gentlemen with the sumptuous fare of his table , let him arrange joustings , marshal tournaments , and prove himself noble , generous , and magnificent , and above all a good Christian , and so doing he will fulfil the duties that are especially his ; but let the knight-errant explore the corners of the earth and penetrate the most intricate labyrinths , at each step let him attempt impossibilities , on desolate heaths let him endure the burning rays of the midsummer sun , and the bitter inclemency of the winter winds and frosts ; let no lions daunt him , no monsters terrify him , no dragons make him quail ; for to seek these , to attack those , and to vanquish all , are in truth his main duties . I , then , as it has fallen to my lot to be a member of knight-errantry , can not avoid attempting all that to me seems to come within the sphere of my duties ; thus it was my bounden duty to attack those lions that I just now attacked , although I knew it to be the height of rashness ; for I know well what valour is , that it is a virtue that occupies a place between two vicious extremes , cowardice and temerity ; but it will be a lesser evil for him who is valiant to rise till he reaches the point of rashness , than to sink until he reaches the point of cowardice ; for , as it is easier for the prodigal than for the miser to become generous , so it is easier for a rash man to prove truly valiant than for a coward to rise to true valour ; and believe me , Senor Don Diego , in attempting adventures it is better to lose by a card too many than by a card too few ; for to hear it said , ` such a knight is rash and daring , ' sounds better than ` such a knight is timid and cowardly .

He must know mathematics , for at every turn some occasion for them will present itself to him ; and , putting it aside that he must be adorned with all the virtues , cardinal and theological , to come down to minor particulars , he must , I say , be able to swim as well as Nicholas or Nicolao the Fish could , as the story goes ; he must know how to shoe a horse , and repair his saddle and bridle ; and , to return to higher matters , he must be faithful to God and to his lady ; he must be pure in thought , decorous in words , generous in works , valiant in deeds , patient in suffering , compassionate towards the needy , and , lastly , an upholder of the truth though its defence should cost him his life . Of all these qualities , great and small , is a true knight-errant made up ; judge then , Senor Don Lorenzo , whether it be a contemptible science which the knight who studies and professes it has to learn , and whether it may not compare with the very loftiest that are taught in the schools .

He who has to make a long journey , will , if he is wise , look out for some trusty and pleasant companion to accompany him before he sets out .

I asked Montesinos if he knew them , and he told me he did not , but he thought they must be some enchanted ladies of distinction , for it was only a few days before that they had made their appearance in those meadows ; but I was not to be surprised at that , because there were a great many other ladies there of times past and present , enchanted in various strange shapes , and among them he had recognised Queen Guinevere and her dame Quintanona , she who poured out the wine for Lancelot when he came from Britain .

I wished to follow her , and would have done so had not Montesinos recommended me not to take the trouble as it would be useless , particularly as the time was drawing near when it would be necessary for me to quit the cavern . He told me , moreover , that in course of time he would let me know how he and Belerma , and Durandarte , and all who were there , were to be disenchanted . But of all I saw and observed down there , what gave me most pain was , that while Montesinos was speaking to me , one of the two companions of the hapless Dulcinea approached me on one without my having seen her coming , and with tears in her eyes said to me , in a low , agitated voice , ` My lady Dulcinea del Toboso kisses your worship 's hands , and entreats you to do her the favour of letting her know how you are ; and , being in great need , she also entreats your worship as earnestly as she can to be so good as to lend her half a dozen reals , or as much as you may have about you , on this new dimity petticoat that I have here ; and she promises to repay them very speedily . ' I was amazed and taken aback by such a message , and turning to Senor Montesinos I asked him , ` Is it possible , Senor Montesinos , that persons of distinction under enchantment can be in need ? ' To which he replied , ` Believe me , Senor Don Quixote , that which is called need is to be met with everywhere , and penetrates all quarters and reaches everyone , and does not spare even the enchanted ; and as the lady Dulcinea del Toboso sends to beg those six reals , and the pledge is to all appearance a good one , there is nothing for it but to give them to her , for no doubt she must be in some great strait . ' ' I will take no pledge of her , ' I replied , ` nor yet can I give her what she asks , for all I have is four reals ; which I gave -LRB- they were those which thou , Sancho , gavest me the other day to bestow in alms upon the poor I met along the road -RRB- , and I said , ` Tell your mistress , my dear , that I am grieved to the heart because of her distresses , and wish I was a Fucar to remedy them , and that I would have her know that I can not be , and ought not be , in health while deprived of the happiness of seeing her and enjoying her discreet conversation , and that I implore her as earnestly as I can , to allow herself to be seen and addressed by this her captive servant and forlorn knight . Tell her , too , that when she least expects it she will hear it announced that I have made an oath and vow after the fashion of that which the Marquis of Mantua made to avenge his nephew Baldwin , when he found him at the point of death in the heart of the mountains , which was , not to eat bread off a tablecloth , and other trifling matters which he added , until he had avenged him ; and I will make the same to take no rest , and to roam the seven regions of the earth more thoroughly than the Infante Don Pedro of Portugal ever roamed them , until I have disenchanted her . ' ' All that and more , you owe my lady , ' the damsel 's answer to me , and taking the four reals , instead of making me a curtsey she cut a caper , springing two full yards into the air .

They asked Julius Caesar , the valiant Roman emperor , what was the best death . He answered , that which is unexpected , which comes suddenly and unforeseen ; and though he answered like a pagan , and one without the knowledge of the true God , yet , as far as sparing our feelings is concerned , he was right ; for suppose you are killed in the first engagement or skirmish , whether by a cannon ball or blown up by mine , what matters it ? It is only dying , and all is over ; and according to Terence , a soldier shows better dead in battle , than alive and safe in flight ; and the good soldier wins fame in proportion as he is obedient to his captains and those in command over him . And remember , my son , that it is better for the soldier to smell of gunpowder than of civet , and that if old age should come upon you in this honourable calling , though you may be covered with wounds and crippled and lame , it will not come upon you without honour , and that such as poverty can not lessen ; especially now that provisions are being made for supporting and relieving old and disabled soldiers ; for it is not right to deal with them after the fashion of those who set free and get rid of their black slaves when they are old and useless , and , turning them out of their houses under the pretence of making them free , make them slaves to hunger , from which they can not expect to be released except by death .

This being as it is , it is clear that this ape speaks by the spirit of the devil ; and I am astonished they have not denounced him to the Holy Office , and put him to the question , and forced it out of him by whose virtue it is that he divines ; because it is certain this ape is not an astrologer ; neither his master nor he sets up , or knows how to set up , those figures they call judiciary , which are now so common in Spain that there is not a jade , or page , or old cobbler , that will not undertake to set up a figure as readily as pick up a knave of cards from the ground , bringing to nought the marvellous truth of the science by their lies and ignorance .

In truth and earnest , I assure you gentlemen who now hear me , that to me everything that has taken place here seemed to take place literally , that Melisendra was Melisendra , Don Gaiferos Don Gaiferos , Marsilio Marsilio , and Charlemagne Charlemagne . That was why my anger was roused ; and to be faithful to my calling as a knight-errant I sought to give aid and protection to those who fled , and with this good intention I did what you have seen . If the result has been the opposite of what I intended , it is no fault of mine , but of those wicked beings that persecute me ; but , for all that , I am willing to condemn myself in costs for this error of mine , though it did not proceed from malice ; let Master Pedro see what he wants for the spoiled figures , for I agree to pay it at once in good and current money of Castile .

'' ","i":341198},{"w":"`` Worthy sirs , I entreat you as earnestly as I can not to interrupt an argument I wish to address to you , until you find it displeases or wearies you ; and if that come to pass , on the slightest hint you give me I will put a seal upon my lips and a gag upon my tongue . '' ","i":343046},{"w":"`` I , sirs , am a knight-errant whose calling is that of arms , and whose profession is to protect those who require protection , and give help to such as stand in need of it . Some days ago I became acquainted with your misfortune and the cause which impels you to take up arms again and again to revenge yourselves upon your enemies ; and having many times thought over your business in my mind , I find that , according to the laws of combat , you are mistaken in holding yourselves insulted ; for a private individual can not insult an entire community ; unless it be by defying it collectively as a traitor , because he can not tell who in particular is guilty of the treason for which he defies it . Of this we have an example in Don Diego Ordonez de Lara , who defied the whole town of Zamora , because he did not know that Vellido Dolfos alone had committed the treachery of slaying his king ; and therefore he defied them all , and the vengeance and the reply concerned all ; though , to be sure , Senor Don Diego went rather too far , indeed very much beyond the limits of a defiance ; for he had no occasion to defy the dead , or the waters , or the fishes , or those yet unborn , and all the rest of it as set forth ; but let that pass , for when anger breaks out there 's no father , governor , or bridle to check the tongue . The case being , then , that no one person can insult a kingdom , province , city , state , or entire community , it is clear there is no reason for going out to avenge the defiance of such an insult , inasmuch as it is not one . A fine thing it would be if the people of the clock town were to be at loggerheads every moment with everyone who called them by that name , -- or the Cazoleros , Berengeneros , Ballenatos , Jaboneros , or the bearers of all the other names and titles that are always in the mouth of the boys and common people ! It would be a nice business indeed if all these illustrious cities were to take huff and revenge themselves and go about perpetually making trombones of their swords in every petty quarrel ! No , no ; God forbid ! There are four things for which sensible men and well-ordered States ought to take up arms , draw their swords , and risk their persons , lives , and properties . The first is to defend the Catholic faith ; the second , to defend one 's life , which is in accordance with natural and divine law ; the third , in defence of one 's honour , family , and property ; the fourth , in the service of one 's king in a just war ; and if to these we choose to add a fifth -LRB- which may be included in the second -RRB- , in defence of one 's country . To these five , as it were capital causes , there may be added some others that may be just and reasonable , and make it a duty to take up arms ; but to take them up for trifles and things to laugh at and be amused by rather than offended , looks as though he who did so was altogether wanting in common sense . Moreover , to take an unjust revenge -LRB- and there can not be any just one -RRB- is directly opposed to the sacred law that we acknowledge , wherein we are commanded to do good to our enemies and to love them that hate us ; a command which , though it seems somewhat difficult to obey , is only so to those who have in them less of God than of the world , and more of the flesh than of the spirit ; for Jesus Christ , God and true man , who never lied , and could not and can not lie , said , as our law-giver , that his yoke was easy and his burden light ; he would not , therefore , have laid any command upon us that it was impossible to obey . Thus , sirs , you are bound to keep quiet by human and divine law . '' ","i":343136},{"w":"`` In an evil hour didst thou take to braying , Sancho !

If so , and if that be thy pleasure , I give it to thee now , once and for all , and much good may it do thee , for so long as I see myself rid of such a good-for-nothing squire I 'll be glad to be left a pauper without a rap .

When a knight is involved in some difficulty from which he can not be delivered save by the hand of another knight , though they may be at a distance of two or three thousand leagues or more one from the other , they either take him up on a cloud , or they provide a bark for him to get into , and in less than the twinkling of an eye they carry him where they will and where his help is required ; and so , Sancho , this bark is placed here for the same purpose ; this is as true as that it is now day , and ere this one passes tie Dapple and Rocinante together , and then in God 's hand be it to guide us ; for I would not hold back from embarking , though barefooted friars were to beg me .

'' ","i":357266},{"w":"`` That is true , '' ","i":357332},{"w":"`` and the reason is , that he who is not liable to offence can not give offence to anyone . Women , children , and ecclesiastics , as they can not defend themselves , though they may receive offence can not be insulted , because between the offence and the insult there is , as your excellence very well knows , this difference : the insult comes from one who is capable of offering it , and does so , and maintains it ; the offence may come from any quarter without carrying insult . To take an example : a man is standing unsuspectingly in the street and ten others come up armed and beat him ; he draws his sword and quits himself like a man , but the number of his antagonists makes it impossible for him to effect his purpose and avenge himself ; this man suffers an offence but not an insult . Another example will make the same thing plain : a man is standing with his back turned , another comes up and strikes him , and after striking him takes to flight , without waiting an instant , and the other pursues him but does not overtake him ; he who received the blow received an offence , but not an insult , because an insult must be maintained . If he who struck him , though he did so sneakingly and treacherously , had drawn his sword and stood and faced him , then he who had been struck would have received offence and insult at the same time ; offence because he was struck treacherously , insult because he who struck him maintained what he had done , standing his ground without taking to flight . And so , according to the laws of the accursed duel , I may have received offence , but not insult , for neither women nor children can maintain it , nor can they wound , nor have they any way of standing their ground , and it is just the same with those connected with religion ; for these three sorts of persons are without arms offensive or defensive , and so , though naturally they are bound to defend themselves , they have no right to offend anybody ; and though I said just now I might have received offence , I say now certainly not , for he who can not receive an insult can still less give one ; for which reasons I ought not to feel , nor do I feel , aggrieved at what that good man said to me ; I only wish he had stayed a little longer , that I might have shown him the mistake he makes in supposing and maintaining that there are not and never have been any knights-errant in the world ; had Amadis or any of his countless descendants heard him say as much , I am sure it would not have gone well with his worship .

For your highnesses must know that , going a few days back to kiss her hands and receive her benediction , approbation , and permission for this third sally , I found her altogether a different being from the one I sought ; I found her enchanted and changed from a princess into a peasant , from fair to foul , from an angel into a devil , from fragrant to pestiferous , from refined to clownish , from a dignified lady into a jumping tomboy , and , in a word , from Dulcinea del Toboso into a coarse Sayago wench . '' ","i":359302},{"w":"`` Who ?

Enchanters have persecuted me , enchanters persecute me still , and enchanters will continue to persecute me until they have sunk me and my lofty chivalry in the deep abyss of oblivion ; and they injure and wound me where they know I feel it most . For to deprive a knight-errant of his lady is to deprive him of the eyes he sees with , of the sun that gives him light , of the food whereby he lives . Many a time before have I said it , and I say it now once more , a knight-errant without a lady is like a tree without leaves , a building without a foundation , or a shadow without the body that causes it . '' ","i":359512},{"w":"`` There is a good deal to be said on that point , '' ","i":359783},{"w":"`` God knows whether there be any Dulcinea or not in the world , or whether she is imaginary or not imaginary ; these are things the proof of which must not be pushed to extreme lengths . I have not begotten nor given birth to my lady , though I behold her as she needs must be , a lady who contains in herself all the qualities to make her famous throughout the world , beautiful without blemish , dignified without haughtiness , tender and yet modest , gracious from courtesy and courteous from good breeding , and lastly , of exalted lineage , because beauty shines forth and excels with a higher degree of perfection upon good blood than in the fair of lowly birth . '' ","i":359801},{"w":"`` To that I may reply , '' ","i":360048},{"w":"`` that Dulcinea is the daughter of her own works , and that virtues rectify blood , and that lowly virtue is more to be regarded and esteemed than exalted vice . Dulcinea , besides , has that within her that may raise her to be a crowned and sceptred queen ; for the merit of a fair and virtuous woman is capable of performing greater miracles ; and virtually , though not formally , she has in herself higher fortunes . '' ","i":360060},{"w":"`` Senora , your highness must know that everything or almost everything that happens me transcends the ordinary limits of what happens to other knights-errant ; whether it be that it is directed by the inscrutable will of destiny , or by the malice of some jealous enchanter . Now it is an established fact that all or most famous knights-errant have some special gift , one that of being proof against enchantment , another that of being made of such invulnerable flesh that he can not be wounded , as was the famous Roland , one of the twelve peers of France , of whom it is related that he could not be wounded except in the sole of his left foot , and that it must be with the point of a stout pin and not with any other sort of weapon whatever ; and so , when Bernardo del Carpio slew him at Roncesvalles , finding that he could not wound him with steel , he lifted him up from the ground in his arms and strangled him , calling to mind seasonably the death which Hercules inflicted on Antaeus , the fierce giant that they say was the son of Terra . I would infer from what I have mentioned that perhaps I may have some gift of this kind , not that of being invulnerable , because experience has many times proved to me that I am of tender flesh and not at all impenetrable ; nor that of being proof against enchantment , for I have already seen myself thrust into a cage , in which all the world would not have been able to confine me except by force of enchantments . But as I delivered myself from that one , I am inclined to believe that there is no other that can hurt me ; and so , these enchanters , seeing that they can not exert their vile craft against my person , revenge themselves on what I love most , and seek to rob me of life by maltreating that of Dulcinea in whom I live ; and therefore I am convinced that when my squire carried my message to her , they changed her into a common peasant girl , engaged in such a mean occupation as sifting wheat ; I have already said , however , that that wheat was not red wheat , nor wheat at all , but grains of orient pearl . And as a proof of all this , I must tell your highnesses that , coming to El Toboso a short time back , I was altogether unable to discover the palace of Dulcinea ; and that the next day , though Sancho , my squire , saw her in her own proper shape , which is the fairest in the world , to me she appeared to be a coarse , ill-favoured farm-wench , and by no means a well-spoken one , she who is propriety itself . And so , as I am not and , so far as one can judge , can not be enchanted , she it is that is enchanted , that is smitten , that is altered , changed , and transformed ; in her have my enemies revenged themselves upon me , and for her shall I live in ceaseless tears , until I see her in her pristine state . I have mentioned this lest anybody should mind what Sancho said about Dulcinea 's winnowing or sifting ; for , as they changed her to me , it is no wonder if they changed her to him . Dulcinea is illustrious and well-born , and of one of the gentle families of El Toboso , which are many , ancient , and good . Therein , most assuredly , not small is the share of the peerless Dulcinea , through whom her town will be famous and celebrated in ages to come , as Troy was through Helen , and Spain through La Cava , though with a better title and tradition . For another thing ; I would have your graces understand that Sancho Panza is one of the drollest squires that ever served knight-errant ; sometimes there is a simplicity about him so acute that it is an amusement to try and make out whether he is simple or sharp ; he has mischievous tricks that stamp him rogue , and blundering ways that prove him a booby ; he doubts everything and believes everything ; when I fancy he is on the point of coming down headlong from sheer stupidity , he comes out with something shrewd that sends him up to the skies . After all , I would not exchange him for another squire , though I were given a city to boot , and therefore I am in doubt whether it will be well to send him to the government your highness has bestowed upon him ; though I perceive in him a certain aptitude for the work of governing , so that , with a little trimming of his understanding , he would manage any government as easily as the king does his taxes ; and moreover , we know already ample experience that it does not require much cleverness or much learning to be a governor , for there are a hundred round about us that scarcely know how to read , and govern like gerfalcons . The main point is that they should have good intentions and be desirous of doing right in all things , for they will never be at a loss for persons to advise and direct them in what they have to do , like those knight-governors who , being no lawyers , pronounce sentences with the aid of an assessor . My advice to him will be to take no bribe and surrender no right , and I have some other little matters in reserve , that shall be produced in due season for Sancho 's benefit and the advantage of the island he is to govern .

Thus , God is superior to all because he is the supreme giver , and the offerings of man fall short by an infinite distance of being a full return for the gifts of God ; but gratitude in some degree makes up for this deficiency and shortcoming . I therefore , grateful for the favour that has been extended to me here , and unable to make a return in the same measure , restricted as I am by the narrow limits of my power , offer what I can and what I have to offer in my own way ; and so I declare that for two full days I will maintain in the middle of this highway leading to Saragossa , that these ladies disguised as shepherdesses , who are here present , are the fairest and most courteous maidens in the world , excepting only the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso , sole mistress of my thoughts , be it said without offence to those who hear me , ladies and gentlemen .

I had no hopes to give her , nor treasures to offer her , for mine are given to Dulcinea , and the treasures of knights-errant are like those of the fairies , ' illusory and deceptive ; all I can give her is the place in my memory I keep for her , without prejudice , however , to that which I hold devoted to Dulcinea , whom thou art wronging by thy remissness in whipping thyself and scourging that flesh -- would that I saw it eaten by wolves -- which would rather keep itself for the worms than for the relief of that poor lady .

For the shepherdesses whose lovers we shall be , we can pick names as we would pears ; and as my lady 's name does just as well for a shepherdess 's as for a princess 's , I need not trouble myself to look for one that will suit her better ; to thine , Sancho , thou canst give what name thou wilt .

Alheli and alfaqui are seen to be Arabic , as well by the al at the beginning as by the i they end with . I mention this incidentally , the chance allusion to albogues having reminded me of it ; and it will be of great assistance to us in the perfect practice of this calling that I am something of a poet , as thou knowest , and that besides the bachelor Samson Carrasco is an accomplished one . Of the curate I say nothing ; but I will wager he has some spice of the poet in him , and no doubt Master Nicholas too , for all barbers , or most of them , are guitar players and stringers of verses .

Thou knowest that this Torrellas has a son who is called , or at least was not two hours since , Don Vicente Torrellas . Well , to cut short the tale of my misfortune , I will tell thee in a few words what this youth has brought upon me . He saw me , he paid court to me , I listened to him , and , unknown to my father , I loved him ; for there is no woman , however secluded she may live or close she may be kept , who will not have opportunities and to spare for following her headlong impulses . In a word , he pledged himself to be mine , and I promised to be his , without carrying matters any further . Yesterday I learned that , forgetful of his pledge to me , he was about to marry another , and that he was to go this morning to plight his troth , intelligence which overwhelmed and exasperated me ; my father not being at home I was able to adopt this costume you see , and urging my horse to speed I overtook Don Vicente about a league from this , and without waiting to utter reproaches or hear excuses I fired this musket at him , and these two pistols besides , and to the best of my belief I must have lodged more than two bullets in his body , opening doors to let my honour go free , enveloped in his blood . I left him there in the hands of his servants , who did not dare and were not able to interfere in his defence , and I come to seek from thee a safe-conduct into France , where I have relatives with whom I can live ; and also to implore thee to protect my father , so that Don Vicente 's numerous kinsmen may not venture to wreak their lawless vengeance upon him .

See how Heaven , by ways strange and hidden from our sight , has brought me face to face with my true husband ; and well you know by dear-bought experience that death alone will be able to efface him from my memory . May this plain declaration , then , lead you , as you can do nothing else , to turn your love into rage , your affection into resentment , and so to take my life ; for if I yield it up in the presence of my beloved husband I count it well bestowed ; it may be by my death he will be convinced that I kept my faith to him to the last moment of life . '' ","i":177634},{"w":"`` If , my lord , the beams of that sun that thou holdest eclipsed in thine arms did not dazzle and rob thine eyes of sight thou wouldst have seen by this time that she who kneels at thy feet is , so long as thou wilt have it so , the unhappy and unfortunate Dorothea . I am that lowly peasant girl whom thou in thy goodness or for thy pleasure wouldst raise high enough to call herself thine ; I am she who in the seclusion of innocence led a contented life until at the voice of thy importunity , and thy true and tender passion , as it seemed , she opened the gates of her modesty and surrendered to thee the keys of her liberty ; a gift received by thee but thanklessly , as is clearly shown by my forced retreat to the place where thou dost find me , and by thy appearance under the circumstances in which I see thee . Nevertheless , I would not have thee suppose that I have come here driven by my shame ; it is only grief and sorrow at seeing myself forgotten by thee that have led me . It was thy will to make me thine , and thou didst so follow thy will , that now , even though thou repentest , thou canst not help being mine . Bethink thee , my lord , the unsurpassable affection I bear thee may compensate for the beauty and noble birth for which thou wouldst desert me . Thou canst not be the fair Luscinda 's because thou art mine , nor can she be thine because she is Cardenio 's ; and it will be easier , remember , to bend thy will to love one who adores thee , than to lead one to love thee who abhors thee now . Thou didst address thyself to my simplicity , thou didst lay siege to my virtue , thou wert not ignorant of my station , well dost thou know how I yielded wholly to thy will ; there is no ground or reason for thee to plead deception , and if it be so , as it is , and if thou art a Christian as thou art a gentleman , why dost thou by such subterfuges put off making me as happy at last as thou didst at first ? And if thou wilt not have me for what I am , thy true and lawful wife , at least take and accept me as thy slave , for so long as I am thine I will count myself happy and fortunate . Do not by deserting me let my shame become the talk of the gossips in the streets ; make not the old age of my parents miserable ; for the loyal services they as faithful vassals have ever rendered thine are not deserving of such a return ; and if thou thinkest it will debase thy blood to mingle it with mine , reflect that there is little or no nobility in the world that has not travelled the same road , and that in illustrious lineages it is not the woman 's blood that is of account ; and , moreover , that true nobility consists in virtue , and if thou art wanting in that , refusing me what in justice thou owest me , then even I have higher claims to nobility than thine . To make an end , senor , these are my last words to thee : whether thou wilt , or wilt not , I am thy wife ; witness thy words , which must not and ought not to be false , if thou dost pride thyself on that for want of which thou scornest me ; witness the pledge which thou didst give me , and witness Heaven , which thou thyself didst call to witness the promise thou hadst made me ; and if all this fail , thy own conscience will not fail to lift up its silent voice in the midst of all thy gaiety , and vindicate the truth of what I say and mar thy highest pleasure and enjoyment .

You are now of an age to choose your line of life or at least make choice of a calling that will bring you honour and profit when you are older ; and what I have resolved to do is to divide my property into four parts ; three I will give to you , to each his portion without making any difference , and the other I will retain to live upon and support myself for whatever remainder of life Heaven may be pleased to grant me . But I wish each of you on taking possession of the share that falls to him to follow one of the paths I shall indicate . In this Spain of ours there is a proverb , to my mind very true -- as they all are , being short aphorisms drawn from long practical experience -- and the one I refer to says , ` The church , or the sea , or the king 's house ; ' as much as to say , in plainer language , whoever wants to flourish and become rich , let him follow the church , or go to sea , adopting commerce as his calling , or go into the king 's service in his household , for they say , ` Better a king 's crumb than a lord 's favour . ' I say so because it is my will and pleasure that one of you should follow letters , another trade , and the third serve the king in the wars , for it is a difficult matter to gain admission to his service in his household , and if war does not bring much wealth it confers great distinction and fame . Eight days hence I will give you your full shares in money , without defrauding you of a farthing , as you will see in the end .

But tell me , traitor , when did I by word or sign give a reply to thy prayers that could awaken in thee a shadow of hope of attaining thy base wishes ? When were not thy professions of love sternly and scornfully rejected and rebuked ? When were thy frequent pledges and still more frequent gifts believed or accepted ?

And that thou mayest see that being so relentless to myself I can not possibly be otherwise to thee , I have summoned thee to be a witness of the sacrifice I mean to offer to the injured honour of my honoured husband , wronged by thee with all the assiduity thou wert capable of , and by me too through want of caution in avoiding every occasion , if I have given any , of encouraging and sanctioning thy base designs . Once more I say the suspicion in my mind that some imprudence of mine has engendered these lawless thoughts in thee , is what causes me most distress and what I desire most to punish with my own hands , for were any other instrument of punishment employed my error might become perhaps more widely known ; but before I do so , in my death I mean to inflict death , and take with me one that will fully satisfy my longing for the revenge I hope for and have ; for I shall see , wheresoever it may be that I go , the penalty awarded by inflexible , unswerving justice on him who has placed me in a position so desperate .

Do you bring home money , Sancho , and leave marrying her to my care ; there is Lope Tocho , Juan Tocho 's son , a stout , sturdy young fellow that we know , and I can see he does not look sour at the girl ; and with him , one of our own sort , she will be well married , and we shall have her always under our eyes , and be all one family , parents and children , grandchildren and sons-in-law , and the peace and blessing of God will dwell among us ; so do n't you go marrying her in those courts and grand palaces where they wo n't know what to make of her , or she what to make of herself .

'' ","i":133432},{"w":"`` The day which followed the night of my misfortune did not come so quickly , I imagine , as Don Fernando wished , for when desire has attained its object , the greatest pleasure is to fly from the scene of pleasure . I say so because Don Fernando made all haste to leave me , and by the adroitness of my maid , who was indeed the one who had admitted him , gained the street before daybreak ; but on taking leave of me he told me , though not with as much earnestness and fervour as when he came , that I might rest assured of his faith and of the sanctity and sincerity of his oaths ; and to confirm his words he drew a rich ring off his finger and placed it upon mine . He then took his departure and I was left , I know not whether sorrowful or happy ; all I can say is , I was left agitated and troubled in mind and almost bewildered by what had taken place , and I had not the spirit , or else it did not occur to me , to chide my maid for the treachery she had been guilty of in concealing Don Fernando in my chamber ; for as yet I was unable to make up my mind whether what had befallen me was for good or evil . I told Don Fernando at parting , that as I was now his , he might see me on other nights in the same way , until it should be his pleasure to let the matter become known ; but , except the following night , he came no more , nor for more than a month could I catch a glimpse of him in the street or in church , while I wearied myself with watching for one ; although I knew he was in the town , and almost every day went out hunting , a pastime he was very fond of . I remember well how sad and dreary those days and hours were to me ; I remember well how I began to doubt as they went by , and even to lose confidence in the faith of Don Fernando ; and I remember , too , how my maid heard those words in reproof of her audacity that she had not heard before , and how I was forced to put a constraint on my tears and on the expression of my countenance , not to give my parents cause to ask me why I was so melancholy , and drive me to invent falsehoods in reply . But all this was suddenly brought to an end , for the time came when all such considerations were disregarded , and there was no further question of honour , when my patience gave way and the secret of my heart became known abroad . The reason was , that a few days later it was reported in the town that Don Fernando had been married in a neighbouring city to a maiden of rare beauty , the daughter of parents of distinguished position , though not so rich that her portion would entitle her to look for so brilliant a match ; it was said , too , that her name was Luscinda , and that at the betrothal some strange things had happened . '' ","i":134105},{"w":"`` I am that unhappy being , senora , '' ","i":136698},{"w":"`` whom , as you have said , Luscinda declared to be her husband ; I am the unfortunate Cardenio , whom the wrong-doing of him who has brought you to your present condition has reduced to the state you see me in , bare , ragged , bereft of all human comfort , and what is worse , of reason , for I only possess it when Heaven is pleased for some short space to restore it to me . I , Dorothea , am he who witnessed the wrong done by Don Fernando , and waited to hear the ` Yes ' uttered by which Luscinda owned herself his betrothed : I am he who had not courage enough to see how her fainting fit ended , or what came of the paper that was found in her bosom , because my heart had not the fortitude to endure so many strokes of ill-fortune at once ; and so losing patience I quitted the house , and leaving a letter with my host , which I entreated him to place in Luscinda 's hands , I betook myself to these solitudes , resolved to end here the life I hated as if it were my mortal enemy . But fate would not rid me of it , contenting itself with robbing me of my reason , perhaps to preserve me for the good fortune I have had in meeting you ; for if that which you have just told us be true , as I believe it to be , it may be that Heaven has yet in store for both of us a happier termination to our misfortunes than we look for ; because seeing that Luscinda can not marry Don Fernando , being mine , as she has herself so openly declared , and that Don Fernando can not marry her as he is yours , we may reasonably hope that Heaven will restore to us what is ours , as it is still in existence and not yet alienated or destroyed . And as we have this consolation springing from no very visionary hope or wild fancy , I entreat you , senora , to form new resolutions in your better mind , as I mean to do in mine , preparing yourself to look forward to happier fortunes ; for I swear to you by the faith of a gentleman and a Christian not to desert you until I see you in possession of Don Fernando , and if I can not by words induce him to recognise his obligation to you , in that case to avail myself of the right which my rank as a gentleman gives me , and with just cause challenge him on account of the injury he has done you , not regarding my own wrongs , which I shall leave to Heaven to avenge , while I on earth devote myself to yours .

A little light reaches it through some chinks or crevices , communicating with it and open to the surface of the earth . This recess or space I perceived when I was already growing weary and disgusted at finding myself hanging suspended by the rope , travelling downwards into that dark region without any certainty or knowledge of where I was going , so I resolved to enter it and rest myself for a while . I called out , telling you not to let out more rope until I bade you , but you can not have heard me . I then gathered in the rope you were sending me , and making a coil or pile of it I seated myself upon it , ruminating and considering what I was to do to lower myself to the bottom , having no one to hold me up ; and as I was thus deep in thought and perplexity , suddenly and without provocation a profound sleep fell upon me , and when I least expected it , I know not how , I awoke and found myself in the midst of the most beautiful , delightful meadow that nature could produce or the most lively human imagination conceive . I opened my eyes , I rubbed them , and found I was not asleep but thoroughly awake . Nevertheless , I felt my head and breast to satisfy myself whether it was I myself who was there or some empty delusive phantom ; but touch , feeling , the collected thoughts that passed through my mind , all convinced me that I was the same then and there that I am this moment . Next there presented itself to my sight a stately royal palace or castle , with walls that seemed built of clear transparent crystal ; and through two great doors that opened wide therein , I saw coming forth and advancing towards me a venerable old man , clad in a long gown of mulberry-coloured serge that trailed upon the ground . On his shoulders and breast he had a green satin collegiate hood , and covering his head a black Milanese bonnet , and his snow-white beard fell below his girdle . He carried no arms whatever , nothing but a rosary of beads bigger than fair-sized filberts , each tenth bead being like a moderate ostrich egg ; his bearing , his gait , his dignity and imposing presence held me spellbound and wondering . He approached me , and the first thing he did was to embrace me closely , and then he said to me , ` For a long time now , O valiant knight Don Quixote of La Mancha , we who are here enchanted in these solitudes have been hoping to see thee , that thou mayest make known to the world what is shut up and concealed in this deep cave , called the cave of Montesinos , which thou hast entered , an achievement reserved for thy invincible heart and stupendous courage alone to attempt . Come with me , illustrious sir , and I will show thee the marvels hidden within this transparent castle , whereof I am the alcaide and perpetual warden ; for I am Montesinos himself , from whom the cave takes its name . ' '' ","i":325403},{"w":"`` As he said this , the wretched Durandarte cried out in a loud voice : O cousin Montesinos ! ' T was my last request of thee , When my soul hath left the body , And that lying dead I be , With thy poniard or thy dagger Cut the heart from out my breast , And bear it to Belerma . This was my last request . '' ","i":326616},{"w":"`` I can not convince or persuade myself that everything that is written in the preceding chapter could have precisely happened to the valiant Don Quixote ; and for this reason , that all the adventures that have occurred up to the present have been possible and probable ; but as for this one of the cave , I see no way of accepting it as true , as it passes all reasonable bounds . For me to believe that Don Quixote could lie , he being the most truthful gentleman and the noblest knight of his time , is impossible ; he would not have told a lie though he were shot to death with arrows . On the other hand , I reflect that he related and told the story with all the circumstances detailed , and that he could not in so short a space have fabricated such a vast complication of absurdities ; if , then , this adventure seems apocryphal , it is no fault of mine ; and so , without affirming its falsehood or its truth , I write it down . Decide for thyself in thy wisdom , reader ; for I am not bound , nor is it in my power , to do more ; though certain it is they say that at the time of his death he retracted , and said he had invented it , thinking it matched and tallied with the adventures he had read of in his histories .

She was the widow of King Archipiela , her lord and husband , and of their marriage they had issue the Princess Antonomasia , heiress of the kingdom ; which Princess Antonomasia was reared and brought up under my care and direction , I being the oldest and highest in rank of her mother 's duennas . Time passed , and the young Antonomasia reached the age of fourteen , and such a perfection of beauty , that nature could not raise it higher . Then , it must not be supposed her intelligence was childish ; she was as intelligent as she was fair , and she was fairer than all the world ; and is so still , unless the envious fates and hard-hearted sisters three have cut for her the thread of life . But that they have not , for Heaven will not suffer so great a wrong to Earth , as it would be to pluck unripe the grapes of the fairest vineyard on its surface . Of this beauty , to which my poor feeble tongue has failed to do justice , countless princes , not only of that country , but of others , were enamoured , and among them a private gentleman , who was at the court , dared to raise his thoughts to the heaven of so great beauty , trusting to his youth , his gallant bearing , his numerous accomplishments and graces , and his quickness and readiness of wit ; for I may tell your highnesses , if I am not wearying you , that he played the guitar so as to make it speak , and he was , besides , a poet and a great dancer , and he could make birdcages so well , that by making them alone he might have gained a livelihood , had he found himself reduced to utter poverty ; and gifts and graces of this kind are enough to bring down a mountain , not to say a tender young girl . But all his gallantry , wit , and gaiety , all his graces and accomplishments , would have been of little or no avail towards gaining the fortress of my pupil , had not the impudent thief taken the precaution of gaining me over first . First , the villain and heartless vagabond sought to win my good-will and purchase my compliance , so as to get me , like a treacherous warder , to deliver up to him the keys of the fortress I had in charge . In a word , he gained an influence over my mind , and overcame my resolutions with I know not what trinkets and jewels he gave me ; but it was some verses I heard him singing one night from a grating that opened on the street where he lived , that , more than anything else , made me give way and led to my fall ; and if I remember rightly they ran thus : From that sweet enemy of mine My bleeding heart hath had its wound ; And to increase the pain I 'm bound To suffer and to make no sign . The lines seemed pearls to me and his voice sweet as syrup ; and afterwards , I may say ever since then , looking at the misfortune into which I have fallen , I have thought that poets , as Plato advised , ought to be banished from all well-ordered States ; at least the amatory ones , for they write verses , not like those of ` The Marquis of Mantua , ' that delight and draw tears from the women and children , but sharp-pointed conceits that pierce the heart like soft thorns , and like the lightning strike it , leaving the raiment uninjured . Another time he sang : Come Death , so subtly veiled that I Thy coming know not , how or when , Lest it should give me life again To find how sweet it is to die . -- and other verses and burdens of the same sort , such as enchant when sung and fascinate when written . And then , when they condescend to compose a sort of verse that was at that time in vogue in Kandy , which they call seguidillas ! Then it is that hearts leap and laughter breaks forth , and the body grows restless and all the senses turn quicksilver . And so I say , sirs , that these troubadours richly deserve to be banished to the isles of the lizards . Though it is not they that are in fault , but the simpletons that extol them , and the fools that believe in them ; and had I been the faithful duenna I should have been , his stale conceits would have never moved me , nor should I have been taken in by such phrases as ` in death I live , ' ' in ice I burn , ' ' in flames I shiver , ' ` hopeless I hope , ' ' I go and stay , ' and paradoxes of that sort which their writings are full of . And then when they promise the Phoenix of Arabia , the crown of Ariadne , the horses of the Sun , the pearls of the South , the gold of Tibar , and the balsam of Panchaia ! Then it is they give a loose to their pens , for it costs them little to make promises they have no intention or power of fulfilling . But where am I wandering to ? Woe is me , unfortunate being ! What madness or folly leads me to speak of the faults of others , when there is so much to be said about my own ? Again , woe is me , hapless that I am ! it was not verses that conquered me , but my own simplicity ; it was not music made me yield , but my own imprudence ; my own great ignorance and little caution opened the way and cleared the path for Don Clavijo 's advances , for that was the name of the gentleman I have referred to ; and so , with my help as go-between , he found his way many a time into the chamber of the deceived Antonomasia -LRB- deceived not by him but by me -RRB- under the title of a lawful husband ; for , sinner though I was , would not have allowed him to approach the edge of her shoe-sole without being her husband . No , no , not that ; marriage must come first in any business of this sort that I take in hand . But there was one hitch in this case , which was that of inequality of rank , Don Clavijo being a private gentleman , and the Princess Antonomasia , as I said , heiress to the kingdom . The entanglement remained for some time a secret , kept hidden by my cunning precautions , until I perceived that a certain expansion of waist in Antonomasia must before long disclose it , the dread of which made us all there take counsel together , and it was agreed that before the mischief came to light , Don Clavijo should demand Antonomasia as his wife before the Vicar , in virtue of an agreement to marry him made by the princess , and drafted by my wit in such binding terms that the might of Samson could not have broken it . The necessary steps were taken ; the Vicar saw the agreement , and took the lady 's confession ; she confessed everything in full , and he ordered her into the custody of a very worthy alguacil of the court .

What was , was ; and may the good that is to come be for all , and the evil for him who goes to look for it -- your worship must know that the beginning the old folk used to put to their tales was not just as each one pleased ; it was a maxim of Cato Zonzorino the Roman , that says ` the evil for him that goes to look for it , ' and it comes as pat to the purpose now as ring to finger , to show that your worship should keep quiet and not go looking for evil in any quarter , and that we should go back by some other road , since nobody forces us to follow this in which so many terrors affright us . '' ","i":85677},{"w":"`` I say then , '' ","i":85886},{"w":"`` that in a village of Estremadura there was a goat-shepherd -- that is to say , one who tended goats -- which shepherd or goatherd , as my story goes , was called Lope Ruiz , and this Lope Ruiz was in love with a shepherdess called Torralva , which shepherdess called Torralva was the daughter of a rich grazier , and this rich grazier - '' ","i":85895},{"w":"`` If that is the way thou tellest thy tale , Sancho , '' ","i":85963},{"w":"`` Tales are always told in my country in the very way I am telling this , '' ","i":86019},{"w":"`` and I can not tell it in any other , nor is it right of your worship to ask me to make new customs .

And so in course of time , the devil , who never sleeps and puts everything in confusion , contrived that the love the shepherd bore the shepherdess turned into hatred and ill-will , and the reason , according to evil tongues , was some little jealousy she caused him that crossed the line and trespassed on forbidden ground ; and so much did the shepherd hate her from that time forward that , in order to escape from her , he determined to quit the country and go where he should never set eyes on her again . Torralva , when she found herself spurned by Lope , was immediately smitten with love for him , though she had never loved him before . '' ","i":86180},{"w":"`` It came to pass , '' ","i":86378},{"w":"`` that the shepherd carried out his intention , and driving his goats before him took his way across the plains of Estremadura to pass over into the Kingdom of Portugal . Torralva , who knew of it , went after him , and on foot and barefoot followed him at a distance , with a pilgrim 's staff in her hand and a scrip round her neck , in which she carried , it is said , a bit of looking-glass and a piece of a comb and some little pot or other of paint for her face ; but let her carry what she did , I am not going to trouble myself to prove it ; all I say is , that the shepherd , they say , came with his flock to cross over the river Guadiana , which was at that time swollen and almost overflowing its banks , and at the spot he came to there was neither ferry nor boat nor anyone to carry him or his flock to the other side , at which he was much vexed , for he perceived that Torralva was approaching and would give him great annoyance with her tears and entreaties ; however , he went looking about so closely that he discovered a fisherman who had alongside of him a boat so small that it could only hold one person and one goat ; but for all that he spoke to him and agreed with him to carry himself and his three hundred goats across . The fisherman got into the boat and carried one goat over ; he came back and carried another over ; he came back again , and again brought over another -- let your worship keep count of the goats the fisherman is taking across , for if one escapes the memory there will be an end of the story , and it will be impossible to tell another word of it . To proceed , I must tell you the landing place on the other side was miry and slippery , and the fisherman lost a great deal of time in going and coming ; still he returned for another goat , and another , and another . '' ","i":86388},{"w":"`` How many have gone across so far ?

I can tell you one day she posted herself on the top of the belfry of the village to call some labourers of theirs that were in a ploughed field of her father 's , and though they were better than half a league off they heard her as well as if they were at the foot of the tower ; and the best of her is that she is not a bit prudish , for she has plenty of affability , and jokes with everybody , and has a grin and a jest for everything . So , Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance , I say you not only may and ought to do mad freaks for her sake , but you have a good right to give way to despair and hang yourself ; and no one who knows of it but will say you did well , though the devil should take you ; and I wish I were on my road already , simply to see her , for it is many a day since I saw her , and she must be altered by this time , for going about the fields always , and the sun and the air spoil women 's looks greatly .

From which it is to be gathered that those who do not eat , or drink , or sleep , or do any of the natural acts I am speaking of-that such persons are enchanted ; but not those that have the desire your worship has , and drink when drink is given them , and eat when there is anything to eat , and answer every question that is asked them . '' ","i":233751},{"w":"`` Still for all that , '' ","i":234071},{"w":"`` I will answer for his not running away , '' ","i":234461},{"w":"`` Is it possible , gentle sir , that the nauseous and idle reading of books of chivalry can have had such an effect on your worship as to upset your reason so that you fancy yourself enchanted , and the like , all as far from the truth as falsehood itself is ? How can there be any human understanding that can persuade itself there ever was all that infinity of Amadises in the world , or all that multitude of famous knights , all those emperors of Trebizond , all those Felixmartes of Hircania , all those palfreys , and damsels-errant , and serpents , and monsters , and giants , and marvellous adventures , and enchantments of every kind , and battles , and prodigious encounters , splendid costumes , love-sick princesses , squires made counts , droll dwarfs , love letters , billings and cooings , swashbuckler women , and , in a word , all that nonsense the books of chivalry contain ? For myself , I can only say that when I read them , so long as I do not stop to think that they are all lies and frivolity , they give me a certain amount of pleasure ; but when I come to consider what they are , I fling the very best of them at the wall , and would fling it into the fire if there were one at hand , as richly deserving such punishment as cheats and impostors out of the range of ordinary toleration , and as founders of new sects and modes of life , and teachers that lead the ignorant public to believe and accept as truth all the folly they contain . And such is their audacity , they even dare to unsettle the wits of gentlemen of birth and intelligence , as is shown plainly by the way they have served your worship , when they have brought you to such a pass that you have to be shut up in a cage and carried on an ox-cart as one would carry a lion or a tiger from place to place to make money by showing it . Come , Senor Don Quixote , have some compassion for yourself , return to the bosom of common sense , and make use of the liberal share of it that heaven has been pleased to bestow upon you , employing your abundant gifts of mind in some other reading that may serve to benefit your conscience and add to your honour . And if , still led away by your natural bent , you desire to read books of achievements and of chivalry , read the Book of Judges in the Holy Scriptures , for there you will find grand reality , and deeds as true as they are heroic . Lusitania had a Viriatus , Rome a Caesar , Carthage a Hannibal , Greece an Alexander , Castile a Count Fernan Gonzalez , Valencia a Cid , Andalusia a Gonzalo Fernandez , Estremadura a Diego Garcia de Paredes , Jerez a Garci Perez de Vargas , Toledo a Garcilaso , Seville a Don Manuel de Leon , to read of whose valiant deeds will entertain and instruct the loftiest minds and fill them with delight and wonder . Here , Senor Don Quixote , will be reading worthy of your sound understanding ; from which you will rise learned in history , in love with virtue , strengthened in goodness , improved in manners , brave without rashness , prudent without cowardice ; and all to the honour of God , your own advantage and the glory of La Mancha , whence , I am informed , your worship derives your birth .

For myself I can say that since I have been a knight-errant I have become valiant , polite , generous , well-bred , magnanimous , courteous , dauntless , gentle , patient , and have learned to bear hardships , imprisonments , and enchantments ; and though it be such a short time since I have seen myself shut up in a cage like a madman , I hope by the might of my arm , if heaven aid me and fortune thwart me not , to see myself king of some kingdom where I may be able to show the gratitude and generosity that dwell in my heart ; for by my faith , senor , the poor man is incapacitated from showing the virtue of generosity to anyone , though he may possess it in the highest degree ; and gratitude that consists of disposition only is a dead thing , just as faith without works is dead . For this reason I should be glad were fortune soon to offer me some opportunity of making myself an emperor , so as to show my heart in doing good to my friends , particularly to this poor Sancho Panza , my squire , who is the best fellow in the world ; and I would gladly give him a county I have promised him this ever so long , only that I am afraid he has not the capacity to govern his realm .

That 's what I 'll do , and not stand haggling over trifles , but wash my hands at once of the whole business , and enjoy my rents like a duke , and let things go their own way .

A fortnight might have gone by , so the story goes , since the ass had been missing , when , as the regidor who had lost it was standing in the plaza , another regidor of the same town said to him , ` Pay me for good news , gossip ; your ass has turned up . ' ' That I will , and well , gossip , ' said the other ; ` but tell us , where has he turned up ? ' ' In the forest , ' said the finder ; ' I saw him this morning without pack-saddle or harness of any sort , and so lean that it went to one 's heart to see him . I tried to drive him before me and bring him to you , but he is already so wild and shy that when I went near him he made off into the thickest part of the forest . If you have a mind that we two should go back and look for him , let me put up this she-ass at my house and I 'll be back at once . ' ` You will be doing me a great kindness , ' said the owner of the ass , ` and I 'll try to pay it back in the same coin . ' It is with all these circumstances , and in the very same way I am telling it now , that those who know all about the matter tell the story . Well then , the two regidors set off on foot , arm in arm , for the forest , and coming to the place where they hoped to find the ass they could not find him , nor was he to be seen anywhere about , search as they might . Seeing , then , that there was no sign of him , the regidor who had seen him said to the other , ` Look here , gossip ; a plan has occurred to me , by which , beyond a doubt , we shall manage to discover the animal , even if he is stowed away in the bowels of the earth , not to say the forest . Here it is . I can bray to perfection , and if you can ever so little , the thing 's as good as done . ' ' Ever so little did you say , gossip ? ' said the other ; ` by God , I 'll not give in to anybody , not even to the asses themselves . ' ` We 'll soon see , ' said the second regidor , ` for my plan is that you should go one side of the forest , and I the other , so as to go all round about it ; and every now and then you will bray and I will bray ; and it can not be but that the ass will hear us , and answer us if he is in the forest . ' To which the owner of the ass replied , ` It 's an excellent plan , I declare , gossip , and worthy of your great genius ; ' and the two separating as agreed , it so fell out that they brayed almost at the same moment , and each , deceived by the braying of the other , ran to look , fancying the ass had turned up at last . When they came in sight of one another , said the loser , ` Is it possible , gossip , that it was not my ass that brayed ? ' ` No , it was I , ' said the other . ' Well then , I can tell you , gossip , ' said the ass 's owner , ` that between you and an ass there is not an atom of difference as far as braying goes , for I never in all my life saw or heard anything more natural . ' ' Those praises and compliments belong to you more justly than to me , gossip , ' said the inventor of the plan ; ` for , by the God that made me , you might give a couple of brays odds to the best and most finished brayer in the world ; the tone you have got is deep , your voice is well kept up as to time and pitch , and your finishing notes come thick and fast ; in fact , I own myself beaten , and yield the palm to you , and give in to you in this rare accomplishment . ' ' Well then , ' said the owner , ` I 'll set a higher value on myself for the future , and consider that I know something , as I have an excellence of some sort ; for though I always thought I brayed well , I never supposed I came up to the pitch of perfection you say . ' ' And I say too , ' said the second , ` that there are rare gifts going to loss in the world , and that they are ill bestowed upon those who do n't know how to make use of them . ' ' Ours , ' said the owner of the ass , ` unless it is in cases like this we have now in hand , can not be of any service to us , and even in this God grant they may be of some use . ' So saying they separated , and took to their braying once more , but every instant they were deceiving one another , and coming to meet one another again , until they arranged by way of countersign , so as to know that it was they and not the ass , to give two brays , one after the other . In this way , doubling the brays at every step , they made the complete circuit of the forest , but the lost ass never gave them an answer or even the sign of one . How could the poor ill-starred brute have answered , when , in the thickest part of the forest , they found him devoured by wolves ? As soon as he saw him his owner said , ' I was wondering he did not answer , for if he was n't dead he 'd have brayed when he heard us , or he 'd have been no ass ; but for the sake of having heard you bray to such perfection , gossip , I count the trouble I have taken to look for him well bestowed , even though I have found him dead . ' ' It 's in a good hand , gossip , ' said the other ; ` if the abbot sings well , the acolyte is not much behind him . ' So they returned disconsolate and hoarse to their village , where they told their friends , neighbours , and acquaintances what had befallen them in their search for the ass , each crying up the other 's perfection in braying . The whole story came to be known and spread abroad through the villages of the neighbourhood ; and the devil , who never sleeps , with his love for sowing dissensions and scattering discord everywhere , blowing mischief about and making quarrels out of nothing , contrived to make the people of the other towns fall to braying whenever they saw anyone from our village , as if to throw the braying of our regidors in our teeth . Then the boys took to it , which was the same thing for it as getting into the hands and mouths of all the devils of hell ; and braying spread from one town to another in such a way that the men of the braying town are as easy to be known as blacks are to be known from whites , and the unlucky joke has gone so far that several times the scoffed have come out in arms and in a body to do battle with the scoffers , and neither king nor rook , fear nor shame , can mend matters . To-morrow or the day after , I believe , the men of my town , that is , of the braying town , are going to take the field against another village two leagues away from ours , one of those that persecute us most ; and that we may turn out well prepared I have bought these lances and halberds you have seen .

'' ","i":340155},{"w":"`` It 's not little , '' ","i":340795},{"w":"`` Senor , there 's nothing to stick at in that , for maybe the regidors who brayed then came to be alcaldes of their town afterwards , and so they may go by both titles ; moreover , it has nothing to do with the truth of the story whether the brayers were alcaldes or regidors , provided at any rate they did bray ; for an alcalde is just as likely to bray as a regidor .

Well , then , as this is clear to my mind , I can venture to make him believe things that have neither head nor tail , like that affair of the answer to the letter , and that other of six or eight days ago , which is not yet in history , that is to say , the affair of the enchantment of my lady Dulcinea ; for I made him believe she is enchanted , though there 's no more truth in it than over the hills of Ubeda .

And if your highness does not like to give me the government you promised , God made me without it , and maybe your not giving it to me will be all the better for my conscience , for fool as I am I know the proverb ` to her hurt the ant got wings , ' and it may be that Sancho the squire will get to heaven sooner than Sancho the governor . ' They make as good bread here as in France , ' and ` by night all cats are grey , ' and ' a hard case enough his , who has n't broken his fast at two in the afternoon , ' and ` there 's no stomach a hand 's breadth bigger than another , ' and the same can be filled ` with straw or hay , ' as the saying is , and ` the little birds of the field have God for their purveyor and caterer , ' and ` four yards of Cuenca frieze keep one warmer than four of Segovia broad-cloth , ' and ` when we quit this world and are put underground the prince travels by as narrow a path as the journeyman , ' and ` the Pope 's body does not take up more feet of earth than the sacristan 's , ' for all that the one is higher than the other ; for when we go to our graves we all pack ourselves up and make ourselves small , or rather they pack us up and make us small in spite of us , and then -- good night to us . And I say once more , if your ladyship does not like to give me the island because I 'm a fool , like a wise man I will take care to give myself no trouble about it ; I have heard say that ` behind the cross there 's the devil , ' and that ` all that glitters is not gold , ' and that from among the oxen , and the ploughs , and the yokes , Wamba the husbandman was taken to be made King of Spain , and from among brocades , and pleasures , and riches , Roderick was taken to be devoured by adders , if the verses of the old ballads do n't lie .

And it seems to me that , in governments , to make a beginning is everything ; and maybe , after having been governor a fortnight , I 'll take kindly to the work and know more about it than the field labour I have been brought up to . '' ","i":364261},{"w":"`` All that 's very possible , '' ","i":364723},{"w":"`` and now I 'm willing to believe what my master says about what he saw in the cave of Montesinos , where he says he saw the lady Dulcinea del Toboso in the very same dress and apparel that I said I had seen her in when I enchanted her all to please myself . It must be all exactly the other way , as your ladyship says ; because it is impossible to suppose that out of my poor wit such a cunning trick could be concocted in a moment , nor do I think my master is so mad that by my weak and feeble persuasion he could be made to believe a thing so out of all reason . But , senora , your excellence must not therefore think me ill-disposed , for a dolt like me is not bound to see into the thoughts and plots of those vile enchanters .

But they must go nagging at me at every step -- ` Sancho said it , Sancho did it , Sancho here , Sancho there , ' as if Sancho was nobody at all , and not that same Sancho Panza that 's now going all over the world in books , so Samson Carrasco told me , and he 's at any rate one that 's a bachelor of Salamanca ; and people of that sort ca n't lie , except when the whim seizes them or they have some very good reason for it . So there 's no occasion for anybody to quarrel with me ; and then I have a good character , and , as I have heard my master say , ' a good name is better than great riches ; ' let them only stick me into this government and they 'll see wonders , for one who has been a good squire will be a good governor .

I took a house in a town near Augsburg , and then joined these pilgrims , who are in the habit of coming to Spain in great numbers every year to visit the shrines there , which they look upon as their Indies and a sure and certain source of gain . They travel nearly all over it , and there is no town out of which they do not go full up of meat and drink , as the saying is , and with a real , at least , in money , and they come off at the end of their travels with more than a hundred crowns saved , which , changed into gold , they smuggle out of the kingdom either in the hollow of their staves or in the patches of their pilgrim 's cloaks or by some device of their own , and carry to their own country in spite of the guards at the posts and passes where they are searched . Now my purpose is , Sancho , to carry away the treasure that I left buried , which , as it is outside the town , I shall be able to do without risk , and to write , or cross over from Valencia , to my daughter and wife , who I know are at Algiers , and find some means of bringing them to some French port and thence to Germany , there to await what it may be God 's will to do with us ; for , after all , Sancho , I know well that Ricota my daughter and Francisca Ricota my wife are Catholic Christians , and though I am not so much so , still I am more of a Christian than a Moor , and it is always my prayer to God that he will open the eyes of my understanding and show me how I am to serve him ; but what amazes me and I can not understand is why my wife and daughter should have gone to Barbary rather than to France , where they could live as Christians .

I have answered questions , I have decided causes , and always dying of hunger , for Doctor Pedro Recio of Tirteafuera , the island and governor doctor , would have it so . Enemies attacked us by night and put us in a great quandary , but the people of the island say they came off safe and victorious by the might of my arm ; and may God give them as much health as there 's truth in what they say . In short , during that time I have weighed the cares and responsibilities governing brings with it , and by my reckoning I find my shoulders ca n't bear them , nor are they a load for my loins or arrows for my quiver ; and so , before the government threw me over I preferred to throw the government over ; and yesterday morning I left the island as I found it , with the same streets , houses , and roofs it had when I entered it . I asked no loan of anybody , nor did I try to fill my pocket ; and though I meant to make some useful laws , I made hardly any , as I was afraid they would not be kept ; for in that case it comes to the same thing to make them or not to make them . I quitted the island , as I said , without any escort except my ass ; I fell into a pit , I pushed on through it , until this morning by the light of the sun I saw an outlet , but not so easy a one but that , had not heaven sent me my master Don Quixote , I 'd have stayed there till the end of the world . So now my lord and lady duke and duchess , here is your governor Sancho Panza , who in the bare ten days he has held the government has come by the knowledge that he would not give anything to be governor , not to say of an island , but of the whole world ; and that point being settled , kissing your worships ' feet , and imitating the game of the boys when they say , ` leap thou , and give me one , ' I take a leap out of the government and pass into the service of my master Don Quixote ; for after all , though in it I eat my bread in fear and trembling , at any rate I take my fill ; and for my part , so long as I 'm full , it 's all alike to me whether it 's with carrots or with partridges .
