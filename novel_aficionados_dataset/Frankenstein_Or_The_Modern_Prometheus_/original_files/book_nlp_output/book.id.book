It may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion , but when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends , I wish to be allowed to speak , that I may say what I know of her character . I am well acquainted with the accused . I have lived in the same house with her , at one time for five and at another for nearly two years . During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures . She nursed Madame Frankenstein , my aunt , in her last illness , with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness , in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her , after which she again lived in my uncle 's house , where she was beloved by all the family . She was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother . For my own part , I do not hesitate to say that , notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her , I believe and rely on her perfect innocence . She had no temptation for such an action ; as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests , if she had earnestly desired it , I should have willingly given it to her , so much do I esteem and value her . '' ","i":27859},{"w":"`` I will go , although she is guilty ; and you , Victor , shall accompany me ; I can not go alone . '' ","i":28735},{"w":"`` why do you kneel , if you are innocent ? I am not one of your enemies , I believed you guiltless , notwithstanding every evidence , until I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt . That report , you say , is false ; and be assured , dear Justine , that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment , but your own confession .

Before , I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils ; at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination ; but now misery has come home , and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other 's blood . Yet I am certainly unjust . Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty ; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered , assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures . For the sake of a few jewels , to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend , a child whom she had nursed from its birth , and appeared to love as if it had been her own ! I could not consent to the death of any human being , but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men . But she was innocent . I know , I feel she was innocent ; you are of the same opinion , and that confirms me . Alas ! Victor , when falsehood can look so like the truth , who can assure themselves of certain happiness ? I feel as if I were walking on the edge of a precipice , towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss . William and Justine were assassinated , and the murderer escapes ; he walks about the world free , and perhaps respected . But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes , I would not change places with such a wretch . '' ","i":31346},{"w":"`` My dearest friend , you must calm yourself . These events have affected me , God knows how deeply ; but I am not so wretched as you are . There is an expression of despair , and sometimes of revenge , in your countenance that makes me tremble . Dear Victor , banish these dark passions . Remember the friends around you , who centre all their hopes in you . Have we lost the power of rendering you happy ? Ah ! While we love , while we are true to each other , here in this land of peace and beauty , your native country , we may reap every tranquil blessing -- what can disturb our peace ?
