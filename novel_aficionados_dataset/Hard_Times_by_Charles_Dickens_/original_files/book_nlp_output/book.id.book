You were coming out of the Italian Opera , ma'am , in white satin and jewels , a blaze of splendour , when I had n't a penny to buy a link to light you . ' ","i":20304},{"w":"` - with the wrong side of it . A hard bed the pavement of its Arcade used to make , I assure you . People like you , ma'am , accustomed from infancy to lie on Down feathers , have no idea how hard a paving-stone is , without trying it . No , no , it 's of no use my talking to you about tumblers . I should speak of foreign dancers , and the West End of London , and May Fair , and lords and ladies and honourables . ' ","i":20474},{"w":"` It is true , sir , ' ","i":20801},{"w":"` Yes , sir , ' ","i":20853},{"w":"` Now , I tell you what , my girl . The name of that lady by the teapot , is Mrs. Sparsit . That lady acts as mistress of this house , and she is a highly connected lady . Consequently , if ever you come again into any room in this house , you will make a short stay in it if you do n't behave towards that lady in your most respectful manner . Now , I do n't care a button what you do to me , because I do n't affect to be anybody . So far from having high connections I have no connections at all , and I come of the scum of the earth . But towards that lady , I do care what you do ; and you shall do what is deferential and respectful , or you shall not come here . ' ","i":20992},{"w":"` that this was merely an oversight . Very likely . However , as you are aware , ma'am , I do n't allow of even oversights towards you . ' ","i":21184},{"w":"` Well , ' ","i":21723},{"w":"` I have given you my opinion already , and I should n't do as you do . But , very well , very well . Since you are bent upon it , very well ! ' ","i":21731},{"w":"` what 's the matter with you ? ' ","i":31285},{"w":"` we have never had any difficulty with you , and you have never been one of the unreasonable ones . You do n't expect to be set up in a coach and six , and to be fed on turtle soup and venison , with a gold spoon , as a good many of 'em do ! ' ","i":31368},{"w":"` and therefore I know already that you have not come here to make a complaint . Now , you know , I am certain of that , beforehand . ' ","i":31451},{"w":"` No , sir , sure I ha ' ","i":31482},{"w":"` Very well , ' ","i":31514},{"w":"` You 're a steady Hand , and I was not mistaken . Now , let me hear what it 's all about . As it 's not that , let me hear what it is . What have you got to say ? Out with it , lad ! ' ","i":31522},{"w":"` She took to drinking , left off working , sold the furniture , pawned the clothes , and played old Gooseberry . ' ","i":31922},{"w":"` I were very patient wi ' ","i":31977},{"w":"` From bad to worse , from worse to worsen . She left me . She disgraced herseln everyways , bitter and bad . She coom back , she coom back , she coom back . What could I do t ' ","i":32089},{"w":"` I was acquainted with all this , you know , ' ","i":32445},{"w":"` except the last clause , long ago . It 's a bad job ; that 's what it is . You had better have been satisfied as you were , and not have got married . However , it 's too late to say that . ' ","i":32461},{"w":"` Not e ` en so . I were one-and-twenty myseln ; she were twenty nighbut . ' ","i":32557},{"w":"` Well ? Why do n't you go on ? ' ","i":32647},{"w":"` What are you talking about ? You took her for better for worse . ' ","i":32741},{"w":"` If I do her any hurt , sir , there 's a law to punish me ? ' ","i":33078},{"w":"` and - and - it must be kept up . ' ","i":33254},{"w":"` There is such a law . ' ","i":33456},{"w":"` Perhaps twice the money . ' ","i":33613},{"w":"` about things you do n't understand ; and do n't you call the Institutions of your country a muddle , or you 'll get yourself into a real muddle one of these fine mornings . The institutions of your country are not your piece-work , and the only thing you have got to do , is , to mind your piece-work . You did n't take your wife for fast and for loose ; but for better for worse . If she has turned out worse - why , all we have got to say is , she might have turned out better . ' ","i":33724},{"w":"` Now , I 'll tell you what ! ' ","i":33857},{"w":"` With what I shall call your unhallowed opinions , you have been quite shocking this lady : who , as I have already told you , is a born lady , and who , as I have not already told you , has had her own marriage misfortunes to the tune of tens of thousands of pounds - tens of Thousands of Pounds ! ' ","i":33876},{"w":"` Now , you have always been a steady Hand hitherto ; but my opinion is , and so I tell you plainly , that you are turning into the wrong road . You have been listening to some mischievous stranger or other - they 're always about - and the best thing you can do is , to come out of that . Now you know ; ' ","i":33951},{"w":"` I can see as far into a grindstone as another man ; farther than a good many , perhaps , because I had my nose well kept to it when I was young . I see traces of the turtle soup , and venison , and gold spoon in this . Yes , I do ! ' ","i":34027},{"w":"` By the Lord Harry , I do ! ' ","i":34096},{"w":"` I believe it was you , unless I have had the bad luck to mistake the person in following ? ' ","i":34544},{"w":"` come out . But , he 's late this year , and I have not seen him . You came out instead . Now , if I am obliged to go back without a glimpse of him - I only want a glimpse - well ! I have seen you , and you have seen him , and I must make that do . ' ","i":35054},{"w":"` if she takes it in the fainting way , I 'll have the skin off her nose , at all events ! ' ","i":46030},{"w":"` Good evening , ma'am , good evening . ' ","i":46105},{"w":"` Do n't go to the North Pole , ma'am ! ' ","i":46159},{"w":"` Thank you , sir , ' ","i":46175},{"w":"` Mrs. Sparsit , ma'am , ' ","i":46302},{"w":"` I have no occasion to say to you , that you are not only a lady born and bred , but a devilish sensible woman . ' ","i":46339},{"w":"` Sir , ' ","i":46367},{"w":"` I am going to astonish you . ' ","i":46408},{"w":"` Yes , sir ? ' ","i":46417},{"w":"` to marry Tom Gradgrind 's daughter . ' ","i":46466},{"w":"` Yes , sir , ' ","i":46475},{"w":"` that you may be in all respects very happy . ' ","i":46625},{"w":"` Well , ma'am , ' ","i":46637},{"w":"` I am obliged to you . I hope I shall be . ' ","i":46664},{"w":"` under these circumstances , I imagine it would not be agreeable to a character like yours to remain here , though you would be very welcome here . ' ","i":46750},{"w":"` Oh , dear no , sir , I could on no account think of that ! ' ","i":46780},{"w":"` If it was not , ma'am , you do n't suppose that I should offer it to a lady who has moved in the society you have moved in . Not that I care for such society , you know ! But you do . ' ","i":46995},{"w":"` You 'll have your own private apartments , and you 'll have your coals and your candles , and all the rest of it , and you 'll have your maid to attend upon you , and you 'll have your light porter to protect you , and you 'll be what I take the liberty of considering precious comfortable , ' ","i":47052},{"w":"` Sir , ' ","i":47118},{"w":"` sooner pitch his property into the Atlantic . ' ","i":48686},{"w":"` Thousand thanks , ' ","i":53421},{"w":"` Josiah Bounderby , Esquire , Banker , Coketown . Specially to introduce James Harthouse , Esquire . Thomas Gradgrind . ' ","i":54873},{"w":"` is not the kind of place you have been accustomed to . Therefore , if you will allow me - or whether you will or not , for I am a plain man - I 'll tell you something about it before we go any further . ' ","i":55016},{"w":"` I do n't promise it . First of all , you see our smoke . That 's meat and drink to us . It 's the healthiest thing in the world in all respects , and particularly for the lungs . If you are one of those who want us to consume it , I differ from you . We are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster than we wear 'em out now , for all the humbugging sentiment in Great Britain and Ireland . ' ","i":55084},{"w":"` I am glad to hear it , ' ","i":55215},{"w":"` Now , you have heard a lot of talk about the work in our mills , no doubt . You have ? Very good . I 'll state the fact of it to you . It 's the pleasantest work there is , and it 's the lightest work there is , and it 's the best - paid work there is . More than that , we could n't improve the mills themselves , unless we laid down Turkey carpets on the floors . Which we 're not a-going to do . ' ","i":55227},{"w":"` Lastly , ' ","i":55330},{"w":"` as to our Hands . There 's not a Hand in this town , sir , man , woman , or child , but has one ultimate object in life . That object is , to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon . Now , they 're not a-going - none of 'em - ever to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon . And now you know the place . ' ","i":55337},{"w":"` it suits my disposition to have a full understanding with a man , particularly with a public man , when I make his acquaintance . I have only one thing more to say to you , Mr. Harthouse , before assuring you of the pleasure with which I shall respond , to the utmost of my poor ability , to my friend Tom Gradgrind 's letter of introduction . You are a man of family . Do n't you deceive yourself by supposing for a moment that I am a man of family . I am a bit of dirty riff-raff , and a genuine scrap of tag , rag , and bobtail . ' ","i":55452},{"w":"` So now , ' ","i":55595},{"w":"` we may shake hands on equal terms . I say , equal terms , because although I know what I am , and the exact depth of the gutter I have lifted myself out of , better than any man does , I am as proud as you are . I am just as proud as you are . Having now asserted my independence in a proper manner , I may come to how do you find yourself , and I hope you 're pretty well . ' ","i":55603},{"w":"` Perhaps you know , ' ","i":55721},{"w":"` or perhaps you do n't know , I married Tom Gradgrind 's daughter . If you have nothing better to do than to walk up town with me , I shall be glad to introduce you to Tom Gradgrind 's daughter . ' ","i":55730},{"w":"` This , sir , ' ","i":56130},{"w":"` is my wife , Mrs. Bounderby : Tom Gradgrind 's eldest daughter . Loo , Mr. James Harthouse . Mr. Harthouse has joined your father 's muster-roll . If he is not Tom Gradgrind 's colleague before long , I believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of our neighbouring towns . You observe , Mr. Harthouse , that my wife is my junior . I do n't know what she saw in me to marry me , but she saw something in me , I suppose , or she would n't have married me . She has lots of expensive knowledge , sir , political and otherwise . If you want to cram for anything , I should be troubled to recommend you to a better adviser than Loo Bounderby . ' ","i":56139},{"w":"` upon my honour , no . I will make no such pretence to you . I have seen a little , here and there , up and down ; I have found it all to be very worthless , as everybody has , and as some confess they have , and some do not ; and I am going in for your respected father 's opinions - really because I have no choice of opinions , and may as well back them as anything else . ' ","i":56644},{"w":"` go in ' ","i":57284},{"w":"` When I was your age , young Tom , ' ","i":57498},{"w":"` I was punctual , or I got no dinner ! ' ","i":57512},{"w":"` Well , then , ' ","i":57564},{"w":"` Come , it 's late . Be off ! ' ","i":59903},{"w":"` Well ! ' ","i":59914},{"w":"` I must take my leave of you though . I say . Yours is very good tobacco . But it 's too mild . ' ","i":59926},{"w":"` Oh , my friends , what but this did I tell you ? Oh , my fellow - countrymen , what warning but this did I give you ? And how shows this recreant conduct in a man on whom unequal laws are known to have fallen heavy ? Oh , you Englishmen , I ask you how does this subornation show in one of yourselves , who is thus consenting to his own undoing and to yours , and to your children 's and your children 's children 's ? ' ","i":61868},{"w":"` what 's this I hear ? What have these pests of the earth been doing to you ? Come in , and speak up . ' ","i":63783},{"w":"` Now , ' ","i":63927},{"w":"` speak up ! ' ","i":63934},{"w":"` Now , look here , Harthouse , ' ","i":64095},{"w":"` Now , you 'll think this pretty well , Harthouse , ' ","i":64398},{"w":"` Ah ! ' ","i":64502},{"w":"` how it happens . ' ","i":64535},{"w":"` As for me , any consideration for me has had just nothing at all to do with it , ' ","i":64620},{"w":"` If only Josiah Bounderby of Coketown had been in question , you would have joined and made no bones about it ? ' ","i":64651},{"w":"` Though he knows , ' ","i":64686},{"w":"` that there are a set of rascals and rebels whom transportation is too good for ! Now , Mr. Harthouse , you have been knocking about in the world some time . Did you ever meet with anything like that man out of this blessed country ? ' ","i":64701},{"w":"` Nay , ma'am , ' ","i":64764},{"w":"` In short , ' ","i":65108},{"w":"` it 's because they are so full of virtues that they have turned you adrift . Go through with it while you are about it . Out with it . ' ","i":65117},{"w":"` if you will favour me with your attention for half a minute , I should like to have a word or two with you . You said just now , that you had nothing to tell us about this business . You are quite sure of that before we go any further . ' ","i":65288},{"w":"` Now , what do you complain of ? ' ","i":65492},{"w":"` I ha ' ","i":65506},{"w":"` What , ' ","i":65535},{"w":"` do you people , in a general way , complain of ? ' ","i":65547},{"w":"` Of course , ' ","i":65853},{"w":"` I 'll tell you something towards it , at any rate , ' ","i":65953},{"w":"` because we will , I tell you ! ' ","i":66030},{"w":"` Sir , ' ","i":66040},{"w":"` I told you , the last time you were here with a grievance , that you had better turn about and come out of that . And I also told you , if you remember , that I was up to the gold spoon look - out . ' ","i":66761},{"w":"` Now it 's clear to me , ' ","i":66829},{"w":"` that you are one of those chaps who have always got a grievance . And you go about , sowing it and raising crops . That 's the business of your life , my friend . ' ","i":66842},{"w":"` that even your own Union , the men who know you best , will have nothing to do with you . I never thought those fellows could be right in anything ; but I tell you what ! I so far go along with them for a novelty , that I 'll have nothing to do with you either . ' ","i":66919},{"w":"` and then go elsewhere . ' ","i":67010},{"w":"` Sir , yo know weel , ' ","i":67017},{"w":"` Why , sir , ' ","i":73885},{"w":"` I did n't mean to be cross , Loo , ' ","i":78465},{"w":"` Harthouse ! ' ","i":79197},{"w":"` Then you have n't heard ! ' ","i":79233},{"w":"` I have heard you , and so has this brute . I have heard nothing else . ' ","i":79241},{"w":"` The Bank 's robbed ! ' ","i":79289},{"w":"` Of much ? ' ","i":79324},{"w":"` Why , no ; not of very much . But it might have been . ' ","i":79351},{"w":"` Oh ! as a sum - if you stick to a sum - of not more than a hundred and fifty pound , ' ","i":79374},{"w":"` But it 's not the sum ; it 's the fact . It 's the fact of the Bank being robbed , that 's the important circumstance . I am surprised you do n't see it . ' ","i":79405},{"w":"` Thank ` ee , ' ","i":79527},{"w":"` But I tell you what . It might have been twenty thousand pound . ' ","i":79543},{"w":"` Suppose it might ! By the Lord , you may suppose so . By George ! ' ","i":79566},{"w":"` It might have been twice twenty . There 's no knowing what it would have been , or would n't have been , as it was , but for the fellows ' ","i":79598},{"w":"` Dropped , sir , as if she was shot when I told her ! Never knew her do such a thing before . Does her credit , under the circumstances , in my opinion ! ' ","i":79673},{"w":"` let 's have none of your interruptions . It 's enough to be robbed while you 're snoring because you 're too comfortable , without being put right with your four seven ones . I did n't snore , myself , when I was your age , let me tell you . I had n't victuals enough to snore . And I did n't four seven one . Not if I knew it . ' ","i":79961},{"w":"` A hundred and fifty odd pound , ' ","i":80068},{"w":"` That sum of money , young Tom locked in his safe , not a very strong safe , but that 's no matter now . Everything was left , all right . Some time in the night , while this young fellow snored - Mrs. Sparsit , ma'am , you say you have heard him snore ? ' ","i":80081},{"w":"` Well ! ' ","i":80278},{"w":"` while he was snoring , or choking , or Dutch-clocking , or something or other - being asleep - some fellows , somehow , whether previously concealed in the house or not remains to be seen , got to young Tom 's safe , forced it , and abstracted the contents . Being then disturbed , they made off ; letting themselves out at the main door , and double-locking it again -LRB- it was double-locked , and the key under Mrs. Sparsit 's pillow -RRB- with a false key , which was picked up in the street near the Bank , about twelve o'clock to-day . No alarm takes place , till this chap , Bitzer , turns out this morning , and begins to open and prepare the offices for business . Then , looking at Tom 's safe , he sees the door ajar , and finds the lock forced , and the money gone . ' ","i":80287},{"w":"` and stays behind at the Bank . I wish these fellows had tried to rob me when I was at his time of life . They would have been out of pocket if they had invested eighteenpence in the job ; I can tell 'em that . ' ","i":80476},{"w":"` Suspected ? I should think there was somebody suspected . Egod ! ' ","i":80531},{"w":"` I 'll tell you . It 's not to be mentioned everywhere ; it 's not to be mentioned anywhere : in order that the scoundrels concerned -LRB- there 's a gang of 'em -RRB- may be thrown off their guard . So take this in confidence . Now wait a bit . ' ","i":80603},{"w":"` What should you say to ; ' ","i":80665},{"w":"` to a Hand being in it ? ' ","i":80678},{"w":"` I hope , ' ","i":80687},{"w":"` and that 's the man . ' ","i":80717},{"w":"` I know ! I am used to that . I know all about it . They are the finest people in the world , these fellows are . They have got the gift of the gab , they have . They only want to have their rights explained to them , they do . But I tell you what . Show me a dissatisfied Hand , and I 'll show you a man that 's fit for anything bad , I do n't care what it is . ' ","i":80752},{"w":"` I can read 'em off , like books . Mrs. Sparsit , ma'am , I appeal to you . What warning did I give that fellow , the first time he set foot in the house , when the express object of his visit was to know how he could knock Religion over , and floor the Established Church ? Mrs. Sparsit , in point of high connexions , you are on a level with the aristocracy , - did I say , or did I not say , to that fellow , `` you ca n't hide the truth from me : you are not the kind of fellow I like ; you 'll come to no good '' ? ' ","i":80879},{"w":"` when he shocked your feelings ? ' ","i":81041},{"w":"` Yes , sir , ' ","i":81049},{"w":"` You can recall for yourself , Harthouse , what I said to him when you saw him . I did n't mince the matter with him . I am never mealy with 'em . I KNOW 'em . Very well , sir . Three days after that , he bolted . Went off , nobody knows where : as my mother did in my infancy - only with this difference , that he is a worse subject than my mother , if possible . What did he do before he went ? What do you say ; ' ","i":81158},{"w":"` to his being seen - night after night - watching the Bank ? - to his lurking about there - after dark ? - To its striking Mrs. Sparsit - that he could be lurking for no good - To her calling Bitzer 's attention to him , and their both taking notice of him - And to its appearing on inquiry to-day - that he was also noticed by the neighbours ? ' ","i":81288},{"w":"` I think so . But there are more of 'em in it . There 's an old woman . One never hears of these things till the mischief 's done ; all sorts of defects are found out in the stable door after the horse is stolen ; there 's an old woman turns up now . An old woman who seems to have been flying into town on a broomstick , every now and then . She watches the place a whole day before this fellow begins , and on the night when you saw him , she steals away with him and holds a council with him - I suppose , to make her report on going off duty , and be damned to her . ' ","i":81412},{"w":"` But I have said enough for the present . You 'll have the goodness to keep it quiet , and mention it to no one . It may take time , but we shall have 'em . It 's policy to give 'em line enough , and there 's no objection to that . ' ","i":81588},{"w":"` I can not bear to see you so , sir , ' ","i":82551},{"w":"` I have n't played backgammon , ma'am , ' ","i":82594},{"w":"` since that time . ' ","i":82608},{"w":"` you do n't see a Fire , do you ? ' ","i":82747},{"w":"` Oh dear no , sir , ' ","i":82759},{"w":"` It 's not myself , sir , ' ","i":82798},{"w":"` Really , sir ? ' ","i":82834},{"w":"` Oh , sir ? ' ","i":82870},{"w":"` Why , I have got out of the habit of taking it now , ma'am , ' ","i":82892},{"w":"` The more 's the pity , sir , ' ","i":82914},{"w":"` It will do you good , sir . It will warm your heart . It is the sort of thing you want , and ought to take , sir . ' ","i":82992},{"w":"` Your health , ma'am !

' ","i":85377},{"w":"` If I waited to be taken care of by my wife , ma'am , I believe you know pretty well I should wait till Doomsday , so I 'll trouble you to take charge of the teapot .

By George , you 'll be corrupted in some of your notions here . You are old - fashioned , ma'am . You are behind Tom Gradgrind 's children 's time . ' ","i":85873},{"w":"` Offence ! ' ","i":85941},{"w":"` Have ? ' ","i":86045},{"w":"` I can wait , you know . If Romulus and Remus could wait , Josiah Bounderby can wait . They were better off in their youth than I was , however .

It 's in hand , though ; and young Tom , who rather sticks to business at present - something new for him ; he had n't the schooling I had - is helping . My injunction is , Keep it quiet , and let it seem to blow over . Do what you like under the rose , but do n't give a sign of what you 're about ; or half a hundred of 'em will combine together and get this fellow who has bolted , out of reach for good . Keep it quiet , and the thieves will grow in confidence by little and little , and we shall have 'em .

The moment she could detach herself from that interview with the person of whom you speak , and whom I deeply regret to have been the means of introducing to you , Louisa hurried here , for protection . I myself had not been at home many hours , when I received her - here , in this room . She hurried by the train to town , she ran from town to this house , through a raging storm , and presented herself before me in a state of distraction . Of course , she has remained here ever since . Let me entreat you , for your own sake and for hers , to be more quiet . ' ","i":103719},{"w":"` without making any observation to you that may not be made with propriety to a woman of good family , what I have got to add to that , is that there is something else in which it appears to me you may take refuge , namely , a coach . And the coach in which we came here being at the door , you 'll allow me to hand you down to it , and pack you home to the Bank : where the best course for you to pursue , will be to put your feet into the hottest water you can bear , and take a glass of scalding rum and butter after you get into bed . ' ","i":104003},{"w":"` Now , as you showed me in your face , Tom Gradgrind , that you wanted to speak to me , ' ","i":104163},{"w":"` but I do n't want to be too dear . That , to start with . When I begin to be dear to a man , I generally find that his intention is to come over me . I am not speaking to you politely ; but , as you are aware , I am not polite . If you like politeness , you know where to get it . You have your gentleman-friends , you know , and they 'll serve you with as much of the article as you want . I do n't keep it myself . ' ","i":104347},{"w":"` Perhaps I thought so . But , I say we are all liable to mistakes and I should feel sensible of your delicacy , and grateful for it , if you would spare me these references to Harthouse . I shall not associate him in our conversation with your intimacy and encouragement ; pray do not persist in connecting him with mine . ' ","i":104479},{"w":"` I never mentioned his name ! ' ","i":104544},{"w":"` Well , well ! ' ","i":104555},{"w":"` Bounderby , I see reason to doubt whether we have ever quite understood Louisa . ' ","i":104584},{"w":"` Let me say I , then , ' ","i":104610},{"w":"` I doubt whether I have understood Louisa . I doubt whether I have been quite right in the manner of her education . ' ","i":104630},{"w":"` There you hit it , ' ","i":104655},{"w":"` There I agree with you . You have found it out at last , have you ? Education ! I 'll tell you what education is - To be tumbled out of doors , neck and crop , and put upon the shortest allowance of everything except blows . That 's what I call education . ' ","i":104665},{"w":"` Well , ' ","i":104780},{"w":"` I do n't understand you , yet , ' ","i":104844},{"w":"` and therefore I wo n't make any promises . ' ","i":104861},{"w":"` In the course of a few hours , my dear Bounderby , ' ","i":104872},{"w":"` You 'd like to keep her here for a time ? ' ","i":105112},{"w":"` I - I had intended to recommend , my dear Bounderby , that you should allow Louisa to remain here on a visit , and be attended by Sissy -LRB- I mean of course Cecilia Jupe -RRB- , who understands her , and in whom she trusts . ' ","i":105125},{"w":"` I gather from all this , Tom Gradgrind , ' ","i":105175},{"w":"` that you are of opinion that there 's what people call some incompatibility between Loo Bounderby and myself . ' ","i":105198},{"w":"` I fear there is at present a general incompatibility between Louisa , and - and - and almost all the relations in which I have placed her , ' ","i":105219},{"w":"` You have said your say ; I am going to say mine . I am a Coketown man . I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown . I know the bricks of this town , and I know the works of this town , and I know the chimneys of this town , and I know the smoke of this town , and I know the Hands of this town . I know 'em all pretty well . They 're real . When a man tells me anything about imaginative qualities , I always tell that man , whoever he is , that I know what he means . He means turtle soup and venison , with a gold spoon , and that he wants to be set up with a coach and six . That 's what your daughter wants . Since you are of opinion that she ought to have what she wants , I recommend you to provide it for her . Because , Tom Gradgrind , she will never have it from me . ' ","i":105300},{"w":"` you have said your say , I believe . I heard you out ; hear me out , if you please . Do n't make yourself a spectacle of unfairness as well as inconsistency , because , although I am sorry to see Tom Gradgrind reduced to his present position , I should be doubly sorry to see him brought so low as that . Now , there 's an incompatibility of some sort or another , I am given to understand by you , between your daughter and me . I 'll give you to understand , in reply to that , that there unquestionably is an incompatibility of the first magnitude - to be summed up in this - that your daughter do n't properly know her husband 's merits , and is not impressed with such a sense as would become her , by George ! of the honour of his alliance . That 's plain speaking , I hope . ' ","i":105514},{"w":"` I am glad to hear you say so . Because when Tom Gradgrind , with his new lights , tells me that what I say is unreasonable , I am convinced at once it must be devilish sensible . With your permission I am going on . You know my origin ; and you know that for a good many years of my life I did n't want a shoeing-horn , in consequence of not having a shoe . Yet you may believe or not , as you think proper , that there are ladies - born ladies - belonging to families - Families ! - who next to worship the ground I walk on . ' ","i":105702},{"w":"` is far from being a born lady . That you know , yourself . Not that I care a pinch of candle-snuff about such things , for you are very well aware I do n't ; but that such is the fact , and you , Tom Gradgrind , ca n't change it . Why do I say this ? ' ","i":105842},{"w":"` and refrain from cutting in till your turn comes round . I say this , because highly connected females have been astonished to see the way in which your daughter has conducted herself , and to witness her insensibility . They have wondered how I have suffered it . And I wonder myself now , and I wo n't suffer it . ' ","i":105935},{"w":"` By your visiting proposition , ' ","i":106107},{"w":"` To a softening down of your ideas of the incompatibility ? ' ","i":106168},{"w":"` If you put it in those terms . ' ","i":106184},{"w":"` What made you think of this ? ' ","i":106194},{"w":"` Come ! ' ","i":106290},{"w":"` I do n't want to be told about that . I know what I took her for , as well as you do . Never you mind what I took her for ; that 's my look out . ' ","i":106297},{"w":"` I think differently , ' ","i":106400},{"w":"` I am going to finish this business according to my own opinions . Now , I do n't want to make a quarrel of it with you , Tom Gradgrind . To tell you the truth , I do n't think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a subject . As to your gentleman-friend , he may take himself off , wherever he likes best . If he falls in my way , I shall tell him my mind ; if he do n't fall in my way , I sha n't , for it wo n't be worth my while to do it . As to your daughter , whom I made Loo Bounderby , and might have done better by leaving Loo Gradgrind , if she do n't come home to-morrow , by twelve o'clock at noon , I shall understand that she prefers to stay away , and I shall send her wearing apparel and so forth over here , and you 'll take charge of her for the future . What I shall say to people in general , of the incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law , will be this . I am Josiah Bounderby , and I had my bringing - up ; she 's the daughter of Tom Gradgrind , and she had her bringing - up ; and the two horses would n't pull together . I am pretty well known to be rather an uncommon man , I believe ; and most people will understand fast enough that it must be a woman rather out of the common , also , who , in the long run , would come up to my mark . ' ","i":106409},{"w":"` and whatever I do , I do at once . I should be surprised at Tom Gradgrind 's addressing such a remark to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown , knowing what he knows of him , if I could be surprised by anything Tom Gradgrind did , after his making himself a party to sentimental humbug . I have given you my decision , and I have got no more to say . Good night ! ' ","i":106749},{"w":"` Will you make it known , young lady , where , and who was there ? ' ","i":108488},{"w":"` I went to the house where Stephen Blackpool lodged , on the night of his discharge from his work , and I saw you there . He was there too ; and an old woman who did not speak , and whom I could scarcely see , stood in a dark corner . My brother was with me . ' ","i":108506},{"w":"` Why could n't you say so , young Tom ? ' ","i":108567},{"w":"` I promised my sister I would n't . ' ","i":108582},{"w":"` Much flattered and obliged . ' ","i":108713},{"w":"` Oh , certainly ! ' ","i":108762},{"w":"` If you put the question whether your ridiculous and improbable account was true or not , I am bound to say it 's confirmed . ' ","i":108771},{"w":"` Come ! ' ","i":109204},{"w":"` you know what you have engaged to do . You had better give your mind to that ; not this . ' ","i":109211},{"w":"` But I have known you people before to-day , you 'll observe , and I know you never die for want of talking . Now , I recommend you not so much to mind talking just now , as doing . You have undertaken to do something ; all I remark upon that at present is , do it ! ' ","i":109471},{"w":"` that you yourself have been looked after now and then , not being considered quite free from suspicion in this business , on account of most people being judged according to the company they keep . The post-office has n't been forgotten either . What I 'll tell you is , that no letter to Stephen Blackpool has ever got into it . Therefore , what has become of yours , I leave you to guess . Perhaps you 're mistaken , and never wrote any . ' ","i":109601},{"w":"` he changes his name , does he ! That 's rather unlucky , too , for such an immaculate chap . It 's considered a little suspicious in Courts of Justice , I believe , when an Innocent happens to have many names . ' ","i":109762},{"w":"` All the surer , I suppose , ' ","i":109966},{"w":"` for your refusing to tell where he is ? Eh ? ' ","i":109979},{"w":"` He shall not , through any act of mine , come back wi ' ","i":109992},{"w":"` if he can be laid hold of any sooner , he shall have an earlier opportunity of clearing himself . As to you , I have nothing against you ; what you came and told me turns out to be true , and I have given you the means of proving it to be true , and there 's an end of it . I wish you good night all ! I must be off to look a little further into this . ' ","i":110100},{"w":"` Good night , father ! ' ","i":110223},{"w":"` Yes , dear . ' ","i":112427},{"w":"` How dare you go and poke your officious nose into my family affairs ? ' ","i":113321},{"w":"` My dear Josiah ! ' ","i":113385},{"w":"` What did you let her bring you for ? Could n't you knock her cap off , or her tooth out , or scratch her , or do something or other to her ? ' ","i":113446},{"w":"` My own boy ! She threatened me that if I resisted her , I should be brought by constables , and it was better to come quietly than make that stir in such a ' ","i":113485},{"w":"` I do n't exactly know , ' ","i":114475},{"w":"` how I come to be favoured with the attendance of the present company , but I do n't inquire . When they 're quite satisfied , perhaps they 'll be so good as to disperse ; whether they 're satisfied or not , perhaps they 'll be so good as to disperse . I 'm not bound to deliver a lecture on my family affairs , I have not undertaken to do it , and I 'm not a going to do it . Therefore those who expect any explanation whatever upon that branch of the subject , will be disappointed - particularly Tom Gradgrind , and he ca n't know it too soon . In reference to the Bank robbery , there has been a mistake made , concerning my mother . If there had n't been over-officiousness it would n't have been made , and I hate over-officiousness at all times , whether or no . Good evening !

' ","i":41370},{"w":"` My dear , ' ","i":41502},{"w":"` I must speak with you alone and seriously . Come to me in my room after breakfast to-morrow , will you ?

Or , perhaps , you are not unprepared for the announcement I have it in charge to make ? ' ","i":42846},{"w":"` I can not say that , father , until I hear it . Prepared or unprepared , I wish to hear it all from you . I wish to hear you state it to me , father . ' ","i":42878},{"w":"` What you say , my dear Louisa , is perfectly reasonable . I have undertaken then to let you know that - in short , that Mr. Bounderby has informed me that he has long watched your progress with particular interest and pleasure , and has long hoped that the time might ultimately arrive when he should offer you his hand in marriage . That time , to which he has so long , and certainly with great constancy , looked forward , is now come . Mr. Bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me , and has entreated me to make it known to you , and to express his hope that you will take it into your favourable consideration . ' ","i":42975},{"w":"` Well , my child , ' ","i":43147},{"w":"` I - really - can not take upon myself to say . ' ","i":43157},{"w":"` Father , ' ","i":43171},{"w":"` Why , my dear Louisa , ' ","i":43426},{"w":"` I would advise you -LRB- since you ask me -RRB- to consider this question , as you have been accustomed to consider every other question , simply as one of tangible Fact . The ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such subjects with irrelevant fancies , and other absurdities that have no existence , properly viewed - really no existence - but it is no compliment to you to say , that you know better . Now , what are the Facts of this case ? You are , we will say in round numbers , twenty years of age ; Mr. Bounderby is , we will say in round numbers , fifty . There is some disparity in your respective years , but in your means and positions there is none ; on the contrary , there is a great suitability . Then the question arises , Is this one disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a marriage ? In considering this question , it is not unimportant to take into account the statistics of marriage , so far as they have yet been obtained , in England and Wales . I find , on reference to the figures , that a large proportion of these marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal ages , and that the elder of these contracting parties is , in rather more than three-fourths of these instances , the bridegroom . It is remarkable as showing the wide prevalence of this law , that among the natives of the British possessions in India , also in a considerable part of China , and among the Calmucks of Tartary , the best means of computation yet furnished us by travellers , yield similar results . The disparity I have mentioned , therefore , almost ceases to be disparity , and -LRB- virtually -RRB- all but disappears . ' ","i":43444},{"w":"` I have stated the case , as such cases are usually stated among practical minds ; I have stated it , as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its time . The rest , my dear Louisa , is for you to decide . ' ","i":43973},{"w":"` Are you consulting the chimneys of the Coketown works , Louisa ? ' ","i":44218},{"w":"` There seems to be nothing there but languid and monotonous smoke . Yet when the night comes , Fire bursts out , father ! ' ","i":44232},{"w":"` O indeed ? Still , ' ","i":44408},{"w":"` I need not point out to you , Louisa , that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate . ' ","i":44419},{"w":"` While it lasts , I would wish to do the little I can , and the little I am fit for . What does it matter ? ' ","i":44445},{"w":"` How , matter ? What matter , my dear ? ' ","i":44490},{"w":"` None , father . What does it matter ! ' ","i":44680},{"w":"` My dear Louisa , ' ","i":44829},{"w":"` You correct me justly . I merely wished to discharge my duty . ' ","i":44843},{"w":"` My dear Louisa , ' ","i":45094},{"w":"` you abundantly repay my care . Kiss me , my dear girl . ' ","i":45103},{"w":"` I may assure you now , my favourite child , that I am made happy by the sound decision at which you have arrived . Mr. Bounderby is a very remarkable man ; and what little disparity can be said to exist between you - if any - is more than counterbalanced by the tone your mind has acquired . It has always been my object so to educate you , as that you might , while still in your early youth , be -LRB- if I may so express myself -RRB- almost any age . Kiss me once more , Louisa . Now , let us go and find your mother . ' ","i":45134},{"w":"` Mr. Thomas , ' ","i":90980},{"w":"` What is the matter ? How strange you look ! And good Heaven , ' ","i":94304},{"w":"` have you come here exposed to this storm ? ' ","i":94329},{"w":"` Father , you have trained me from my cradle ? ' ","i":94434},{"w":"` if I see reason to mistrust myself for the past , Louisa , I should also mistrust myself for the present and the future . To speak unreservedly to you , I do . I am far from feeling convinced now , however differently I might have felt only this time yesterday , that I am fit for the trust you repose in me ; that I know how to respond to the appeal you have come home to make to me ; that I have the right instinct - supposing it for the moment to be some quality of that nature - how to help you , and to set you right , my child . ' ","i":97286},{"w":"` Missed your letter , sir ! ' ","i":103367},{"w":"` Bounderby , ' ","i":103412},{"w":"` I speak of a very special letter I have written to you , in reference to Louisa .

' ","i":104740},{"w":"` I do n't see it at all , sir , ' ","i":104763},{"w":"` we will not enter into the question . I assure you I have no desire to be controversial . I seek to repair what is amiss , if I possibly can ; and I hope you will assist me in a good spirit , Bounderby , for I have been very much distressed . ' ","i":104788},{"w":"` I appear to myself to have become better informed as to Louisa 's character , than in previous years . The enlightenment has been painfully forced upon me , and the discovery is not mine . I think there are - Bounderby , you will be surprised to hear me say this - I think there are qualities in Louisa , which - which have been harshly neglected , and - and a little perverted . And - and I would suggest to you , that - that if you would kindly meet me in a timely endeavour to leave her to her better nature for a while - and to encourage it to develop itself by tenderness and consideration - it - it would be the better for the happiness of all of us . Louisa , ' ","i":104898},{"w":"` has always been my favourite child . ' ","i":105049},{"w":"` Bounderby , ' ","i":105479},{"w":"` I hoped , after my entreaty , you would have taken a different tone .
