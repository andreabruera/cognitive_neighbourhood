le morte $lord_king_arthur$ originally spelled le morte darthur middle french for the #death# of $lord_king_arthur$ is reworking by #sir# $thomas_malory$ of existing tales about the legendary $lord_king_arthur$ guinevere lancelot $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and the #knight# of the round table $thomas_malory$ interpreted existing french and english stories about these figures and added original material g the $gareth_of_orkney$ story $thomas_malory$ actual title for the work was the whole #book# of $lord_king_arthur$ and his noble #knight# of the round table the hoole #book# of kyng $lord_king_arthur$ and of his noble knyghtes of the rounde table but after $thomas_malory$ #death# the publisher changed the title to that commonly known today which originally only referred to the final volume of the work le morte $lord_king_arthur$ was first published in by $william_caxton$ and is today one of the best known works of arthurian literature in english until the discovery of the winchester manuscript in the edition was considered the earliest known text of le morte $lord_king_arthur$ and that closest to $thomas_malory$ translation and compilation modern editions are inevitably variable changing spelling grammar and pronouns for the convenience of readers of modern english many modern arthurian writers have used $thomas_malory$ as their principal source the exact identity of the author of le morte $lord_king_arthur$ has long been the subject of speculation owing to the fact that at least six historical figures bore the #name# of #sir# $thomas_malory$ in the late century in the work the author describes himself as knyght presoner thomas malleorre #sir# thomas maleore according to the publisher $william_caxton$ this is taken as supporting evidence for the identification most widely accepted by scholars that the author was the $thomas_malory$ born in the #year# to #sir# john $thomas_malory$ of newbold revel warwickshire england
sir thomas inherited the family estate in but by he was fully engaged in #life# of crime as early as he had been accused of theft but the more serious allegations against him included that of the attempted murder of humphrey stafford duke of buckingham an accusation of at least two rapes and that he had attacked and robbed coombe abbey $thomas_malory$ was first arrested and imprisoned in for the ambush of buckingham but was released early in by march he was back in the marshalsea prison and then in colchester escaping on multiple occasions in he was granted pardon by $lord_king_arthur$ henry vi returning to live at his estate although originally allied to the house of york after his release $thomas_malory$ changed his allegiance to the house of lancaster this led to him being imprisoned yet again in when he led an ill fated plot to overthrow $lord_king_arthur$ edward iv it was during this final stint at newgate prison in london that he is believed to have written le morte $lord_king_arthur$ $thomas_malory$ was released in october when henry vi returned to the throne but died only five months later elizabeth bryan speaks of $thomas_malory$ contribution to arthurian legend in her introduction to le morte $lord_king_arthur$ $thomas_malory$ did not invent the stories in this collection he translated and compiled them $thomas_malory$ in fact translated arthurian stories that already existed in century french prose the so called old french vulgate romances and compiled them together with at least one tale from middle english sources the alliterative morte arthure and the stanzaic morte $lord_king_arthur$ to create this text
malory called the full work the hoole #book# of kyng $lord_king_arthur$ and of his noble knyghtes of the rounde table but $william_caxton$ instead titled it with $thomas_malory$ #name# for the final section of the cycle the middle english of le morte $lord_king_arthur$ is much closer to early modern english than the middle english of geoffrey chaucer canterbury tales if the spelling is modernized it reads almost like elizabethan english the publication of chaucer work by $william_caxton$ was precursor to his publication of $thomas_malory$ le morte $lord_king_arthur$ where the canterbury tales are in middle english $thomas_malory$ extends one #hand# to chaucer and one to spenser by constructing manuscript which is hard to #place# in one category like other english prose in the century le morte $lord_king_arthur$ was highly influenced by french writings but $thomas_malory$ blends these with other english verse and prose forms $william_caxton$ separated $thomas_malory$ eight #book# into #book# subdivided the #book# into total of #chapter# added summary of each #chapter# and added colophon to the entire #book# the first printing of $thomas_malory$ work was made by $william_caxton$ in only two copies of this original printing are known to exist in the collections of the $queen_morgan_le_fay$ library museum in new york and the john rylands library in manchester it proved popular and was reprinted in and with some additions and changes by wynkyn de worde who succeeded $william_caxton$ press three more editions were published before the english civil #war# william copland thomas east and william stansby each of which contained additional changes and errors including the omission of an entire leaf thereafter the #book# went out of fashion until the romantic revival of interest in all things medieval
winchester college headmaster f oakeshott discovered previously unknown manuscript copy of the work in june during the cataloging of the college library newspaper accounts announced that what $william_caxton$ had published in was not exactly what $thomas_malory$ had written oakeshott published the finding of the manuscript in chronicling the initial event and his realization that this indeed was $thomas_malory$ with startling evidence of revision in the $william_caxton$ edition $thomas_malory$ scholar eugã ne vinaver examined the manuscript shortly after its discovery oakeshott was encouraged to produce an edition himself but he ceded the project to vinaver based on his initial study of the manuscript oakeshott concluded in that the copy from which $william_caxton$ printed his edition was already subdivided into #book# and sections vinaver made an exhaustive comparison of the manuscript with $william_caxton$ edition and reached similar conclusions in his publication of the works of #sir# $thomas_malory$ he argued that $thomas_malory$ wrote not single #book# but rather series of arthurian tales each of which is an internally consistent and independent work however william matthews pointed out that $thomas_malory$ later tales make frequent references back to the earlier events suggesting that he had wanted the tales to cohere better but had not sufficiently revised the whole text to achieve this microscopic examination revealed that ink smudges on the winchester manuscript are offsets of newly printed pages set in $william_caxton$ own font which indicates that the winchester manuscript was in $william_caxton$ print shop the manuscript is believed to be closer on the whole to $thomas_malory$ original and does not have the #book# and #chapter# divisions for which $william_caxton$ takes credit in his preface the manuscript has been digitised by japanese team who note that the text is imperfect as the manuscript lacks the first and last quires and few leaves
the most striking feature of the manuscript is the extensive use of red ink most of the events in the #book# take #place# in britain and france at an unspecified #time# the historical events on which the arthurian legend is based took #place# in the late century but the story contains many anachronisms and makes no effort at historical accuracy in some #part# the plot ventures farther afield to rome and sarras and recalls biblical tales from the ancient near east although $thomas_malory$ hearkens back to an age of idealized knighthood jousting #tournament# and grand #castle# to suggest medieval world his stories lack any agricultural #life# or commerce which makes the story feel as if it were an era of its own $thomas_malory$ eight originally nine main #book# are the birth and rise of $lord_king_arthur$ from the marriage of $lord_king_arthur$ $uther_pendragon$ unto $lord_king_arthur$ that reigned after him and did many #battle# fro the maryage of kynge $uther_pendragon$ unto kyng arthure that regned aftir hym and ded many batayles $lord_king_arthur$ #war# against the romans the noble tale between $lord_king_arthur$ and $lucius_the_emperor$ of rome the noble tale betwyxt kynge arthure and $lucius_the_emperor$ the emperour of rome the #adventure# of #sir# lancelot the noble tale of #sir# $launcelot_du_lake$ of the lake the noble tale of #sir# $launcelot_du_lake$ the story of #sir# $gareth_of_orkney$ the tale of #sir# $gareth_of_orkney$ the tale of #sir# $gareth_of_orkney$ of orkeney the legend of tristan and iseult the #book# of #sir# $tristram_de_liones$ de lyones originally split between the fyrste boke of #sir# trystrams de lyones and the secunde boke of #sir# trystrams de lyones the quest for the grail the noble tale of the sangreal the noble tale of the sankegreall
