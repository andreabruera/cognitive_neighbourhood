he devotes another #chapter# volume ii #book# i to an account ofâ and meditation on the #place# in history ofâ the #battle# of waterloo the battlefield which hugo visited in and where he finished writing the novel it opens volume with such change of subject as to seem the beginning of an entirely different #work# the #fact# that this digression occupies such large #part# of the text demands that it be read in the context of the overarching structure discussed above hugo draws his own personal conclusions taking waterloo to be pivot #point# in history but definitely not victory for the forces of reaction waterloo by cutting short the demolition of european thrones by the sword had no other effect than to cause the revolutionary #work# to be continued in another direction the slashers have finished it was the turn of the thinkers the century that waterloo was intended to arrest has pursued its march that sinister victory was vanquished by liberty #one# critic has called this the spiritual gateway to the novel as its chance encounter of thã nardier and colonel $georges_pontmercy$ foreshadows so many of the novel encounters blending chance and necessity confrontation of heroism and villainy even when not turning to other subjects outside his narrative hugo sometimes interrupts the straightforward recitation of events his #voice# and control of the story line unconstrained by #time# and sequence the novel opens with statement about the $bishop$ of digne in and immediately shifts although these details in no #way# essentially concern that which we have to tell only after #chapter# does hugo pick up the opening thread again in the early #day# of the #month# of october to introduce $jean_valjean$
