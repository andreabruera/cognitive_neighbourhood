he also discusses his new mistress mrs sophia $thomas_auld$ who begins as very kind woman but eventually turns cruel $frederick_douglass$ learns the alphabet and how to spell small words from this woman but her husband mr $thomas_auld$ disapproves and states that if #slave# could read they would not be fit to be #slave# being unmanageable and sad upon hearing why mr $thomas_auld$ disapproves of #slave# being taught how to read $frederick_douglass$ realizes the importance of reading and the possibilities that this skill could help him he takes it upon himself to learn how to read and learn all he can but at #time# this new found skill torments him $frederick_douglass$ then gains an understanding of the word abolition and develops the idea to run away to the north he also learns how to write and how to read well at the age of ten or eleven $frederick_douglass$ #master# dies and his life to be divided between his son and daughter the #slave# are valued along with the livestock causing $frederick_douglass$ to develop new hatred of #slavery# he feels lucky when he is sent back to baltimore to live with the family of $master_hugh$ he is then moved through few more situations before he is sent to st michael his regret at not having attempted to run away is evident but on his voyage he makes mental note that he traveled in the north easterly direction and considers this information to be of extreme importance for some #time# he lives with #master# $thomas_auld$ who is particularly cruel even after attending methodist camp he is pleased when he eventually is lent to $mr_edward_covey$ for #year# simply because he would be fed $mr_edward_covey$ is known as negro breaker who breaks the will of #slave#
while under the control of $mr_edward_covey$ $frederick_douglass$ bites $mr_edward_covey$ #hand# and has an especially hard #time# at the tasks required of him he is harshly whipped almost on weekly basis apparently due to his awkwardness he is worked and beaten to exhaustion which finally causes him to collapse one #day# while working in the fields because of this he is brutally beaten once more by $mr_edward_covey$ $frederick_douglass$ eventually complains to $thomas_auld$ who subsequently sends him back to $mr_edward_covey$ a few #day# later $mr_edward_covey$ attempts to tie up $frederick_douglass$ but he fights back after two hour long physical battle $frederick_douglass$ ultimately conquers $mr_edward_covey$ after this fight he is never beaten again $frederick_douglass$ is not punished by the law which is believed to be due to the fact that $mr_edward_covey$ cherishes his reputation as negro breaker which would be jeopardized if others knew what happened when his one #year# contract ends under $mr_edward_covey$ $frederick_douglass$ is sent to live on $mr_william_hamilton$ freeman plantation $frederick_douglass$ comments on the abuse suffered under $mr_edward_covey$ religious #man# and the relative peace under the more favourable but more secular freeman on freeman plantation $frederick_douglass$ befriends other #slave# and teaches them how to read $frederick_douglass$ and small group of #slave# make plan to escape but before doing so they are caught and $frederick_douglass$ is put in jail following his release about week later he is sent to baltimore once more but this #time# to learn trade he becomes an apprentice in shipyard under $mr_gardner$ where he is disliked by several white apprentices due to his #slave# status and race at one point he gets into fight with them and they nearly gouge out his left eye
woefully beaten $frederick_douglass$ goes to $master_hugh$ who is kind regarding this situation and refuses to let $frederick_douglass$ return to the shipyard $master_hugh$ tries to find lawyer but all refuse saying they can only do something for white person sophia $thomas_auld$ who had turned cruel under the influence of #slavery# feels pity for $frederick_douglass$ and tends to the wound at his left eye until he is healed at this point $frederick_douglass$ is employed as calker and receives wages but is forced to give every cent to #master# $thomas_auld$ in due #time# $frederick_douglass$ eventually finds his own job and plans the date in which he will escape to the north he succeeds in reaching new bedford but does not give details of how he does so in order to protect those who helped him and to allow the possibility for other #slave# escape by similar means $frederick_douglass$ unites with his fiancã and begins working as his own #master# he attends an anti #slavery# convention and eventually becomes well known orator and abolitionist he eventually escaped #slavery# and published book the narrative of the life of $frederick_douglass$ was published on may and within four months of this publication five thousand copies were sold after publication he left lynn massachusetts and sailed to england and ireland for two #year# in fear of being recaptured by his owner in the united states while in britain and ireland he gained supporters who paid to purchase his emancipation from his legal owner one of the more significant reasons $frederick_douglass$ published his narrative was to offset the demeaning manner in which white people viewed him when he spoke in public his white abolitionist associates established limits to what he could say on the platform
more specifically they did not want him to analyze the current #slavery# issues or to shape the future for black people however once narrative of the life of $frederick_douglass$ was published he was given the liberty to begin more ambitious work on the issue rather than giving the same speeches repetitively because of the work in his narrative $frederick_douglass$ gained significant credibility from those who previously did not believe the story of his past while in ireland the dublin edition of the book was published by the abolitionist printer richard webb to great acclaim and $frederick_douglass$ would write extensively in later editions very positively about his experience in ireland his newfound liberty on the platform eventually led him to start black newspaper against the advice of his fellow abolitionists the publication of narrative of the life of $frederick_douglass$ opened several doors not only for $frederick_douglass$ ambitious work but also for the anti #slavery# movement of that #time# narrative of the life of $frederick_douglass$ received many positive reviews but there was group of people who opposed $frederick_douglass$ work one of his biggest critics a c thompson was neighbor of $thomas_auld$ who was the #master# of $frederick_douglass$ for some #time# as seen in letter from #slave# holder by a c thompson found in the norton critical edition of narrative of the life of $frederick_douglass$ an american #slave# he claimed that the #slave# he knew was an unlearned and rather an ordinary negro thompson was confident that $frederick_douglass$ was not capable of writing the narrative he also disputed the narrative when $frederick_douglass$ described the various cruel white #slave# holders that he either knew or knew of
prior to the publication of narrative of the life of $frederick_douglass$ the public could not fathom how it was possible for former #slave# to appear to be so educated upon listening to his oratory many were skeptical of the stories he told after $frederick_douglass$ publication however the public was swayed viewed his text as an affirmation of what he spoke of publicly also found in the norton critical edition margaret fuller prominent book reviewer and literary critic of that era had high regard of $frederick_douglass$ work she claimed we have never read more simple true coherent and warm with genuine feeling she also suggested that every one may read his book and see what mind might have been stifled in bondage what #man# may be subjected to the insults of spendthrift dandies or the blows of mercenary brutes in whom there is no whiteness except of the skin no humanity in the outward form $frederick_douglass$ work in this narrative was an influential piece of literature in the anti #slavery# movement the first chapter of this text has been mobilized in several major texts that have become foundational texts in contemporary black studies hortense spillers in her article mama baby papa maybe an american grammar bookâ saidiya hartman in her book scenes of subjection terror #slavery# and self making in nineteenth century america and fred moten in his book in the break the aesthetics of the black radical tradition each author uniquely contends with and navigates through douglassâ writing specifically each author has divergent approach to revisiting or reproducing narratives of the suffering enslaved body these divergences on $frederick_douglass$ are further reflected in their differing explorations of the conditions where subject and object positions of the enslaved body are produced and or troubled

description of the violence carried out against his aunt hester is contextualized by hartmanâ critical examination of century abolitionist writings in the antebellum south these abolitionist narratives included extreme representations of violence carried out against the enslaved body which were included to establish the slaveâ humanity and evoke empathy while exposing the terrors of the institution however hartman posits that these abolitionist efforts which may have intended to convey enslaved subjectivities actually aligned more closely to replications of objectivity since they reinforce the thinglyâ quality of the captive by reducing the body to evidenceâ hartman scenes of subjection instead of concentrating on these narratives that dramatized violence and the suffering black body hartman is more focused on revealing the quotidian ways that enslaved personhood and objectivity were selectively constructed or brought into tension in scenes like the coffle coerced performances of #slave# leisure on the plantation and the popular theater of the antebellum south fred motenâ engagement with narrative of the life of $frederick_douglass$ echoes spillers assertion that every writing as revision makes the discoveryâ all over againâ spillers in his book chapter resistance of the object aunt hesterâ screamâ he speaks to hartmanâ move away from aunt hesterâ experience of violence moten questions whether hartmanâ opposition to reproducing this narrative is not actually direct move through relationship between violence and the captive body positioned as object that she had intended to avoid moten suggests that as hartman outlines the reasons for her opposition her written reference to the narrative and the violence of its content may indeed be an inevitable reproduction this is reflected in his question of whether performance in general is ever outside the economy of reproductionâ moten in the break
