This here Conkey Chickweed , miss , kept a public-house over Battlebridge way , and he had a cellar , where a good many young lords went to see cock-fighting , and badger-drawing , and that ; and a wery intellectual manner the sports was conducted in , for I 've seen 'em off ` en . He war n't one of the family , at that time ; and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twenty-seven guineas in a canvas bag , that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of night , by a tall man with a black patch over his eye , who had concealed himself under the bed , and after committing the robbery , jumped slap out of window : which was only a story high . He was wery quick about it . But Conkey was quick , too ; for he fired a blunderbuss arter him , and roused the neighbourhood . They set up a hue-and-cry , directly , and when they came to look about 'em , found that Conkey had hit the robber ; for there was traces of blood , all the way to some palings a good distance off ; and there they lost 'em . However , he had made off with the blunt ; and , consequently , the name of Mr. Chickweed , licensed witler , appeared in the Gazette among the other bankrupts ; and all manner of benefits and subscriptions , and I do n't know what all , was got up for the poor man , who was in a wery low state of mind about his loss , and went up and down the streets , for three or four days , a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself . One day he came up to the office , all in a hurry , and had a private interview with the magistrate , who , after a deal of talk , rings the bell , and orders Jem Spyers in -LRB- Jem was a active officer -RRB- , and tells him to go and assist Mr. Chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house . `` I see him , Spyers , '' said Chickweed , `` pass my house yesterday morning , '' '' Why did n't you up , and collar him ! '' says Spyers . `` I was so struck all of a heap , that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick , '' says the poor man ; `` but we 're sure to have him ; for between ten and eleven o'clock at night he passed again . '' Spyers no sooner heard this , than he put some clean linen and a comb , in his pocket , in case he should have to stop a day or two ; and away he goes , and sets himself down at one of the public-house windows behind the little red curtain , with his hat on , all ready to bolt out , at a moment 's notice . He was smoking his pipe here , late at night , when all of a sudden Chickweed roars out , `` Here he is ! Stop thief ! Murder ! '' Jem Spyers dashes out ; and there he sees Chickweed , a-tearing down the street full cry . Away goes Spyers ; on goes Chickweed ; round turns the people ; everybody roars out , `` Thieves ! '' and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting , all the time , like mad . Spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner ; shoots round ; sees a little crowd ; dives in ; `` Which is the man ? '' `` D -- me ! '' says Chickweed , `` I 've lost him again ! '' It was a remarkable occurrence , but he war n't to be seen nowhere , so they went back to the public-house . Next morning , Spyers took his old place , and looked out , from behind the curtain , for a tall man with a black patch over his eye , till his own two eyes ached again . At last , he could n't help shutting 'em , to ease 'em a minute ; and the very moment he did so , he hears Chickweed a-roaring out , `` Here he is ! '' Off he starts once more , with Chickweed half-way down the street ahead of him ; and after twice as long a run as the yesterday 's one , the man 's lost again ! This was done , once or twice more , till one-half the neighbours gave out that Mr. Chickweed had been robbed by the devil , who was playing tricks with him arterwards ; and the other half , that poor Mr. Chickweed had gone mad with grief .

' ","i":149063},{"w":"` He 'll eat his head , if he does n't , ' ","i":149104},{"w":"` And he 'd uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it , ' ","i":149140},{"w":"` to return to the subject in which your humanity is so much interested . Will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor child : allowing me to promise that I exhausted every means in my power of discovering him , and that since I have been absent from this country , my first impression that he had imposed upon me , and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob me , has been considerably shaken . ' ","i":149202},{"w":"` Send Mrs. Bedwin here , if you please . ' ","i":149689},{"w":"` Well , that I do , sir , ' ","i":149741},{"w":"` I could have told you that , ' ","i":149776},{"w":"` but put on your glasses , and see if you ca n't find out what you were wanted for , will you ? ' ","i":149789},{"w":"` Then what the devil is to be done ? ' ","i":150329},{"w":"` Not exactly that , ' ","i":150404},{"w":"` but we must proceed gently and with great care . ' ","i":150416},{"w":"` I 'd send them one and all to -- ' ","i":150438},{"w":"` Never mind where , ' ","i":150449},{"w":"` But reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view . ' ","i":150459},{"w":"` You see , ' ","i":150540},{"w":"` placing this poor girl entirely out of the question , and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety , what good should we bring about ? ' ","i":150549},{"w":"` Hanging a few of them at least , in all probability , ' ","i":150584},{"w":"` but no doubt they will bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time , and if we step in to forestall them , it seems to me that we shall be performing a very Quixotic act , in direct opposition to our own interest -- or at least to Oliver 's , which is the same thing . ' ","i":150620},{"w":"` How ? ' ","i":150682},{"w":"` to call in the aid of my friend Grimwig . He is a strange creature , but a shrewd one , and might prove of material assistance to us ; I should say that he was bred a lawyer , and quitted the Bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course , in twenty years , though whether that is recommendation or not , you must determine for yourselves . ' ","i":151142},{"w":"` who may he be ? ' ","i":151257},{"w":"` That lady 's son , and this young lady 's -- very old friend , ' ","i":151264},{"w":"` Good ! ' ","i":151417},{"w":"` And as I see on the faces about me , a disposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in the way to corroborate Oliver 's tale , and had so suddenly left the kingdom , let me stipulate that I shall be asked no questions until such time as I may deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story . Believe me , I make this request with good reason , for I might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realised , and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite numerous enough . Come ! Supper has been announced , and young Oliver , who is all alone in the next room , will have begun to think , by this time , that we have wearied of his company , and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world . ' ","i":151425},{"w":"` No , my love , ' ","i":170180},{"w":"` She has not moved , and will not till we are gone . ' ","i":170195},{"w":"` Those persons are indemnified by me . If you complain of being deprived of your liberty -- you had power and opportunity to retrieve it as you came along , but you deemed it advisable to remain quiet -- I say again , throw yourself for protection on the law . I will appeal to the law too ; but when you have gone too far to recede , do not sue to me for leniency , when the power will have passed into other hands ; and do not say I plunged you down the gulf into which you rushed , yourself . ' ","i":178195},{"w":"` If you wish me to prefer my charges publicly , and consign you to a punishment the extent of which , although I can , with a shudder , foresee , I can not control , once more , I say , for you know the way . If not , and you appeal to my forbearance , and the mercy of those you have deeply injured , seat yourself , without a word , in that chair . It has waited for you two whole days . ' ","i":178330},{"w":"` A word from me , and the alternative has gone for ever . ' ","i":178441},{"w":"` and , as I advocate the dearest interests of others , I have not the right . ' ","i":178475},{"w":"` Is there -- ' ","i":178494},{"w":"` it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy years were bound up with him , and that fair creature of his blood and kindred who rejoined her God in youth , and left me here a solitary , lonely man : it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters 's death-bed when he was yet a boy , on the morning that would -- but Heaven willed otherwise -- have made her my young wife ; it is because my seared heart clung to him , from that time forth , through all his trials and errors , till he died ; it is because old recollections and associations filled my heart , and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of him ; it is because of all these things that I am moved to treat you gently now -- yes , Edward Leeford , even now -- and blush for your unworthiness who bear the name . ' ","i":178642},{"w":"` What has the name to do with it ? ' ","i":178812},{"w":"` Nothing , ' ","i":178855},{"w":"` nothing to you . But it was hers , and even at this distance of time brings back to me , an old man , the glow and thrill which I once felt , only to hear it repeated by a stranger . I am very glad you have changed it -- very -- very . ' ","i":178863},{"w":"` But what do you want with me ? ' ","i":178969},{"w":"` You have a brother , ' ","i":178979},{"w":"` a brother , the whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the street , was , in itself , almost enough to make you accompany me hither , in wonder and alarm . ' ","i":178993},{"w":"` I have no brother , ' ","i":179034},{"w":"` Attend to what I do know , and you may not , ' ","i":179071},{"w":"` I shall interest you by and by . I know that of the wretched marriage , into which family pride , and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition , forced your unhappy father when a mere boy , you were the sole and most unnatural issue . ' ","i":179089},{"w":"` When they had been separated for some time , ' ","i":179340},{"w":"` and your mother , wholly given up to continental frivolities , had utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior , who , with prospects blighted , lingered on at home , he fell among new friends . This circumstance , at least , you know already . ' ","i":179355},{"w":"` Your manner , no less than your actions , assures me that you have never forgotten it , or ceased to think of it with bitterness , ' ","i":179441},{"w":"` I speak of fifteen years ago , when you were not more than eleven years old , and your father but one-and-thirty -- for he was , I repeat , a boy , when his father ordered him to marry . Must I go back to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent , or will you spare it , and disclose to me the truth ? ' ","i":179474},{"w":"` These new friends , then , ' ","i":179568},{"w":"` were a naval officer retired from active service , whose wife had died some half-a-year before , and left him with two children -- there had been more , but , of all their family , happily but two survived . They were both daughters ; one a beautiful creature of nineteen , and the other a mere child of two or three years old . ' ","i":179580},{"w":"` in a part of the country to which your father in his wandering had repaired , and where he had taken up his abode . Acquaintance , intimacy , friendship , fast followed on each other . Your father was gifted as few men are . He had his sister 's soul and person . As the old officer knew him more and more , he grew to love him . I would that it had ended there . His daughter did the same . ' ","i":179675},{"w":"` and such tales usually are ; if it were one of unmixed joy and happiness , it would be very brief . At length one of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been sacrificed , as others are often -- it is no uncommon case -- died , and to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning , left him his panacea for all griefs -- Money . It was necessary that he should immediately repair to Rome , whither this man had sped for health , and where he had died , leaving his affairs in great confusion . He went ; was seized with mortal illness there ; was followed , the moment the intelligence reached Paris , by your mother who carried you with her ; he died the day after her arrival , leaving no will -- no will -- so that the whole property fell to her and you . ' ","i":179863},{"w":"` Before he went abroad , and as he passed through London on his way , ' ","i":180087},{"w":"` he came to me . ' ","i":180120},{"w":"` I never heard of that , ' ","i":180127},{"w":"` I went , ' ","i":180368},{"w":"` I went , when all was over , to the scene of his -- I will use the term the world would freely use , for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him -- of his guilty love , resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child should find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her . The family had left that part a week before ; they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding , discharged them , and left the place by night . Why , or whither , none can tell . ' ","i":180382},{"w":"` When your brother : a feeble , ragged , neglected child : was cast in my way by a stronger hand than chance , and rescued by me from a life of vice and infamy -- ' ","i":180522},{"w":"` What ? ' ","i":180560},{"w":"` I told you I should interest you before long . I say by me -- I see that your cunning associate suppressed my name , although for ought he knew , it would be quite strange to your ears . When he was rescued by me , then , and lay recovering from sickness in my house , his strong resemblance to this picture I have spoken of , struck me with astonishment . Even when I first saw him in all his dirt and misery , there was a lingering expression in his face that came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream . I need not tell you he was snared away before I knew his history -- ' ","i":180576},{"w":"` Denial to me is vain , ' ","i":180728},{"w":"` I shall show you that I know more than that . ' ","i":180740},{"w":"` I did not , ' ","i":181072},{"w":"` but within the last fortnight I have learnt it all . You have a brother ; you know it , and him . There was a will , which your mother destroyed , leaving the secret and the gain to you at her own death . It contained a reference to some child likely to be the result of this sad connection , which child was born , and accidentally encountered by you , when your suspicions were first awakened by his resemblance to your father . You repaired to the place of his birth . There existed proofs -- proofs long suppressed -- of his birth and parentage . Those proofs were destroyed by you , and now , in your own words to your accomplice the Jew , '' the only proofs of the boy 's identity lie at the bottom of the river , and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin . '' Unworthy son , coward , liar , -- you , who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at night , -- you , whose plots and wiles have brought a violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as you , -- you , who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father 's heart , and in whom all evil passions , vice , and profligacy , festered , till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to your mind -- you , Edward Leeford , do you still brave me ! ' ","i":181085},{"w":"` It was the partial disclosure of your secrets , ' ","i":181512},{"w":"` Will you disclose the whole ? ' ","i":181527},{"w":"` The murderer ? ' ","i":181777},{"w":"` Yes , yes , ' ","i":181786},{"w":"` I will give fifty more , ' ","i":181874},{"w":"` and proclaim it with my own lips upon the spot , if I can reach it . Where is Mr. Maylie ? ' ","i":181886},{"w":"` what of him ? ' ","i":181976},{"w":"` Have you made up your mind ? ' ","i":182013},{"w":"` You -- you -- will be secret with me ? ' ","i":182041},{"w":"` This child , ' ","i":188920},{"w":"` is your half-brother ; the illegitimate son of your father , my dear friend Edwin Leeford , by poor young Agnes Fleming , who died in giving him birth . ' ","i":188942},{"w":"` Yes , ' ","i":188974},{"w":"` The term you use , ' ","i":189005},{"w":"` is a reproach to those long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world . It reflects disgrace on no one living , except you who use it . Let that pass . He was born in this town . ' ","i":189018},{"w":"` You have the story there . ' ","i":189075},{"w":"` I must have it here , too , ' ","i":189093},{"w":"` and enclosed in a few short lines to you , with an intimation on the cover of the package that it was not to be forwarded till after he was dead . One of these papers was a letter to this girl Agnes ; the other a will . ' ","i":189240},{"w":"` What of the letter ? ' ","i":189291},{"w":"` The letter ? -- A sheet of paper crossed and crossed again , with a penitent confession , and prayers to God to help her . He had palmed a tale on the girl that some secret mystery -- to be explained one day -- prevented his marrying her just then ; and so she had gone on , trusting patiently to him , until she trusted too far , and lost what none could ever give her back . She was , at that time , within a few months of her confinement . He told her all he had meant to do , to hide her shame , if he had lived , and prayed her , if he died , not to curse his memory , or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on her or their young child ; for all the guilt was his . He reminded her of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her christian name engraved upon it , and a blank left for that which he hoped one day to have bestowed upon her -- prayed her yet to keep it , and wear it next her heart , as she had done before -- and then ran on , wildly , in the same words , over and over again , as if he had gone distracted . I believe he had . ' ","i":189302},{"w":"` The will , ' ","i":189547},{"w":"` was in the same spirit as the letter . He talked of miseries which his wife had brought upon him ; of the rebellious disposition , vice , malice , and premature bad passions of you his only son , who had been trained to hate him ; and left you , and your mother , each an annuity of eight hundred pounds . The bulk of his property he divided into two equal portions -- one for Agnes Fleming , and the other for their child , if it should be born alive , and ever come of age . If it were a girl , it was to inherit the money unconditionally ; but if a boy , only on the stipulation that in his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act of dishonour , meanness , cowardice , or wrong . He did this , he said , to mark his confidence in the other , and his conviction -- only strengthened by approaching death -- that the child would share her gentle heart , and noble nature . If he were disappointed in this expectation , then the money was to come to you : for then , and not till then , when both children were equal , would he recognise your prior claim upon his purse , who had none upon his heart , but had , from an infant , repulsed him with coldness and aversion . ' ","i":189580},{"w":"` Years after this , ' ","i":190039},{"w":"` this man 's -- Edward Leeford 's -- mother came to me . He had left her , when only eighteen ; robbed her of jewels and money ; gambled , squandered , forged , and fled to London : where for two years he had associated with the lowest outcasts . She was sinking under a painful and incurable disease , and wished to recover him before she died . Inquiries were set on foot , and strict searches made . They were unavailing for a long time , but ultimately successful ; and he went back with her to France . ' ","i":190048},{"w":"` Do my hi 's deceive me ! ' ","i":190532},{"w":"` How do you do , sir ? I hope you are very well . ' ","i":190730},{"w":"` Certainly not , ' ","i":190860},{"w":"` Nothing , ' ","i":191245},{"w":"` except that it remains for us to take care that neither of you is employed in a situation of trust again . You may leave the room . ' ","i":191253},{"w":"` You may make up your mind to that , and think yourself well off besides . ' ","i":191337},{"w":"` You were present on the occasion of the destruction of these trinkets , and indeed are the more guilty of the two , in the eye of the law ; for the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction . ' ","i":191396},{"w":"` What was the fate of the other -- the child ? ' ","i":191709},{"w":"` Go on , ' ","i":191787},{"w":"` It is not indeed , my friend , ' ","i":196064},{"w":"` but my business with this man is intimately connected with him ; and as this child has seen him in the full career of his success and villainy , I think it as well -- even at the cost of some pain and fear -- that he should see him now . ' ","i":196078},{"w":"` You have some papers , ' ","i":196829},{"w":"` which were placed in your hands , for better security , by a man called Monks . ' ","i":196841},{"w":"` It 's all a lie together , ' ","i":196860},{"w":"` For the love of God , ' ","i":196882},{"w":"` do not say that now , upon the very verge of death ; but tell me where they are .
