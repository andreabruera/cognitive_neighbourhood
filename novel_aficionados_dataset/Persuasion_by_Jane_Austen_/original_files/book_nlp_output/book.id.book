He stood his chance for the rest ; wrote up for leave of absence , but without waiting the return , travelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth , rowed off to the Grappler that instant , and never left the poor fellow for a week .

An ancient family to be so driven away ! Strangers filling their place ! '' ","i":46990},{"w":"`` you will not think it a good place , for yours were always kept in the butler 's room . Ay , so it always is , I believe . One man 's ways may be as good as another 's , but we all like our own best . And so you must judge for yourself , whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not . '' ","i":47564},{"w":"`` I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life . Such a number of looking-glasses ! oh Lord ! there was no getting away from one 's self .

Such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing !

' Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife . She , poor soul , is tied by the leg . She has a blister on one of her heels , as large as a three-shilling piece . If you look across the street , you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother . Shabby fellows , both of them ! I am glad they are not on this side of the way . Sophy can not bear them . They played me a pitiful trick once : got away with some of my best men . I will tell you the whole story another time . There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson . Look , he sees us ; he kisses his hand to you ; he takes you for my wife . Ah ! the peace has come too soon for that younker . Poor old Sir Archibald ! How do you like Bath , Miss Elliot ? It suits us very well . We are always meeting with some old friend or other ; the streets full of them every morning ; sure to have plenty of chat ; and then we get away from them all , and shut ourselves in our lodgings , and draw in our chairs , and are as snug as if we were at Kellynch , ay , or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal . We do not like our lodgings here the worse , I can tell you , for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth . The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way .

'' ","i":65358},{"w":"`` Well , well , ladies are the best judges ; but James Benwick is rather too piano for me ; and though very likely it is all our partiality , Sophy and I can not help thinking Frederick 's manners better than his . There is something about Frederick more to our taste . '' ","i":65506},{"w":"`` I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends , '' ","i":65617},{"w":"`` And the thing is certainly true . It is not a mere bit of gossip . We have it from Frederick himself . His sister had a letter from him yesterday , in which he tells us of it , and he had just had it in a letter from Harville , written upon the spot , from Uppercross . I fancy they are all at Uppercross . '' ","i":65638},{"w":"`` I hope , Admiral , I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain Wentworth 's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy . It did seem , last autumn , as if there were an attachment between him and Louisa Musgrove ; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally , and without violence . I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man . '' ","i":65723},{"w":"`` Not at all , not at all ; there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end . '' ","i":65805},{"w":"`` Yes , yes , I understand you . But there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter . He does not give the least fling at Benwick ; does not so much as say , ' I wonder at it , I have a reason of my own for wondering at it . ' No , you would not guess , from his way of writing , that he had ever thought of this Miss -LRB- what 's her name ? -RRB- for himself . He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together ; and there is nothing very unforgiving in that , I think . '' ","i":65957},{"w":"`` Good morning to you !

One does not love a place the less for having suffered in it , unless it has been all suffering , nothing but suffering , which was by no means the case at Lyme . We were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours , and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment . So much novelty and beauty ! I have travelled so little , that every fresh place would be interesting to me ; but there is real beauty at Lyme ; and in short '' ","i":70237},{"w":"`` is nearly the sense , or rather the meaning of the words , for certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be talked of , but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give ; for I do not pretend to understand the language .

I am sure you have , somehow or other , imbibed such a notion . You must consider me only as Mr Elliot 's relation . If in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him , I beg you would not hesitate to employ me . '' ","i":74410},{"w":"`` No , '' ","i":74594},{"w":"`` nor next week , nor next , nor next . I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week .

He seems to have a calm decided temper , not at all open to dangerous impressions . I consider him with great respect . I have no reason , from any thing that has fallen within my observation , to do otherwise . But I have not known him long ; and he is not a man , I think , to be known intimately soon . Will not this manner of speaking of him , Mrs Smith , convince you that he is nothing to me ? Surely this must be calm enough . And , upon my word , he is nothing to me . Should he ever propose to me -LRB- which I have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing -RRB- , I shall not accept him . I assure you I shall not . I assure you , Mr Elliot had not the share which you have been supposing , in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford : not Mr Elliot ; it is not Mr Elliot that -- '' ","i":75070},{"w":"`` The whole history , '' ","i":75609},{"w":"`` though there is no truth in my having this claim on Mr Elliot , I should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that I could . Shall I mention to him your being in Bath ? Shall I take any message ? '' ","i":75657},{"w":"`` I beg your pardon , my dear Miss Elliot , '' ","i":75924},{"w":"`` I beg your pardon for the short answers I have been giving you , but I have been uncertain what I ought to do . I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you . There were many things to be taken into the account . One hates to be officious , to be giving bad impressions , making mischief . Even the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving , though there may be nothing durable beneath . However , I have determined ; I think I am right ; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot 's real character . Though I fully believe that , at present , you have not the smallest intention of accepting him , there is no saying what may happen . You might , some time or other , be differently affected towards him . Hear the truth , therefore , now , while you are unprejudiced . Mr Elliot is a man without heart or conscience ; a designing , wary , cold-blooded being , who thinks only of himself ; whom for his own interest or ease , would be guilty of any cruelty , or any treachery , that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character . He has no feeling for others . Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin , he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction . He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion . Oh ! he is black at heart , hollow and black ! '' ","i":75946},{"w":"`` My expressions startle you . You must allow for an injured , angry woman . But I will try to command myself . I will not abuse him . I will only tell you what I have found him . Facts shall speak . He was the intimate friend of my dear husband , who trusted and loved him , and thought him as good as himself . The intimacy had been formed before our marriage . I found them most intimate friends ; and I , too , became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot , and entertained the highest opinion of him . At nineteen , you know , one does not think very seriously ; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others , and much more agreeable than most others , and we were almost always together . We were principally in town , living in very good style . He was then the inferior in circumstances ; he was then the poor one ; he had chambers in the Temple , and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman . He had always a home with us whenever he chose it ; he was always welcome ; he was like a brother . My poor Charles , who had the finest , most generous spirit in the world , would have divided his last farthing with him ; and I know that his purse was open to him ; I know that he often assisted him . '' ","i":76246},{"w":"`` This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot 's life , '' ","i":76510},{"w":"`` which has always excited my particular curiosity . It must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister . I never knew him myself ; I only heard of him ; but there was a something in his conduct then , with regard to my father and sister , and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage , which I never could quite reconcile with present times . It seemed to announce a different sort of man . '' ","i":76529},{"w":"`` Nay , '' ","i":76787},{"w":"`` I have no particular enquiry to make about her . I have always understood they were not a happy couple . But I should like to know why , at that time of his life , he should slight my father 's acquaintance as he did . My father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him . Why did Mr Elliot draw back ? '' ","i":76794},{"w":"`` Perhaps , '' ","i":77077},{"w":"`` you sometimes spoke of me to Mr Elliot ? '' ","i":77090},{"w":"`` To be sure I did ; very often . I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot , and vouch for your being a very different creature from -- '' ","i":77101},{"w":"`` Indeed , my dear Mrs Smith , I want none , '' ","i":77613},{"w":"`` But for my satisfaction , if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary ; stay : I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom , and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet . '' ","i":77678},{"w":"`` I wish I had any name but Elliot . I am sick of it . The name of Walter I can drop , thank God ! and I desire you will never insult me with my second W. again , meaning , for the rest of my life , to be only yours truly , -- Wm. Elliot . '' ","i":78137},{"w":"`` Thank you . This is full proof undoubtedly ; proof of every thing you were saying . But why be acquainted with us now ? '' ","i":78361},{"w":"`` This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family , long before you returned to it ; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it , though he did not then visit in Camden Place ; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there , and when Mr Elliot came to Bath for a day or two , as he happened to do a little before Christmas , Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things , and the reports beginning to prevail . Now you are to understand , that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot 's opinions as to the value of a baronetcy . Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man . Having long had as much money as he could spend , nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence , he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to . I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased , but it is now a confirmed feeling . He can not bear the idea of not being Sir William . You may guess , therefore , that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable , and you may guess what it produced ; the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible , and of fixing himself here for a time , with the view of renewing his former acquaintance , and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger , and of circumventing the lady if he found it material . This was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done ; and Colonel Wallis was to assist in every way that he could . He was to be introduced , and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced , and everybody was to be introduced . Mr Elliot came back accordingly ; and on application was forgiven , as you know , and re-admitted into the family ; and there it was his constant object , and his only object -LRB- till your arrival added another motive -RRB- , to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay . He omitted no opportunity of being with them , threw himself in their way , called at all hours ; but I need not be particular on this subject . You can imagine what an artful man would do ; and with this guide , perhaps , may recollect what you have seen him do . '' ","i":79231},{"w":"`` Yes , '' ","i":79700},{"w":"`` you tell me nothing which does not accord with what I have known , or could imagine . There is always something offensive in the details of cunning . The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting , but I have heard nothing which really surprises me . I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot , who would have difficulty in believing it ; but I have never been satisfied . I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared . I should like to know his present opinion , as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of ; whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not . '' ","i":79707},{"w":"`` I am very glad to know all this , '' ","i":80071},{"w":"`` I am extremely glad , indeed , '' ","i":83837},{"w":"`` particularly glad that this should happen ; and that of two sisters , who both deserve equally well , and who have always been such good friends , the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other -- that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort . I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both . '' ","i":83849},{"w":"`` Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove , '' ","i":84096},{"w":"`` should be happy in their children 's marriages . They do everything to confer happiness , I am sure . What a blessing to young people to be in such hands ! Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery , both in young and old . I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now ? '' ","i":84110},{"w":"`` That can not be much to your taste , I know , '' ","i":84272},{"w":"`` but I do believe him to be an excellent young man . '' ","i":84289},{"w":"`` No , '' ","i":85670},{"w":"`` it can not be Mr Elliot , I assure you . He was to leave Bath at nine this morning , and does not come back till to-morrow . '' ","i":85679},{"w":"`` I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun . If I would not go for the sake of your father , I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir . What is Mr Elliot to me ? '' ","i":86523},{"w":"`` We had better put it off . Charles , you had much better go back and change the box for Tuesday . It would be a pity to be divided , and we should be losing Miss Anne , too , if there is a party at her father 's ; and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play , if Miss Anne could not be with us . '' ","i":86692},{"w":"`` If it depended only on my inclination , ma'am , the party at home -LRB- excepting on Mary 's account -RRB- would not be the smallest impediment . I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting , and should be too happy to change it for a play , and with you . But , it had better not be attempted , perhaps . '' ","i":86795},{"w":"`` I am not yet so much changed , '' ","i":87039},{"w":"`` I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted ! You see he can not put the card out of his hand . '' ","i":87707},{"w":"`` Oh ! dear ! very true . Only think , Miss Elliot , to my great surprise I met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street . I was never more astonished . He turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard . He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry , but I really forget by what ; for I was in a hurry , and could not much attend , and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return . He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow . He was full of ` to-morrow , ' and it is very evident that I have been full of it too , ever since I entered the house , and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened , or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head . '' ","i":88171},{"w":"`` No , '' ","i":89797},{"w":"`` True , '' ","i":90040},{"w":"`` very true ; I did not recollect ; but what shall we say now , Captain Harville ?

'' ","i":90047},{"w":"`` Your feelings may be the strongest , '' ","i":90188},{"w":"`` but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender . Man is more robust than woman , but he is not longer lived ; which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments . Nay , it would be too hard upon you , if it were otherwise . You have difficulties , and privations , and dangers enough to struggle with . You are always labouring and toiling , exposed to every risk and hardship . Your home , country , friends , all quitted . Neither time , nor health , nor life , to be called your own . It would be hard , indeed '' ","i":90200},{"w":"`` There is no hurry on my side . I am only ready whenever you are . I am in very good anchorage here , '' ","i":90467},{"w":"`` well supplied , and want for nothing . No hurry for a signal at all . Well , Miss Elliot , '' ","i":90499},{"w":"`` I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you , and by those who resemble you . God forbid that I should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures ! I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman . No , I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives . I believe you equal to every important exertion , and to every domestic forbearance , so long as -- if I may be allowed the expression -- so long as you have an object . I mean while the woman you love lives , and lives for you . All the privilege I claim for my own sex -LRB- it is not a very enviable one ; you need not covet it -RRB- , is that of loving longest , when existence or when hope is gone .

To-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party , '' ","i":91327},{"w":"`` Good morning , God bless you !

Hers is a line for seeing human nature ; and she has a fund of good sense and observation , which , as a companion , make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received ` the best education in the world , ' know nothing worth attending to . Call it gossip , if you will , but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour 's leisure to bestow on me , she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable : something that makes one know one 's species better . One likes to hear what is going on , to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly . To me , who live so much alone , her conversation , I assure you , is a treat . '' ","i":58543},{"w":"`` Yes , '' ","i":58984},{"w":"`` sometimes it may , though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe .

There is so little real friendship in the world ! and unfortunately '' ","i":58994},{"w":"`` I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present , will furnish much either to interest or edify me .

How I do wish I knew what you were at ! I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel , when the right moment occurs . Till it does come , you know , we women never mean to have anybody . It is a thing of course among us , that every man is refused , till he offers . But why should you be cruel ? Let me plead for my -- present friend I can not call him , but for my former friend . Where can you look for a more suitable match ? Where could you expect a more gentlemanlike , agreeable man ? Let me recommend Mr Elliot . I am sure you hear nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis ; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis ? '' ","i":74670},{"w":"`` Mr Elliot is safe , and I shall give myself no more trouble about him . Do not forget me when you are married , that 's all .

Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same . Of course , he can not be aware of the importance to me . Well , my dear Miss Elliot , I hope and trust you will be very happy . Mr Elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman . Your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been . You are safe in all worldly matters , and safe in his character . He will not be led astray ; he will not be misled by others to his ruin .

He was determined to make it by marriage . He was determined , at least , not to mar it by an imprudent marriage ; and I know it was his belief -LRB- whether justly or not , of course I can not decide -RRB- , that your father and sister , in their civilities and invitations , were designing a match between the heir and the young lady , and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence . That was his motive for drawing back , I can assure you . He told me the whole story . He had no concealments with me . It was curious , that having just left you behind me in Bath , my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin ; and that , through him , I should be continually hearing of your father and sister . He described one Miss Elliot , and I thought very affectionately of the other . '' ","i":76874},{"w":"`` This explains it . I found he had been used to hear of me . I could not comprehend how .

The circumstances , probably , which first opened your eyes to his character . '' ","i":77156},{"w":"`` This is full of papers belonging to him , to my husband ; a small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him . The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage , and happened to be saved ; why , one can hardly imagine . But he was careless and immethodical , like other men , about those things ; and when I came to examine his papers , I found it with others still more trivial , from different people scattered here and there , while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed . Here it is ; I would not burn it , because being even then very little satisfied with Mr Elliot , I was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy . I have now another motive for being glad that I can produce it . '' ","i":77775},{"w":"`` The language , I know , is highly disrespectful . Though I have forgot the exact terms , I have a perfect impression of the general meaning . But it shows you the man . Mark his professions to my poor husband . Can any thing be stronger ?

He saw you then at Lyme , and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in Camden Place , as Miss Anne Elliot , and from that moment , I have no doubt , had a double motive in his visits there . But there was another , and an earlier , which I will now explain . If there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable , stop me . My account states , that your sister 's friend , the lady now staying with you , whom I have heard you mention , came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September -LRB- in short when they first came themselves -RRB- , and has been staying there ever since ; that she is a clever , insinuating , handsome woman , poor and plausible , and altogether such in situation and manner , as to give a general idea , among Sir Walter 's acquaintance , of her meaning to be Lady Elliot , and as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently , blind to the danger .

In the first place , I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday , offering to convey anything to you ; a very kind , friendly note indeed , addressed to me , just as it ought ; I shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as I like . The Admiral does not seem very ill , and I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants . I shall be truly glad to have them back again . Our neighbourhood can not spare such a pleasant family . But now for Louisa . I have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little . She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely , and in the evening we went to ask her how she did , when we were rather surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the party , for he had been invited as well as the Harvilles ; and what do you think was the reason ? Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa , and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr Musgrove ; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away , and he had written to her father by Captain Harville . True , upon my honour ! Are not you astonished ? I shall be surprised at least if you ever received a hint of it , for I never did . Mrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter . We are all very well pleased , however , for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain Wentworth , it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter ; and Mr Musgrove has written his consent , and Captain Benwick is expected to-day . Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister 's account ; but , however , Louisa is a great favourite with both . Indeed , Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her . Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say ; but if you remember , I never thought him attached to Louisa ; I never could see anything of it . And this is the end , you see , of Captain Benwick 's being supposed to be an admirer of yours . How Charles could take such a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me . I hope he will be more agreeable now . Certainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove , but a million times better than marrying among the Hayters .
