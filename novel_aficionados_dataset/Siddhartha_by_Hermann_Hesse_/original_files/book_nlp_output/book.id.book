My dear , have you entirely forgotten that story , that story containing so many lessons , that story about Siddhartha , a Brahman 's son , which you once told me here on this very spot ?

The sinner , which I am and which you are , is a sinner , but in times to come he will be Brahma again , he will reach the Nirvana , will be Buddha -- and now see : these ` times to come ' are a deception , are only a parable ! The sinner is not on his way to become a Buddha , he is not in the process of developing , though our capacity for thinking does not know how else to picture these things . No , within the sinner is now and today already the future Buddha , his future is already all there , you have to worship in him , in you , in everyone the Buddha which is coming into being , the possible , the hidden Buddha . The world , my friend Govinda , is not imperfect , or on a slow path towards perfection : no , it is perfect in every moment , all sin already carries the divine forgiveness in itself , all small children already have the old person in themselves , all infants already have death , all dying people the eternal life . It is not possible for any person to see how far another one has already progressed on his path ; in the robber and dice-gambler , the Buddha is waiting ; in the Brahman , the robber is waiting . In deep meditation , there is the possibility to put time out of existence , to see all life which was , is , and will be as if it was simultaneous , and there everything is good , everything is perfect , everything is Brahman . Therefore , I see whatever exists as good , death is to me like life , sin like holiness , wisdom like foolishness , everything has to be as it is , everything only requires my consent , only my willingness , my loving agreement , to be good for me , to do nothing but work for my benefit , to be unable to ever harm me . I have experienced on my body and on my soul that I needed sin very much , I needed lust , the desire for possessions , vanity , and needed the most shameful despair , in order to learn how to give up all resistance , in order to learn how to love the world , in order to stop comparing it to some world I wished , I imagined , some kind of perfection I had made up , but to leave it as it is and to love it and to enjoy being a part of it . -- These , oh Govinda , are some of the thoughts which have come into my mind .

Thus , I would perhaps have thought in the past . But today I think : this stone is a stone , it is also animal , it is also god , it is also Buddha , I do not venerate and love it because it could turn into this or that , but rather because it is already and always everything -- and it is this very fact , that it is a stone , that it appears to me now and today as a stone , this is why I love it and see worth and purpose in each of its veins and cavities , in the yellow , in the gray , in the hardness , in the sound it makes when I knock at it , in the dryness or wetness of its surface . There are stones which feel like oil or soap , and others like leaves , others like sand , and every one is special and prays the Om in its own way , each one is Brahman , but simultaneously and just as much it is a stone , is oily or juicy , and this is this very fact which I like and regard as wonderful and worthy of worship . -- But let me speak no more of this . The words are not good for the secret meaning , everything always becomes a bit different , as soon as it is put into words , gets distorted a bit , a bit silly -- yes , and this is also very good , and I like it a lot , I also very much agree with this , that this what is one man 's treasure and wisdom always sounds like foolishness to another person .

He had noticed that the river 's spoke to him , he learned from it , it educated and taught him , the river seemed to be a god to him , for many years he did not know that every wind , every cloud , every bird , every beetle was just as divine and knows just as much and can teach just as much as the worshipped river .

And this is now a teaching you will laugh about : love , oh Govinda , seems to me to be the most important thing of all . To thoroughly understand the world , to explain it , to despise it , may be the thing great thinkers do .
