The very circumstances which inflict on you , as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here , such painful emotions , are to me , on the contrary , a source of something like contentment , and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation . The chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of their umbrageous boughs , while fancy pictures a moving multitude of shapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade . Here I have a garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the imagination , and furnished with thickly grown trees , beneath whose leafy screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will . This to me , who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight wall , is , I assure you , a most agreeable surprise . I have no fear of ghosts , and I have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a single day . Retire within , Bertuccio , and tranquillize your mind . Should your confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying moments than you found the Abbé Busoni , send for me , if I am still on earth , and I will soothe your ears with words that shall effectually calm and soothe your parting soul ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity .

These different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them , and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced them -- this is my treasure , my beloved friend , and with this you have made me rich and happy . Believe me , and take comfort , this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds , even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea , which we take for terra firma , and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them .

But when I added to the gun an English cutlass with which I had shivered his highness 's yataghan to pieces , the Bey yielded , and agreed to forgive the hand and head , but on condition that the poor fellow never again set foot in Tunis . This was a useless clause in the bargain , for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the shores of Africa , he runs down below , and can only be induced to appear again when we are out of sight of that quarter of the globe .

You do not know my mother ; she it is whom you see here . She had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago . This costume is a fancy one , it appears , and the resemblance is so great that I think I still see my mother the same as she was in 1830 . The countess had this portrait painted during the count 's absence . She doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise ; but , strange to say , this portrait seemed to displease my father , and the value of the picture , which is , as you see , one of the best works of Léopold Robert , could not overcome his dislike to it . It is true , between ourselves , that M. de Morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the Luxembourg , a general renowned for theory , but a most mediocre amateur of art . It is different with my mother , who paints exceedingly well , and who , unwilling to part with so valuable a picture , gave it to me to put here , where it would be less likely to displease M. de Morcerf , whose portrait , by Gros , I will also show you . Excuse my talking of family matters , but as I shall have the honor of introducing you to the count , I tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture . The picture seems to have a malign influence , for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it , and still more rarely does she look at it without weeping . This disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess , who are still as much united , although married more than twenty years , as on the first day of their wedding .

Consider yourself as in your own house , and to put yourself still more at your ease , pray accompany me to the apartments of M. de Morcerf , he whom I wrote from Rome an account of the services you rendered me , and to whom I announced your promised visit , and I may say that both the count and countess anxiously desire to thank you in person . You are somewhat blas I know , and family scenes have not much effect on Sinbad the Sailor , who has seen so many others . However , accept what I propose to you as an initiation into Parisian life -- a life of politeness , visiting , and introductions .

After every action requiring exertion , it is conscience that saves us , for it supplies us with a thousand good excuses , of which we alone are judges ; and these reasons , howsoever excellent in producing sleep , would avail us but very little before a tribunal , when we were tried for our lives . Thus Richard III. , for instance , was marvellously served by his conscience after the putting away of the two children of Edward IV. ; in fact , he could say , ` These two children of a cruel and persecuting king , who have inherited the vices of their father , which I alone could perceive in their juvenile propensities -- these two children are impediments in my way of promoting the happiness of the English people , whose unhappiness they -LRB- the children -RRB- would infallibly have caused . ' Thus was Lady Macbeth served by her conscience , when she sought to give her son , and not her husband -LRB- whatever Shakespeare may say -RRB- , a throne . Ah , maternal love is a great virtue , a powerful motive -- so powerful that it excuses a multitude of things , even if , after Duncan 's death , Lady Macbeth had been at all pricked by her conscience .

' Well , on my word of honor , I answered , ` No ! ' I wished no ill to Morcerf ; he was a little proud , perhaps , for a man who like myself has risen from nothing ; but we all have our faults . Do you know , count , that persons of our time of life -- not that you belong to the class , you are still a young man , -- but as I was saying , persons of our time of life have been very unfortunate this year .

Still I was but an agent , led on by an invisible and offended Deity , who chose not to withhold the fatal blow that I was destined to hurl . I take that God to witness , at whose feet I have prostrated myself daily for the last ten years , that I would have sacrificed my life to you , and with my life the projects that were indissolubly linked with it . But -- and I say it with some pride , Mercédès -- God needed me , and I lived . Examine the past and the present , and endeavor to dive into futurity , and then say whether I am not a divine instrument . The most dreadful misfortunes , the most frightful sufferings , the abandonment of all those who loved me , the persecution of those who did not know me , formed the trials of my youth ; when suddenly , from captivity , solitude , misery , I was restored to light and liberty , and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant , so unbounded , so unheard-of , that I must have been blind not to be conscious that God had endowed me with it to work out his own great designs . From that time I looked upon this fortune as something confided to me for a particular purpose . Not a thought was given to a life which you once , Mercédès , had the power to render blissful ; not one hour of peaceful calm was mine ; but I felt myself driven on like an exterminating angel . Like adventurous captains about to embark on some enterprise full of danger , I laid in my provisions , I loaded my weapons , I collected every means of attack and defence ; I inured my body to the most violent exercises , my soul to the bitterest trials ; I taught my arm to slay , my eyes to behold excruciating sufferings , and my mouth to smile at the most horrid spectacles . Good-natured , confiding , and forgiving as I had been , I became revengeful , cunning , and wicked , or rather , immovable as fate . Then I launched out into the path that was opened to me . I overcame every obstacle , and reached the goal ; but woe to those who stood in my pathway ! '' ","i":555431},{"w":"`` Ah , madame , '' ","i":556575},{"w":"`` you should not talk thus !

Too many diamonds , too much gold and splendor , are now reflected by the mirror in which Monte Cristo seeks to behold Dantès . Hide thy diamonds , bury thy gold , shroud thy splendor , exchange riches for poverty , liberty for a prison , a living body for a corpse !

I made them one day to calculate the age of my father , that I might know whether I should find him still living , and that of Mercédès , to know if I should find her still free . After finishing that calculation , I had a minute 's hope . I did not reckon upon hunger and infidelity !
