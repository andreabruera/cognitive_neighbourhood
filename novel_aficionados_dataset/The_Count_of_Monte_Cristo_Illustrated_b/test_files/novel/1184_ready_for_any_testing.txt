on the 24th of february 1815 the look out at notre dame de la garde signalled the three master the pharaon from smyrna trieste and naples as usual a pilot put off immediately and rounding the chã teau dâ if got on board the vessel between cape morgiou and rion island immediately and according to custom the ramparts of fort saint jean were covered with spectators it is always an event at marseilles for a ship to come into port especially when this ship like the pharaon has been built rigged and laden at the old phocee docks and belongs to an owner of the city the ship drew on and had safely passed the strait which some volcanic shock has made between the calasareigne and jaros islands had doubled pomã gue and approached the harbor under topsails jib and spanker but so slowly and sedately that the idlers with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board however those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred it was not to the vessel herself for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled the anchor a cockbill the jib boom guys already eased off and standing by the side of the pilot who was steering the pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port was a young man who with activity and vigilant eye watched every motion of the ship and repeated each direction of the pilot the vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor but jumping into a small skiff desired to be pulled alongside the pharaon which he reached as she rounded into la rã serve basin
when the young man on board saw this person approach he left his station by the pilot and hat in hand leaned over the shipâ bulwarks he was a fine tall slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty with black eye and hair as dark as a ravenâ wing and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to man accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger ah is it you edmond_dantã_s cried the man in the skiff whatâ the matter and why have you such an air of sadness aboard â a great misfortune m_maximilian_morrel replied the young man a great misfortune for me especially off civita vecchia we lost our brave captain leclere â and the cargo inquired the owner eagerly is all safe m_maximilian_morrel and i think you will be satisfied on that head but poor captain leclereâ â what happened to him asked the owner with an air of considerable resignation what happened to the worthy captain â he died â fell into the sea â no sir he died of brain fever in dreadful agony then turning to the crew he said bear a hand there to take in sail all hand obeyed and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the crew sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and outhaul topsail sheets and halyards the jib downhaul and the topsail clewlines and buntlines the young sailor gave a look to see that his order were promptly and accurately obeyed and then turned again to the owner and how did this misfortune occur inquired the latter resuming the interrupted conversation 0023 â alas sir in the most unexpected manner after a long talk with the harbor master captain leclere left naples greatly disturbed in mind
in twenty four hour he was attacked by a fever and died three day afterwards we performed the usual burial service and he is at his rest sewn up in his hammock with a thirty six pound shot at his head and his heels off el giglio island we bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor it was worth while truly added the young man with a melancholy smile to make war against the english for ten year and to die in his bed at last like everybody else â why you see edmond_dantã_s replied the owner who appeared more comforted at every moment we are all mortal and the old must make way for the young if not why there would be no promotion and since you assure me that the cargoâ â is all safe and sound m_maximilian_morrel take my word for it and i advise you not to take 25 000 franc for the profits of the voyage then as they were just passing the round tower the young man shouted stand by there to lower the topsails and jib brail up the spanker the order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a man of war let goâ and clue up at this last command all the sails were lowered and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards now if you will come on board m_maximilian_morrel said edmond_dantã_s observing the ownerâ impatience here is your supercargo mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars coming out of his cabin who will furnish you with every particular as for me i must look after the anchoring and dress the ship in mourning the owner did not wait for a second invitation
he seized a rope which edmond_dantã_s flung to him and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor climbed up the side of the ship while the young man going to his task left the conversation to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who now came towards the owner he was a man of twenty five or twenty six year of age of unprepossessing countenance obsequious to his superiors insolent to his subordinates and this in addition to his position as responsible agent on board which is always obnoxious to the sailors made him as much disliked by the crew as edmond_dantã_s was beloved by them well m_maximilian_morrel said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us â yesâ yes poor captain leclere he was a brave and an honest man â and a first rate seaman one who had seen long and honorable service as became a man charged with the interests of a house_of_peers so important as that of m_maximilian_morrel son replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars but replied the owner glancing after edmond_dantã_s who was watching the anchoring of his vessel â_it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars to understand his business for our friend edmond_dantã_s seems to understand it thoroughly and not to require instruction from anyone â_yes said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars darting at edmond_dantã_s a look gleaming with hate â_yes he is young and youth is invariably self confident
scarcely was the captainâ breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the island of elba instead of making for marseilles direct 0025m as to taking command of the vessel replied m_maximilian_morrel that was his duty as captainâ mate as to losing a day and a half off the island of elba he was wrong unless the vessel needed repairs â the vessel was in as good condition as i am and as i hope you are m_maximilian_morrel and this day and a half was lost from pure whim for the pleasure of going ashore and nothing else â edmond_dantã_s said the shipowner turning towards the young man come this way â in a moment sir answered edmond_dantã_s and iâ with you then calling to the crew he said let go the anchor was instantly dropped and the chain ran rattling through the port hole edmond_dantã_s continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot until this manå uvre was completed and then he added half mast the colors and square the yards â you see said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars he fancies himself captain already upon my word â and so in fact he is said the owner except your signature and your partnerâ m_maximilian_morrel â and why should he not have this asked the owner he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full experience a cloud passed over danglarsâ brow your pardon m_maximilian_morrel said edmond_dantã_s approaching the vessel now rides at anchor and i am at your service you hailed me i think mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars retreated a step or two
â i wished to inquire why you stopped at the island of elba â i do not know sir it was to fulfil the last instructions of captain leclere who when dying gave me a packet for marshal bertrand â then did you see him edmond_dantã_s â who â the marshal â_yes m_maximilian_morrel looked around him and then drawing edmond_dantã_s on one side he said suddenlyâ and how is the emperor â very well as far as i could judge from the sight of him â you saw the emperor then â he entered the marshalâ apartment while i was there â and you spoke to him â why it was he who spoke to me sir said edmond_dantã_s with a smile and what did he say to you â asked me questions about the vessel the time she left marseilles the course she had taken and what was her cargo i believe if she had not been laden and i had been her master he would have bought her but i told him i was only mate and that she belonged to the firm of m_maximilian_morrel son ah yes he said i know them the morrels have been shipowners from father to son and there was a m_maximilian_morrel who served in the same regiment with me when i was in garrison at valence â pardieu and that is true cried the owner greatly delighted and that was policar m_maximilian_morrel my uncle who was afterwards a captain edmond_dantã_s you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldierâ eye
come come continued he patting edmondâ shoulder kindly you did very right edmond_dantã_s to follow captain leclereâ instructions and touch at elba although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal and had conversed with the emperor it might bring you into trouble 0027m how could that bring me into trouble sir asked edmond_dantã_s for i did not even know of what i was the bearer and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer but pardon me here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside and the young man went to the gangway as he departed mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars approached and said â well it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at porto ferrajo â_yes most satisfactory my dear mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â well so much the better said the supercargo for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty â edmond_dantã_s has done his replied the owner and that is not saying much it was captain leclere who gave order for this delay â talking of captain leclere has not edmond_dantã_s given you a letter from him â to me noâ was there one â i believe that besides the packet captain leclere confided a letter to his care â of what packet are you speaking mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â why that which edmond_dantã_s left at porto ferrajo â how do you know he had a packet to leave at porto ferrajo mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars turned very red i was passing close to the door of the captainâ cabin which was half open and i saw him give the packet and letter to edmond_dantã_s â he did not speak to me of it replied the shipowner but if there be any letter he will give it to me mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars reflected for a moment
â then m_maximilian_morrel i beg of you said he not to say a word to edmond_dantã_s on the subject i may have been mistaken at this moment the young man returned mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars withdrew well my dear edmond_dantã_s are you now free inquired the owner â_yes sir â you have not been long detained â no i gave the custom house_of_peers officers a copy of our bill of lading and as to the other paper they sent a man off with the pilot to whom i gave them â then you have nothing more to do here â noâ everything is all right now â then you can come and dine with me â i really must ask you to excuse me m_maximilian_morrel my first visit is due to my father though i am not the less grateful for the honor you have done me 0029m right edmond_dantã_s quite right i always knew you were a good son â and inquired edmond_dantã_s with some hesitation do you know how my father is â well i believe my dear edmond_dantã_s though i have not seen him lately â_yes he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room â that proves at least that he has wanted for nothing during your absence edmond_dantã_s smiled my father is proud sir and if he had not a meal left i doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone except from heaven â well then after this first visit has been made we shall count on you â i must again excuse myself m_maximilian_morrel for after this first visit has been paid i have another which i am most anxious to pay â true edmond_dantã_s i forgot that there was at the catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your fatherâ the lovely mercã_dã_s edmond_dantã_s blushed
â ah ha said the shipowner i am not in the least surprised for she has been to me three time inquiring if there were any news of the pharaon peste edmond_dantã_s you have a very handsome mistress â she is not my mistress replied the young sailor gravely she is my betrothed â sometimes one and the same thing said m_maximilian_morrel with a smile not with us sir replied edmond_dantã_s well well my dear edmond_dantã_s continued the owner donâ let me detain you you have managed my affairs so well that i ought to allow you all the time you require for your own do you want any money â no sir i have all my pay to takeâ nearly three monthsâ wages â you are a careful fellow edmond_dantã_s â say i have a poor father sir â_yes yes i know how good a son you are so now hasten away to see your father i have a son too and i should be very wroth with those who detained him from me after a three monthsâ voyage â then i have your leave sir â_yes if you have nothing more to say to me â nothing â captain leclere did not before he died give you a letter for me â he was unable to write sir but that reminds me that i must ask your leave of absence for some day â to get married â_yes first and then to go to paris â very good have what time you require edmond_dantã_s
it will take quite six weeks to unload the cargo and we cannot get you ready for sea until three month after that only be back again in three month for the pharaon added the owner patting the young sailor on the back cannot sail without her captain â without her captain cried edmond_dantã_s his eye sparkling with animation pray mind what you say for you are touching on the most secret wishes of my heart is it really your intention to make me captain of the pharaon â if i were sole owner weâ shake hand on it now my dear edmond_dantã_s and call it settled but i have a partner and you know the italian proverbâ chi ha compagno ha padrone â he who has a partner has a master but the thing is at least half done as you have one out of two votes rely on me to procure you the other i will do my best â ah m_maximilian_morrel exclaimed the young seaman with tears in his eye and grasping the ownerâ hand m_maximilian_morrel i thank you in the name of my father and of mercã_dã_s â thatâ all right edmond_dantã_s thereâ a providence that watches over the deserving go to your father go and see mercã_dã_s and afterwards come to me â shall i row you ashore â no thank you i shall remain and look over the accounts with mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars have you been satisfied with him this voyage â that is according to the sense you attach to the question sir do you mean is he a good comrade
no for i think he never liked me since the day when i was silly enough after a little quarrel we had to propose to him to stop for ten minute at the island of count_of_monte_cristo to settle the disputeâ a proposition which i was wrong to suggest and he quite right to refuse if you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question i believe there is nothing to say against him and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty â but tell me edmond_dantã_s if you had command of the pharaon should you be glad to see mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars remain â captain or mate m_maximilian_morrel i shall always have the greatest respect for those who possess the ownersâ confidence â thatâ right thatâ right edmond_dantã_s i see you are a thoroughly good fellow and will detain you no longer go for i see how impatient you are â then i have leave â go i tell you â may i have the use of your skiff â certainly â then for the present m_maximilian_morrel farewell and a thousand thanks â i hope soon to see you again my dear edmond_dantã_s good luck to you the young sailor jumped into the skiff and sat down in the stern sheets with the order that he be put ashore at la canebiã re the two oarsmen bent to their work and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the quai dâ orlã ans
the shipowner smiling followed him with his eye until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng which from five oâ clock in the morning until nine oâ clock at night swarms in the famous street of la canebiã re a street of which the modern phocã ens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said if paris had la canebiã re paris would be a second marseilles on turning round the owner saw mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars behind him apparently awaiting order but in reality also watching the young sailor but there was a great difference in the expression of the two man who thus followed the movements of edmond_dantã_s chapter father and son we will leave mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars struggling with the demon of hatred and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade and follow edmond_dantã_s who after having traversed la canebiã re took the rue de noailles and entering a small house_of_peers on the left of the allã es de meilhan rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase holding the baluster with one hand while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart and paused before a half open door from which he could see the whole of a small room this room was occupied by dantã sâ father the news of the arrival of the pharaon had not yet reached the old man who mounted on a chair was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window suddenly he felt an arm thrown around his body and a well known voice behind him exclaimed fatherâ dear father
the old man uttered a cry and turned round then seeing his son he fell into his arm pale and trembling what ails you my dearest father are you ill inquired the young man much alarmed no no my dear edmondâ my boyâ my son no but i did not expect you and joy the surprise of seeing you so suddenlyâ ah i feel as if i were going to die â come come cheer up my dear father tis iâ really i they say joy never hurts and so i came to you without any warning come now do smile instead of looking at me so solemnly here i am back again and we are going to be happy â_yes yes my boy so we willâ so we will replied the old man but how shall we be happy shall you never leave me again come tell me all the good fortune that has befallen you â god forgive me said the young man for rejoicing at happiness derived from the misery of others but heaven knows i did not seek this good fortune it has happened and i really cannot pretend to lament it the good captain leclere is dead father and it is probable that with the aid of m_maximilian_morrel i shall have his place do you understand father only imagine me a captain at twenty with a hundred louis_xviii pay and a share in the profits is this not more than a poor sailor like me could have hoped for â_yes my dear boy replied the old man â_it is very fortunate â well then with the first money i touch i mean you to have a small house_of_peers with a garden in which to plant clematis nasturtiums and honeysuckle but what ails you father
are you not well â tis nothing nothing it will soon pass awayâ and as he said so the old manâ strength failed him and he fell backwards come come said the young man a glass of wine father will revive you where do you keep your wine â no no thanks you need not look for it i do not want it said the old man â_yes yes father tell me where it is and he opened two or three cupboards â_it is no use said the old man there is no wine â what no wine said edmond_dantã_s turning pale and looking alternately at the hollow cheeks of the old man and the empty cupboards what no wine have you wanted money father â i want nothing now that i have you said the old man yet stammered edmond_dantã_s wiping the perspiration from his brow â yet i gave you two hundred franc when i left three month ago â_yes yes edmond_dantã_s that is true but you forgot at that time a little debt to our neighbor m_caderousse he reminded me of it telling me if i did not pay for you he would be paid by m_maximilian_morrel and so you see lest he might do you an injuryâ â well â why i paid him â but cried edmond_dantã_s â_it was a hundred and forty franc i owed m_caderousse â_yes stammered the old man and you paid him out of the two hundred franc i left you the old man nodded so that you have lived for three month on sixty franc muttered edmond_dantã_s you know how little i require said the old man heaven pardon me cried edmond_dantã_s falling on his knees before his father
â what are you doing â you have wounded me to the heart â never mind it for i see you once more said the old man and now itâ all overâ everything is all right again 0035m â_yes here i am said the young man with a promising future and a little money here father here he said take thisâ take it and send for something immediately and he emptied his pockets on the table the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces five or six five franc pieces and some smaller coin the countenance of old edmond_dantã_s brightened whom does this belong to he inquired to me to you to us take it buy some provisions be happy and tomorrow we shall have more â gently gently said the old man with a smile and by your leave i will use your purse moderately for they would say if they saw me buy too many thing at a time that i had been obliged to await your return in order to be able to purchase them â do as you please but first of all pray have a servant father i will not have you left alone so long i have some smuggled coffee and most capital tobacco in a small chest in the hold which you shall have tomorrow but hush here comes somebody â tis m_caderousse who has heard of your arrival and no doubt comes to congratulate you on your fortunate return â ah lip that say one thing while the heart thinks another murmured edmond_dantã_s but never mind he is a neighbor who has done us a service on a time so heâ welcome as edmond_dantã_s paused the black and bearded head of m_caderousse appeared at the door
he was a man of twenty five or six and held a piece of cloth which being a tailor he was about to make into a coat lining what is it you edmond_dantã_s back again said he with a broad marseillaise accent and a grin that displayed his ivory white teeth â_yes as you see neighbor m_caderousse and ready to be agreeable to you in any and every way replied edmond_dantã_s but ill concealing his coldness under this cloak of civility thanksâ thanks but fortunately i do not want for anything and it chances that at time there are others who have need of me edmond_dantã_s made a gesture i do not allude to you my boy no no i lent you money and you returned it thatâ like good neighbors and we are quits â we are never quits with those who oblige us was dantã sâ reply for when we do not owe them money we owe them gratitude â whatâ the use of mentioning that what is done is done let us talk of your happy return my boy i had gone on the quay to match a piece of mulberry cloth when i met friend mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars you at marseilles â â_yes says he â i thought you were at smyrna â i was but am now back again â and where is the dear boy our little edmond_dantã_s â why with his father no doubt replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and so i came added m_caderousse as fast as i could to have the pleasure of shaking hand with a friend 0037m worthy m_caderousse said the old man he is so much attached to us â_yes to be sure i am i love and esteem you because honest folks are so rare
but it seems you have come back rich my boy continued the tailor looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which edmond_dantã_s had thrown on the table the young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eye of his neighbor eh he said negligently this money is not mine i was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many thing in my absence and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table come fatherâ added edmond_dantã_s put this money back in your boxâ unless neighbor m_caderousse wants anything and in that case it is at his service â no my boy no said m_caderousse i am not in any want thank god my living is suited to my means keep your moneyâ keep it i say one never has too much but at the same time my boy i am as much obliged by your offer as if i took advantage of it â_it was offered with good will said edmond_dantã_s no doubt my boy no doubt well you stand well with m_maximilian_morrel i hear you insinuating dog you â m_maximilian_morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me replied edmond_dantã_s then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him â what did you refuse to dine with him said old edmond_dantã_s and did he invite you to dine â_yes my dear father replied edmond_dantã_s smiling at his fatherâ astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son and why did you refuse my son inquired the old man that i might the sooner see you again my dear father replied the young man i was most anxious to see you â but it must have vexed m_maximilian_morrel good worthy man said m_caderousse
â and when you are looking forward to be captain it was wrong to annoy the owner â but i explained to him the cause of my refusal replied edmond_dantã_s and i hope he fully understood it â_yes but to be captain one must do a little flattery to oneâ patrons â i hope to be captain without that said edmond_dantã_s so much the betterâ so much the better nothing will give greater pleasure to all your old friend and i know one down there behind the saint nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it â mercã_dã_s said the old man â_yes my dear father and with your permission now i have seen you and know you are well and have all you require i will ask your consent to go and pay a visit to the catalans â go my dear boy said old edmond_dantã_s and heaven bless you in your wife as it has blessed me in my son â his wife said m_caderousse why how fast you go on father edmond_dantã_s she is not his wife yet as it seems to me â no but according to all probability she soon will be replied edmond_dantã_s yesâ yes said m_caderousse but you were right to return as soon as possible my boy â and why â because mercã_dã_s is a very fine girl and fine girl never lack followers she particularly has them by dozens â really answered edmond_dantã_s with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness 0039 â ah yes continued m_caderousse and capital offers too but you know you will be captain and who could refuse you then â meaning to say replied edmond_dantã_s with a smile which but ill concealed his trouble that if i were not a captainâ â ehâ eh said m_caderousse shaking his head
â come come said the sailor i have a better opinion than you of woman in general and of mercã_dã_s in particular and i am certain that captain or not she will remain ever faithful to me â so much the betterâ so much the better said m_caderousse when one is going to be married there is nothing like implicit confidence but never mind that my boy go and announce your arrival and let her know all your hopes and prospects â i will go directly was edmondâ reply and embracing his father and nodding to m_caderousse he left the apartment m_caderousse lingered for a moment then taking leave of old edmond_dantã_s he went downstairs to rejoin mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who awaited him at the corner of the rue senac well said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars did you see him â i have just left him answered m_caderousse did he allude to his hope of being captain â he spoke of it as a thing already decided â indeed said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars he is in too much hurry it appears to me â why it seems m_maximilian_morrel has promised him the thing â so that he is quite elated about it â why yes he is actually insolent over the matterâ has already offered me his patronage as if he were a grand personage and proffered me a loan of money as though he were a banker â which you refused â most assuredly although i might easily have accepted it for it was i who put into his hand the first silver he ever earned but now edmond_dantã_s has no longer any occasion for assistanceâ he is about to become a captain â pooh said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars he is not one yet â ma foi
it will be as well if he is not answered m_caderousse for if he should be there will be really no speaking to him â if we choose replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars he will remain what he is and perhaps become even less than he is â what do you mean â nothingâ i was speaking to myself and is he still in love with the catalane â over head and ears but unless i am much mistaken there will be a storm in that quarter 0041m explain yourself â why should i â_it is more important than you think perhaps you do not like edmond_dantã_s â i never like upstarts â then tell me all you know about the catalane â i know nothing for certain only i have seen thing which induce me to believe as i told you that the future captain will find some annoyance in the vicinity of the vieilles infirmeries â what have you seen come tell me â well every time i have seen mercã_dã_s come into the city she has been accompanied by a tall strapping black eyed catalan with a red complexion brown skin and fierce air whom she calls cousin â really and you think this cousin pays her attentions â i only suppose so what else can a strapping chap of twenty one mean with a fine wench of seventeen â and you say that edmond_dantã_s has gone to the catalans â he went before i came down â let us go the same way we will stop at la rã serve and we can drink a glass of la malgue whilst we wait for news â come along said m_caderousse but you pay the score â of course replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and going quickly to the designated place they called for a bottle of wine and two glass
pã re pamphile had seen edmond_dantã_s pass not ten minute before and assured that he was at the catalans they sat down under the budding foliage of the planes and sycamores in the branches of which the birds were singing their welcome to one of the first day of spring chapter the catalans beyond a bare weather worn wall about a hundred paces from the spot where the two friend sat looking and listening as they drank their wine was the village of the catalans long ago this mysterious colony quitted spain and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this day whence it came no one knew and it spoke an unknown tongue one of its chiefs who understood provenã al begged the commune of marseilles to give them this bare and barren promontory where like the sailors of old they had run their boats ashore the request was granted and three month afterwards around the twelve or fifteen small vessels which had brought these gypsies of the sea a small village sprang up this village constructed in a singular and picturesque manner half moorish half spanish still remains and is inhabited by descendants of the first comers who speak the language of their father for three or four centuries they have remained upon this small promontory on which they had settled like a flight of seabirds without mixing with the marseillaise population intermarrying and preserving their original customs and the costume of their mother country as they have preserved its language our readers will follow us along the only street of this little village and enter with us one of the house which is sunburned to the beautiful dead leaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country and within coated with whitewash like a spanish posada
a young and beautiful girl with hair as black as jet her eye as velvety as the gazelleâ was leaning with her back against the wainscot rubbing in her slender delicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms the flowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the floor her arm bare to the elbow brown and modelled after those of the arlesian venus moved with a kind of restless impatience and she tapped the earth with her arched and supple foot so as to display the pure and full shape of her well turned leg in its red cotton gray and blue clocked stocking at three paces from her seated in a chair which he balanced on two legs leaning his elbow on an old worm eaten table was a tall young man of twenty or two and twenty who was looking at her with an air in which vexation and uneasiness were mingled he questioned her with his eye but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look you see mercã_dã_s said the young man here is easter come round again tell me is this the moment for a wedding â i have answered you a hundred time m_fernand_mondego and really you must be very stupid to ask me again â well repeat it repeat it i beg of you that i may at last believe it tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love which had your motherâ sanction make me understand once for all that you are trifling with my happiness that my life or death are nothing to you
ah to have dreamed for ten year of being your husband mercã_dã_s and to lose that hope which was the only stay of my existence â at least it was not i who ever encouraged you in that hope m_fernand_mondego replied mercã_dã_s you cannot reproach me with the slightest coquetry i have always said to you i love you as a brother but do not ask from me more than sisterly affection for my heart is anotherâ â is not this true m_fernand_mondego â_yes that is very true mercã_dã_s replied the young man â_yes you have been cruelly frank with me but do you forget that it is among the catalans a sacred law to intermarry 0045 â you mistake m_fernand_mondego it is not a law but merely a custom and i pray of you do not cite this custom in your favor you are included in the conscription m_fernand_mondego and are only at liberty on sufferance liable at any moment to be called upon to take up arm once a soldier what would you do with me a poor orphan forlorn without fortune with nothing but a half ruined hut and a few ragged nets the miserable inheritance left by my father to my mother and by my mother to me she has been dead a year and you know m_fernand_mondego i have subsisted almost entirely on public charity sometimes you pretend i am useful to you and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing and i accept it m_fernand_mondego because you are the son of my fatherâ brother because we were brought up together and still more because it would give you so much pain if i refuse
but i feel very deeply that this fish which i go and sell and with the produce of which i buy the flax i spin i feel very keenly m_fernand_mondego that this is charity â and if it were mercã_dã_s poor and lone as you are you suit me as well as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of marseilles what do such as we desire but a good wife and careful housekeeper and where can i look for these better than in you â m_fernand_mondego answered mercã_dã_s shaking her head a woman becomes a bad manager and who shall say she will remain an honest woman when she loves another man better than her husband rest content with my friendship for i say once more that is all i can promise and i will promise no more than i can bestow â i understand replied m_fernand_mondego you can endure your own wretchedness patiently but you are afraid to share mine well mercã_dã_s beloved by you i would tempt fortune you would bring me good luck and i should become rich i could extend my occupation as a fisherman might get a place as clerk in a warehouse and become in time a dealer myself â you could do no such thing m_fernand_mondego you are a soldier and if you remain at the catalans it is because there is no war so remain a fisherman and contented with my friendship as i cannot give you more â well i will do better mercã_dã_s i will be a sailor instead of the costume of our father which you despise i will wear a varnished hat a striped shirt and a blue jacket with an anchor on the buttons would not that dress please you â what do you mean
asked mercã_dã_s with an angry glance â what do you mean i do not understand you â i mean mercã_dã_s that you are thus harsh and cruel with me because you are expecting someone who is thus attired but perhaps he whom you await is inconstant or if he is not the sea is so to him â m_fernand_mondego cried mercã_dã_s i believed you were good hearted and i was mistaken m_fernand_mondego you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the anger of god yes i will not deny it i do await and i do love him of whom you speak and if he does not return instead of accusing him of the inconstancy which you insinuate i will tell you that he died loving me and me only the young girl made a gesture of rage i understand you m_fernand_mondego you would be revenged on him because i do not love you you would cross your catalan knife with his dirk what end would that answer to lose you my friendship if he were conquered and see that friendship changed into hate if you were victor believe me to seek a quarrel with a man is a bad method of pleasing the woman who loves that man no m_fernand_mondego you will not thus give way to evil thoughts unable to have me for your wife you will content yourself with having me for your friend and sister and besides she added her eye troubled and moistened with tears wait wait m_fernand_mondego you said just now that the sea was treacherous and he has been gone four month and during these four month there have been some terrible storms
fernand made no reply nor did he attempt to check the tears which flowed down the cheeks of mercã_dã_s although for each of these tears he would have shed his heartâ blood but these tears flowed for another he arose paced a while up and down the hut and then suddenly stopping before mercã_dã_s with his eye glowing and his hand clenched â say mercã_dã_s he said once for all is this your final determination â i love edmond_dantã_s the young girl calmly replied and none but edmond_dantã_s shall ever be my husband â and you will always love him â as long as i live m_fernand_mondego let fall his head like a defeated man heaved a sigh that was like a groan and then suddenly looking her full in the face with clenched teeth and expanded nostrils said â but if he is deadâ â if he is dead i shall die too â if he has forgotten youâ â mercã_dã_s called a joyous voice from without â mercã_dã_s â ah exclaimed the young girl blushing with delight and fairly leaping in excess of love you see he has not forgotten me for here he is and rushing towards the door she opened it saying here edmond_dantã_s here i am m_fernand_mondego pale and trembling drew back like a traveller at the sight of a serpent and fell into a chair beside him edmond_dantã_s and mercã_dã_s were clasped in each otherâ arm the burning marseilles sun which shot into the room through the open door covered them with a flood of light at first they saw nothing around them their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world and they only spoke in broken word which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather the expression of sorrow
suddenly edmond_dantã_s saw the gloomy pale and threatening countenance of m_fernand_mondego as it was defined in the shadow by a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself the young catalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt ah your pardon said edmond_dantã_s frowning in his turn i did not perceive that there were three of us then turning to mercã_dã_s he inquired who is this gentleman â one who will be your best friend edmond_dantã_s for he is my friend my cousin my brother it is fernandâ the man whom after you edmond_dantã_s i love the best in the world do you not remember him â_yes said edmond_dantã_s and without relinquishing mercã dã sâ hand clasped in one of his own he extended the other to the catalan with a cordial air but m_fernand_mondego instead of responding to this amiable gesture remained mute and trembling edmond_dantã_s then cast his eye scrutinizingly at the agitated and embarrassed mercã_dã_s and then again on the gloomy and menacing m_fernand_mondego this look told him all and his anger waxed hot i did not know when i came with such haste to you that i was to meet an enemy here â an enemy cried mercã_dã_s with an angry look at her cousin an enemy in my house_of_peers do you say edmond_dantã_s if i believed that i would place my arm under yours and go with you to marseilles leaving the house_of_peers to return to it no more fernandâ eye darted lightning
â and should any misfortune occur to you dear edmond_dantã_s she continued with the same calmness which proved to m_fernand_mondego that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his sinister thought if misfortune should occur to you i would ascend the highest point of the cape de morgiou and cast myself headlong from it m_fernand_mondego became deadly pale but you are deceived edmond_dantã_s she continued you have no enemy hereâ there is no one but m_fernand_mondego my brother who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend and at these word the young girl fixed her imperious look on the catalan who as if fascinated by it came slowly towards edmond_dantã_s and offered him his hand his hatred like a powerless though furious wave was broken against the strong ascendancy which mercã_dã_s exercised over him scarcely however had he touched edmondâ hand when he felt he had done all he could do and rushed hastily out of the house_of_peers â_oh he exclaimed running furiously and tearing his hairâ â_oh who will deliver me from this man wretchedâ wretched that i am â hallo catalan hallo m_fernand_mondego where are you running to exclaimed a voice the young man stopped suddenly looked around him and perceived m_caderousse sitting at table with mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars under an arbor wellâ said m_caderousse why donâ you come are you really in such a hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friend â particularly when they have still a full bottle before them added mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_fernand_mondego looked at them both with a stupefied air but did not say a word he seems besotted said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars pushing m_caderousse with his knee are
we mistaken and is edmond_dantã_s triumphant in spite of all we have believed â why we must inquire into that was caderousseâ reply and turning towards the young man said well catalan canâ you make up your mind m_fernand_mondego wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow and slowly entered the arbor whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to his senses and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted body good day said he you called me didnâ you and he fell rather than sat down on one of the seats which surrounded the table i called you because you were running like a madman and i was afraid you would throw yourself into the sea said m_caderousse laughing why when a man has friend they are not only to offer him a glass of wine but moreover to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of water unnecessarily m_fernand_mondego gave a groan which resembled a sob and dropped his head into his hand his elbows leaning on the table well m_fernand_mondego i must say said m_caderousse beginning the conversation with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity destroys all diplomacy you look uncommonly like a rejected lover and he burst into a hoarse laugh bah said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in love you are laughing at him m_caderousse â no he replied only hark how he sighs come come m_fernand_mondego said m_caderousse hold up your head and answer us itâ not polite not to reply to friend who ask news of your health â my health is well enough said m_fernand_mondego clenching his hand without raising his head
â ah you see mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars said m_caderousse winking at his friend this is how it is m_fernand_mondego whom you see here is a good and brave catalan one of the best fishermen in marseilles and he is in love with a very fine girl named mercã_dã_s but it appears unfortunately that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the pharaon and as the pharaon arrived todayâ why you understand â no i do not understand said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars poor m_fernand_mondego has been dismissed continued m_caderousse well and what then said m_fernand_mondego lifting up his head and looking at m_caderousse like a man who look for someone on whom to vent his anger mercã_dã_s is not accountable to any person is she is she not free to love whomsoever she will â_oh if you take it in that sense said m_caderousse â_it is another thing but i thought you were a catalan and they told me the catalans were not man to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival it was even told me that m_fernand_mondego especially was terrible in his vengeance m_fernand_mondego smiled piteously a lover is never terrible he said poor fellow remarked mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his heart why you see he did not expect to see edmond_dantã_s return so suddenlyâ he thought he was dead perhaps or perchance faithless these thing always come on us more severely when they come suddenly â ah ma foi under any circumstances said m_caderousse who drank as he spoke and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take effect â under any circumstances m_fernand_mondego is not the only person put out by the fortunate arrival of edmond_dantã_s is he mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â no you are rightâ and
i should say that would bring him ill luck â well never mind answered m_caderousse pouring out a glass of wine for m_fernand_mondego and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time while mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had merely sipped his never mindâ in the meantime he marries mercã dã sâ the lovely mercã dã sâ at least he returns to do that during this time mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man on whose heart caderousseâ word fell like molten lead and when is the wedding to be he asked â_oh it is not yet fixed murmured m_fernand_mondego no but it will be said m_caderousse as surely as edmond_dantã_s will be captain of the pharaon eh mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack and turned to m_caderousse whose countenance he scrutinized to try and detect whether the blow was premeditated but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness well said he filling the glass let us drink to captain edmond_dantã_s husband of the beautiful catalane m_caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand and swallowed the contents at a gulp m_fernand_mondego dashed his on the ground eh eh eh stammered m_caderousse what do i see down there by the wall in the direction of the catalans look m_fernand_mondego your eye are better than mine i believe i see double you know wine is a deceiver but i should say it was two lovers walking side by side and hand in hand heaven forgive me they do not know that we can see them and they are actually embracing mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars did not lose one pang that m_fernand_mondego endured do you know them m_fernand_mondego he said â_yes was the reply in a low voice
â it is edmond_dantã_s and mercã_dã_s â ah see there now said m_caderousse and i did not recognize them hallo edmond_dantã_s hello lovely damsel come this way and let us know when the wedding is to be for m_fernand_mondego here is so obstinate he will not tell us â hold your tongue will you said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars pretending to restrain m_caderousse who with the tenacity of drunkards leaned out of the arbor try to stand upright and let the lovers make love without interruption see look at m_fernand_mondego and follow his example he is well behaved 0051m m_fernand_mondego probably excited beyond bearing pricked by mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars as the bull is by the bandilleros was about to rush out for he had risen from his seat and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival when mercã_dã_s smiling and graceful lifted up her lovely head and looked at them with her clear and bright eye at this m_fernand_mondego recollected her threat of dying if edmond_dantã_s died and dropped again heavily on his seat mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars looked at the two man one after the other the one brutalized by liquor the other overwhelmed with love i shall get nothing from these fools he muttered and i am very much afraid of being here between a drunkard and a coward hereâ an envious fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing his wrath and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from under his nose and takes on like a big baby yet this catalan has eye that glisten like those of the vengeful spaniards sicilians and calabrians and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one blow
unquestionably edmondâ star is in the ascendant and he will marry the splendid girlâ he will be captain too and laugh at us all unlessâ a sinister smile passed over danglarsâ lipsâ unless i take a hand in the affair he added hallo continued m_caderousse half rising and with his fist on the table hallo edmond_dantã_s do you not see your friend or are you too proud to speak to them â no my dear fellow replied edmond_dantã_s i am not proud but i am happy and happiness blinds i think more than pride â ah very well thatâ an explanation said m_caderousse how do you do madame edmond_dantã_s mercã_dã_s courtesied gravely and saidâ that is not my name and in my country it bodes ill fortune they say to call a young girl by the name of her betrothed before he becomes her husband so call me mercã_dã_s if you please â we must excuse our worthy neighbor m_caderousse said edmond_dantã_s he is so easily mistaken â so then the wedding is to take place immediately edmond_dantã_s said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars bowing to the young couple as soon as possible mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars today all preliminaries will be arranged at my fatherâ and tomorrow or next day at latest the wedding festival here at la rã serve my friend will be there i hope that is to say you are invited mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and you m_caderousse â and m_fernand_mondego said m_caderousse with a chuckle m_fernand_mondego too is invited â my wifeâ brother is my brother said edmond_dantã_s and we mercã_dã_s and i should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time m_fernand_mondego opened his mouth to reply but his voice died on his lip and he could not utter a word today the preliminaries tomorrow or next day the ceremony
you are in a hurry captain â mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars said edmond_dantã_s smiling i will say to you as mercã_dã_s said just now to m_caderousse do not give me a title which does not belong to meâ that may bring me bad luck â your pardon replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i merely said you seemed in a hurry and we have lots of time the pharaon cannot be under weigh again in less than three month â we are always in a hurry to be happy mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars for when we have suffered a long time we have great difficulty in believing in good fortune but it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste i must go to paris â ah really to paris and will it be the first time you have ever been there edmond_dantã_s â_yes â have you business there â not of my own the last commission of poor captain leclere you know to what i allude danglarsâ it is sacred besides i shall only take the time to go and return â_yes yes i understand said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and then in a low tone he added to paris no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave him ah this letter gives me an ideaâ a capital idea ah edmond_dantã_s my friend you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship pharaon then turning towards edmond_dantã_s who was walking away a pleasant journey he cried thank you said edmond_dantã_s with a friendly nod and the two lovers continued on their way as calm and joyous as if they were the very elect of heaven chapter
conspiracy mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars followed edmond_dantã_s and mercã_dã_s with his eye until the two lovers disappeared behind one of the angles of fort saint nicolas then turning round he perceived m_fernand_mondego who had fallen pale and trembling into his chair while m_caderousse stammered out the word of a drinking song well my dear sir said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars to m_fernand_mondego here is a marriage which does not appear to make everybody happy â_it drives me to despair said m_fernand_mondego do you then love mercã_dã_s â i adore her â for long â as long as i have known herâ always â and you sit there tearing your hair instead of seeking to remedy your condition i did not think that was the way of your people â what would you have me do said m_fernand_mondego how do i know is it my affair i am not in love with mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mercã_dã_s but for youâ in the word of the gospel seek and you shall find â i have found already â what â i would stab the man but the woman told me that if any misfortune happened to her betrothed she would kill herself â pooh woman say those thing but never do them â you do not know mercã_dã_s what she threatens she will do â idiot muttered mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars whether she kill herself or not what matter provided edmond_dantã_s is not captain â before mercã_dã_s should die replied m_fernand_mondego with the accents of unshaken resolution i would die myself â thatâ what i call love said m_caderousse with a voice more tipsy than ever thatâ love or i donâ know what love is â come said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars you appear to me a good sort of fellow and hang me i should like to help you butâ â â_yes said m_caderousse but how â my

â let him run on said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars restraining the young man drunk as he is he is not much out in what he says absence severs as well as death and if the wall of a prison were between edmond_dantã_s and mercã_dã_s they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone 0056m â_yes but one gets out of prison said m_caderousse who with what sense was left him listened eagerly to the conversation and when one gets out and oneâ name is edmond_dantã_s one seeks revengeâ â what matters that muttered m_fernand_mondego and why i should like to know persisted m_caderousse should they put edmond_dantã_s in prison he has neither robbed nor killed nor murdered â hold your tongue said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i wonâ hold my tongue replied m_caderousse i say i want to know why they should put edmond_dantã_s in prison i like edmond_dantã_s dantã your health and he swallowed another glass of wine 0057 mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication and turning towards m_fernand_mondego said well you understand there is no need to kill him â certainly not if as you said just now you have the means of having edmond_dantã_s arrested have you that means â_it is to be found for the searching but why should i meddle in the matter it is no affair of mine â i know not why you meddle said m_fernand_mondego seizing his arm but this i know you have some motive of personal hatred against edmond_dantã_s for he who himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of others â i motives of hatred against edmond_dantã_s none on my word
i saw you were unhappy and your unhappiness interested me thatâ all but since you believe i act for my own account adieu my dear friend get out of the affair as best you may and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars rose as if he meant to depart no no said m_fernand_mondego restraining him stay it is of very little consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry feeling or not against edmond_dantã_s i hate him i confess it openly do you find the means i will execute it provided it is not to kill the man for mercã_dã_s has declared she will kill herself if edmond_dantã_s is killed m_caderousse who had let his head drop on the table now raised it and looking at m_fernand_mondego with his dull and fishy eye he said kill edmond_dantã_s who talks of killing edmond_dantã_s i wonâ have him killedâ i wonâ heâ my friend and this morning offered to share his money with me as i shared mine with him i wonâ have edmond_dantã_s killedâ i wonâ â and who has said a word about killing him muddlehead replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars we were merely joking drink to his health he added filling caderousseâ glass and do not interfere with us â_yes yes dantã sâ good health said m_caderousse emptying his glass hereâ to his health his healthâ hurrah â but the meansâ the means said m_fernand_mondego have you not hit upon any asked mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars no you undertook to do so â true replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars the french have the superiority over the spaniards that the spaniards ruminate while the french invent â do you invent then said m_fernand_mondego impatiently waiter said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars pen ink and paper â pen ink and paper muttered m_fernand_mondego
â yes i am a supercargo pen ink and paper are my tools and without my tools i am fit for nothing â pen ink and paper then called m_fernand_mondego loudly thereâ what you want on that table said the waiter bring them here the waiter did as he was desired 0059 â when one thinks said m_caderousse letting his hand drop on the paper there is here wherewithal to kill a man more sure than if we waited at the corner of a wood to assassinate him i have always had more dread of a pen a bottle of ink and a sheet of paper than of a sword or pistol â the fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars give him some more wine m_fernand_mondego m_fernand_mondego filled caderousseâ glass who like the confirmed toper he was lifted his hand from the paper and seized the glass the catalan watched him until m_caderousse almost overcome by this fresh assault on his senses rested or rather dropped his glass upon the table well resumed the catalan as he saw the final glimmer of caderousseâ reason vanishing before the last glass of wine well then i should say for instance resumed mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars that if after a voyage such as edmond_dantã_s has just made in which he touched at the island of elba someone were to denounce him to the kingâ procureur as a bonapartist agentâ â i will denounce him exclaimed the young man hastily â_yes but they will make you then sign your declaration and confront you with him you have denounced i will supply you with the means of supporting your accusation for i know the fact well
but edmond_dantã_s cannot remain forever in prison and one day or other he will leave it and the day when he comes out woe betide him who was the cause of his incarceration â_oh i should wish nothing better than that he would come and seek a quarrel with me â_yes and mercã_dã_s mercã dã who will detest you if you have only the misfortune to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved edmond_dantã_s â true said m_fernand_mondego no no continued mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars if we resolve on such a step it would be much better to take as i now do this pen dip it into this ink and write with the left hand that the writing may not be recognized the denunciation we propose and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars uniting practice with theory wrote with his left hand and in a writing reversed from his usual style and totally unlike it the following lines which he handed to m_fernand_mondego and which m_fernand_mondego read in an undertone the honorable the kingâ attorney is informed by a friend of the throne and religion that one edmond_dantã_s mate of the ship pharaon arrived this morning from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been intrusted by murat with a letter for the usurper and by the usurper with a letter for the bonapartist committee in paris proof of this crime will be found on arresting him for the letter will be found upon him or at his fatherâ or in his cabin on board the pharaon â very good resumed mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars now your revenge look like common sense for in no way
can it revert to yourself and the matter will thus work its own way there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as i am doing and write upon it to the kingâ attorney and thatâ all settled and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars wrote the address as he spoke â_yes and thatâ all settled exclaimed m_caderousse who by a last effort of intellect had followed the reading of the letter and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must entail â_yes and thatâ all settled only it will be an infamous shame and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter â_yes said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars taking it from beyond his reach and as what i say and do is merely in jest and i amongst the first and foremost should be sorry if anything happened to dantã sâ the worthy dantã sâ look here and taking the letter he squeezed it up in his hand and threw it into a corner of the arbor all right said m_caderousse edmond_dantã_s is my friend and i wonâ have him ill used â and who thinks of using him ill certainly neither i nor m_fernand_mondego said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars rising and looking at the young man who still remained seated but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung into the corner in this case replied m_caderousse letâ have some more wine i wish to drink to the health of edmond_dantã_s and the lovely mercã_dã_s â you have had too much already drunkard said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and if you continue you will be compelled to sleep here because unable to stand on your legs â i said m_caderousse rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken man i canâ keep on my legs
why iâ ll wager i can go up into the belfry of the accoules and without staggering too â done said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars iâ ll take your bet but tomorrowâ today it is time to return give me your arm and let us go â very well let us go said m_caderousse but i donâ want your arm at all come m_fernand_mondego wonâ you return to marseilles with us â no said m_fernand_mondego i shall return to the catalans â youâ re wrong come with us to marseillesâ come along â i will not â what do you mean you will not well just as you like my prince thereâ liberty for all the world come along mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and let the young gentleman return to the catalans if he chooses mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars took advantage of caderousseâ temper at the moment to take him off towards marseilles by the porte saint victor staggering as he went when they had advanced about twenty yards mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars looked back and saw m_fernand_mondego stoop pick up the crumpled paper and putting it into his pocket then rush out of the arbor towards pillon well said m_caderousse why what a lie he told he said he was going to the catalans and he is going to the city hallo m_fernand_mondego you are coming my boy â_oh you donâ see straight said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars heâ gone right by the road to the vieilles infirmeries â well said m_caderousse i should have sworn that he turned to the rightâ how treacherous wine is â come come said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars to himself now the thing is at work and it will effect its purpose unassisted chapter the marriage feast the morningâ sun rose clear and resplendent touching the foamy waves into a network of ruby tinted light the feast had been made ready on the second floor at la rã serve with whose arbor the reader is already familiar
the apartment destined for the purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of window over each of which was written in golden letter for some inexplicable reason the name of one of the principal cities of france beneath these window a wooden balcony extended the entire length of the house_of_peers and although the entertainment was fixed for twelve oâ clock an hour previous to that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests consisting of the favored part of the crew of the pharaon and other personal friend of the bridegroom the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest costumes in order to do greater honor to the occasion various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the pharaon had promised to attend the nuptial feast but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be intended mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars however who now made his appearance accompanied by m_caderousse effectually confirmed the report stating that he had recently conversed with m_maximilian_morrel who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at la rã serve in fact a moment later m_maximilian_morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the pharaon who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship and as edmond_dantã_s was universally beloved on board his vessel the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own
with the entrance of m_maximilian_morrel mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and m_caderousse were despatched in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively sensation and to beseech him to make haste mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and m_caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed but ere they had gone many step they perceived a group advancing towards them composed of the betrothed pair a party of young girl in attendance on the bride by whose side walked dantã sâ father the whole brought up by m_fernand_mondego whose lip wore their usual sinister smile neither mercã_dã_s nor edmond_dantã_s observed the strange expression of his countenance they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each other having acquitted themselves of their errand and exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with edmond_dantã_s mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and m_caderousse took their place beside m_fernand_mondego and old edmond_dantã_s the latter of whom attracted universal notice the old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk trimmed with steel buttons beautifully cut and polished his thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings evidently of english manufacture while from his three cornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons thus he came along supporting himself on a curiously carved stick his aged countenance lit up with happiness looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of 1796 parading the newly opened gardens of the luxembourg and tuileries
beside him glided m_caderousse whose desire to partake of the good thing provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the edmond_dantã_s father and son although there still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream 0065 as mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars approached the disappointed lover he cast on him a look of deep meaning while m_fernand_mondego as he slowly paced behind the happy pair who seemed in their own unmixed content to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed was pale and abstracted occasionally however a deep flush would overspread his countenance and a nervous contraction distort his features while with an agitated and restless gaze he would glance in the direction of marseilles like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event edmond_dantã_s himself was simply but becomingly clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant serviceâ a costume somewhat between a military and a civil garb and with his fine countenance radiant with joy and happiness a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined lovely as the greek girl of cyprus or chios mercã_dã_s boasted the same bright flashing eye of jet and ripe round coral lip she moved with the light free step of an arlesienne or an andalusian one more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil or at least have cast down her thickly fringed lashes so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eye but on the contrary the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say if
you are my friend rejoice with me for i am very happy as soon as the bridal party came in sight of la rã serve m_maximilian_morrel descended and came forth to meet it followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled to whom he had repeated the promise already given that edmond_dantã_s should be the successor to the late captain leclere edmond_dantã_s at the approach of his patron respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of m_maximilian_morrel who forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden step leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared was gayly followed by the guests beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minute father said mercã_dã_s stopping when she had reached the centre of the table sit i pray you on my right hand on my left i will place him who has ever been as a brother to me pointing with a soft and gentle smile to m_fernand_mondego but her word and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him for his lip became ghastly pale and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart during this time edmond_dantã_s at the opposite side of the table had been occupied in similarly placing his most honored guests m_maximilian_morrel was seated at his right hand mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars at his left while at a sign from edmond_dantã_s the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most agreeable
then they began to pass around the dusky piquant arlesian sausages and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses prawns of large size and brilliant color the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel within the clovis esteemed by the epicures of the south as more than rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster north all the delicacies in fact that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach and styled by the grateful fishermen fruits of the sea â a pretty silence truly said the old father of the bridegroom as he carried to his lip a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz and which had just been placed before mercã_dã_s herself now would anybody think that this room contained a happy merry party who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hour away â ah sighed m_caderousse a man cannot always feel happy because he is about to be married â the truth is replied edmond_dantã_s that i am too happy for noisy mirth if that is what you meant by your observation my worthy friend you are right joy takes a strange effect at time it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars looked towards m_fernand_mondego whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression why what ails you asked he of edmond_dantã_s do you fear any approaching evil i should say that you were the happiest man alive at this instant â and that is the very thing that alarms me returned edmond_dantã_s
â man does not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed happiness is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood where fierce fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach and monsters of all shapes and kinds requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours i own that i am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which i feel myself unworthyâ that of being the husband of mercã_dã_s â nay nay cried m_caderousse smiling you have not attained that honor yet mercã_dã_s is not yet your wife just assume the tone and manner of a husband and see how she will remind you that your hour is not yet come the bride blushed while m_fernand_mondego restless and uneasy seemed to start at every fresh sound and from time to time wiped away the large drops of perspiration that gathered on his brow well never mind that neighbor m_caderousse it is not worthwhile to contradict me for such a trifle as that tis true that mercã_dã_s is not actually my wife but added he drawing out his watch in an hour and a half she will be a general exclamation of surprise ran round the table with the exception of the elder edmond_dantã_s whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his large white teeth mercã_dã_s looked pleased and gratified while m_fernand_mondego grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch in an hour inquired mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars turning pale how is that my friend â why thus it is replied edmond_dantã_s thanks to the influence of m_maximilian_morrel to whom next to my father i owe every blessing i enjoy every difficulty has been removed
we have purchased permission to waive the usual delay and at half past two oâ clock the mayor of marseilles will be waiting for us at the city hall now as a quarter past one has already struck i do not consider i have asserted too much in saying that in another hour and thirty minute mercã_dã_s will have become madame edmond_dantã_s 0069m m_fernand_mondego closed his eye a burning sensation passed across his brow and he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling from his chair but in spite of all his efforts he could not refrain from uttering a deep groan which however was lost amid the noisy felicitations of the company upon my word cried the old man you make short work of this kind of affair arrived here only yesterday morning and married today at three oâ clock commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work â but asked mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars in a timid tone how did you manage about the other formalitiesâ the contractâ the settlement â the contract answered edmond_dantã_s laughingly â_it didnâ take long to fix that mercã_dã_s has no fortune i have none to settle on her so you see our paper were quickly written out and certainly do not come very expensive this joke elicited a fresh burst of applause so that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to be the actual wedding dinner said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars no no answered edmond_dantã_s donâ imagine i am going to put you off in that shabby manner tomorrow morning i start for paris four day to go and the same to return with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me is all the time i shall be absent
i shall be back here by the first of march and on the second i give my real marriage feast this prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree that the elder edmond_dantã_s who at the commencement of the repast had commented upon the silence that prevailed now found it difficult amid the general din of voice to obtain a momentâ tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom edmond_dantã_s perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father responded by a look of grateful pleasure while mercã_dã_s glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to edmond_dantã_s around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of etiquette such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously and sought out more agreeable companions everybody talked at once without waiting for a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own thoughts fernandâ paleness appeared to have communicated itself to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars as for m_fernand_mondego himself he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned unable to rest he was among the first to quit the table and as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds he continued in utter silence to pace the farther end of the salon m_caderousse approached him just as mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars whom m_fernand_mondego seemed most anxious to avoid had joined him in a corner of the room
â upon my word said m_caderousse from whose mind the friendly treatment of edmond_dantã_s united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken of had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at dantã sâ good fortune â upon my word edmond_dantã_s is a downright good fellow and when i see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be i cannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday â_oh there was no harm meant answered mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars at first i certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what m_fernand_mondego might be tempted to do but when i saw how completely he had mastered his feelings even so far as to become one of his rivalâ attendants i knew there was no further cause for apprehension m_caderousse looked full at fernandâ he was ghastly pale certainly continued mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars the sacrifice was no trifling one when the beauty of the bride is concerned upon my soul that future captain of mine is a lucky dog gad i only wish he would let me take his place â shall we not set forth asked the sweet silvery voice of mercã_dã_s two oâ clock has just struck and you know we are expected in a quarter of an hour 0071m to be sure to be sure cried edmond_dantã_s eagerly quitting the table let us go directly his word were re echoed by the whole party with vociferous cheers at this moment mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who had been incessantly observing every change in fernandâ look and manner saw him stagger and fall back with an almost convulsive spasm against a seat placed near one of the open window
at the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs followed by the measured tread of soldiery with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements then came a hum and buzz as of many voice so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed the sounds drew nearer three blows were struck upon the panel of the door the company looked at each other in consternation i demand admittance said a loud voice outside the room in the name of the law as no attempt was made to prevent it the door was opened and a magistrate wearing his official scarf presented himself followed by four soldiers and a corporal uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present may i venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit said m_maximilian_morrel addressing the magistrate whom he evidently knew there is doubtless some mistake easily explained â if it be so replied the magistrate rely upon every reparation being made meanwhile i am the bearer of an order of arrest and although i most reluctantly perform the task assigned me it must nevertheless be fulfilled who among the person here assembled answers to the name of edmond_dantã_s
every eye was turned towards the young man who spite of the agitation he could not but feel advanced with dignity and said in a firm voice i am he what is your pleasure with me â edmond_dantã_s replied the magistrate i arrest you in the name of the law â me repeated edmond_dantã_s slightly changing color and wherefore i pray â i cannot inform you but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination m_maximilian_morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless he saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy old edmond_dantã_s however sprang forward there are situations which the heart of a father or a mother cannot be made to understand he prayed and supplicated in terms so moving that even the officer was touched and although firm in his duty he kindly said my worthy friend let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his freight â what is the meaning of all this inquired m_caderousse frowningly of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who had assumed an air of utter surprise 0073
m how can i tell you replied he i am like yourself utterly bewildered at all that is going on and cannot in the least make out what it is about m_caderousse then looked around for m_fernand_mondego but he had disappeared the scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness the painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory so so said he in a hoarse and choking voice to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars this then i suppose is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday all i can say is that if it be so tis an ill turn and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it â nonsense returned mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i tell you again i have nothing whatever to do with it besides you know very well that i tore the paper to pieces â no you did not answered m_caderousse you merely threw it byâ i saw it lying in a corner â hold your tongue you fool what should you know about it why you were drunk â where is m_fernand_mondego inquired m_caderousse how do i know replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars gone as every prudent man ought to be to look after his own affairs most likely never mind where he is let you and i go and see what is to be done for our poor friend
during this conversation edmond_dantã_s after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friend had surrendered himself to the officer sent to arrest him merely saying make yourselves quite easy my good fellows there is some little mistake to clear up thatâ all depend upon it and very likely i may not have to go so far as the prison to effect that 0075m â_oh to be sure responded mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who had now approached the group nothing more than a mistake i feel quite certain edmond_dantã_s descended the staircase preceded by the magistrate and followed by the soldiers a carriage awaited him at the door he got in followed by two soldiers and the magistrate and the vehicle drove off towards marseilles adieu adieu dearest edmond_dantã_s cried mercã_dã_s stretching out her arm to him from the balcony the prisoner heard the cry which sounded like the sob of a broken heart and leaning from the coach he called out good bye mercã dã sâ we shall soon meet again then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of fort saint nicholas wait for me here all of you cried m_maximilian_morrel i will take the first conveyance i find and hurry to marseilles whence i will bring you word how all is going on â thatâ right exclaimed a multitude of voice go and return as quickly as you can this second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind the old father and mercã_dã_s remained for some time apart each absorbed in grief but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eye and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each otherâ arm
meanwhile m_fernand_mondego made his appearance poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand then hastily swallowing it went to sit down at the first vacant place and this was by mere chance placed next to the seat on which poor mercã_dã_s had fallen half fainting when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old edmond_dantã_s instinctively m_fernand_mondego drew back his chair he is the cause of all this miseryâ i am quite sure of it whispered m_caderousse who had never taken his eye off m_fernand_mondego to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i donâ think so answered the other heâ too stupid to imagine such a scheme i only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it â you donâ mention those who aided and abetted the deed said m_caderousse surely answered mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars one cannot be held responsible for every chance arrow shot into the air â you can indeed when the arrow light point downward on somebodyâ head meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different form what think you mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars said one of the party turning towards him of this event â why replied he i think it just possible edmond_dantã_s may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband â but how could he have done so without your knowledge mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars since you are the shipâ supercargo â why as for that i could only know what i was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden i know she was loaded with cotton and that she took in her freight at alexandria from pastretâ warehouse and at smyrna from pascalâ that is all i was obliged to know and i beg i may not be asked for any further particulars â now
i recollect said the afflicted old father my poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee and another of tobacco for me â there you see exclaimed mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars now the mischief is out depend upon it the custom house_of_peers people went rummaging about the ship in our absence and discovered poor dantã sâ hidden treasures mercã_dã_s however paid no heed to this explanation of her loverâ arrest her grief which she had hitherto tried to restrain now burst out in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing come come said the old man be comforted my poor child there is still hope â hope repeated mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars hope faintly murmured m_fernand_mondego but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitated lip and a convulsive spasm passed over his countenance good news good news shouted forth one of the party stationed in the balcony on the lookout here comes m_maximilian_morrel back no doubt now we shall hear that our friend is released mercã_dã_s and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door he was very pale what news exclaimed a general burst of voice alas my friend replied m_maximilian_morrel with a mournful shake of his head the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than i expected â_oh indeedâ indeed sir he is innocent sobbed forth mercã_dã_s that i believe answered m_maximilian_morrel but still he is chargedâ â with what inquired the elder edmond_dantã_s with being an agent of the bonapartist faction many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is dated a despairing cry escaped the pale lip of mercã_dã_s the old man sank into a chair
â ah mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars whispered m_caderousse you have deceived meâ the trick you spoke of last night has been played but i cannot suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault i am determined to tell them all about it â be silent you simpleton cried mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars grasping him by the arm or i will not answer even for your own safety who can tell whether edmond_dantã_s be innocent or guilty the vessel did touch at elba where he quitted it and passed a whole day in the island now should any letter or other documents of a compromising character be found upon him will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his accomplices with the rapid instinct of selfishness m_caderousse readily perceived the solidity of this mode of reasoning he gazed doubtfully wistfully on mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and then caution supplanted generosity suppose we wait a while and see what comes of it said he casting a bewildered look on his companion to be sure answered mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars let us wait by all means if he be innocent of course he will be set at liberty if guilty why it is no use involving ourselves in a conspiracy â let us go then i cannot stay here any longer â with all my heart replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars pleased to find the other so tractable let us take ourselves out of the way and leave thing for the present to take their course after their departure m_fernand_mondego who had now again become the friend and protector of mercã_dã_s led the girl to her home while some friend of edmond_dantã_s conducted his father nearly lifeless to the allã es de meilhan the rumor of edmondâ arrest as a bonapartist agent was not slow in circulating throughout the city
â could you ever have credited such a thing my dear mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars asked m_maximilian_morrel as on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh tidings of edmond_dantã_s from m_noirtier_de_villefort the assistant procureur he overtook his supercargo and m_caderousse could you have believed such a thing possible â why you know i told you replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars that i considered the circumstance of his having anchored at the island of elba as a very suspicious circumstance â and did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself 0079 â certainly not returned mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars then added in a low whisper you understand that on account of your uncle policar m_maximilian_morrel who served under the other government and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of napoleon i should have feared to injure both edmond_dantã_s and yourself had i divulged my own apprehensions to a soul i am too well aware that though a subordinate like myself is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs there are many thing he ought most carefully to conceal from all else â tis well danglarsâ tis well replied m_maximilian_morrel you are a worthy fellow and i had already thought of your interests in the event of poor edmond_dantã_s having become captain of the pharaon â is it possible you were so kind â_yes indeed i had previously inquired of edmond_dantã_s what was his opinion of you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post for somehow i have perceived a sort of coolness between you â and
what was his reply â that he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the shipâ owners would have his preference also â the hypocrite murmured mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars poor edmond_dantã_s said m_caderousse no one can deny his being a noble hearted young fellow â but meanwhile continued m_maximilian_morrel here is the pharaon without a captain â_oh replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars since we cannot leave this port for the next three month let us hope that ere the expiration of that period edmond_dantã_s will be set at liberty â no doubt but in the meantime â i am entirely at your service m_maximilian_morrel answered mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars you know that i am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services that upon edmondâ release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the pharaon than for edmond_dantã_s and myself each to resume our respective posts â thanks danglarsâ that will smooth over all difficulties i fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the pharaon and look carefully to the unloading of her freight private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with business â be easy on that score m_maximilian_morrel but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor edmond_dantã_s â i will let you know that directly i have seen m_noirtier_de_villefort whom i shall endeavor to interest in edmondâ favor
i am aware he is a furious royalist but in spite of that and of his being kingâ attorney he is a man like ourselves and i fancy not a bad sort of one â perhaps not replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars but i hear that he is ambitious and thatâ rather against him â well well returned m_maximilian_morrel we shall see but now hasten on board i will join you there ere long so saying the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies and proceeded in the direction of the palais de justice 0081 â you see said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars addressing m_caderousse the turn thing have taken do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence â not the slightest but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such consequences â but who perpetrated that joke let me ask neither you nor myself but m_fernand_mondego you knew very well that i threw the paper into a corner of the roomâ indeed i fancied i had destroyed it â_oh no replied m_caderousse that i can answer for you did not i only wish i could see it now as plainly as i saw it lying all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the arbor â well then if you did depend upon it m_fernand_mondego picked it up and either copied it or caused it to be copied perhaps even he did not take the trouble of recopying it and now i think of it by heavens he may have sent the letter itself fortunately for me the handwriting was disguised â then you were aware of edmond_dantã_s being engaged in a conspiracy â not i as i before said i thought the whole thing was a joke nothing more
it seems however that i have unconsciously stumbled upon the truth â still argued m_caderousse i would give a great deal if nothing of the kind had happened or at least that i had had no hand in it you will see mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us â nonsense if any harm come of it it should fall on the guilty person and that you know is m_fernand_mondego how can we be implicated in any way all we have got to do is to keep our own counsel and remain perfectly quiet not breathing a word to any living soul and you will see that the storm will pass away without in the least affecting us â amen responded m_caderousse waving his hand in token of adieu to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and bending his step towards the allã es de meilhan moving his head to and fro and muttering as he went after the manner of one whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea so far then said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mentally all has gone as i would have it i am temporarily commander of the pharaon with the certainty of being permanently so if that fool of a m_caderousse can be persuaded to hold his tongue my only fear is the chance of edmond_dantã_s being released but there he is in the hand of justice and added he with a smile she will take her own so saying he leaped into a boat desiring to be rowed on board the pharaon where m_maximilian_morrel had agreed to meet him chapter the deputy procureur du roi
in one of the aristocratic mansions built by puget in the rue du grand cours opposite the medusa fountain a second marriage feast was being celebrated almost at the same hour with the nuptial repast given by edmond_dantã_s in this case however although the occasion of the entertainment was similar the company was strikingly dissimilar instead of a rude mixture of sailors soldiers and those belonging to the humblest grade of life the present assembly was composed of the very flower of marseilles society magistrates who had resigned their office during the usurperâ reign officers who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with condã and younger members of families brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five year of exile would convert into a martyr and fifteen of restoration elevate to the rank of a god the guests were still at table and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the south where unhappily for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling the emperor now king of the petty island of elba after having held sovereign sway over one half of the world counting as his subjects a small population of five or six thousand souls after having been accustomed to hear the vive napolã ons of a hundred and twenty millions of human beings uttered in ten different languages was looked upon here as a ruined man separated forever from any fresh connection with france or claim to her throne the magistrates freely discussed their political views the military part of the company talked unreservedly of moscow and leipsic while the woman commented on the divorce of josephine
it was not over the downfall of the man but over the defeat of the napoleonic idea that they rejoiced and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a revivified political existence an old man decorated with the cross of saint louis_xviii now rose and proposed the health of king louis_xviii it was the marquis de madame_de_saint_mã_ran this toast recalling at once the patient exile of hartwell and the peace loving king of france excited universal enthusiasm glass were elevated in the air lâ anglaise and the ladies snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms strewed the table with their floral treasures in a word an almost poetical fervor prevailed ah said the marquise de madame_de_saint_mã_ran a woman with a stern forbidding eye though still noble and distinguished in appearance despite her fifty yearsâ ah these revolutionists who have driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the reign of terror would be compelled to own were they here that all true devotion was on our side since we were content to follow the fortune of a falling monarch while they on the contrary made their fortune by worshipping the rising sun yes yes they could not help admitting that the king for whom we sacrificed rank wealth and station was truly our louis_xviii the well beloved while their wretched usurper has been and ever will be to them their evil genius their napoleon the accursed am i not right m_noirtier_de_villefort â i beg your pardon madame i really must pray you to excuse me butâ in truthâ i was not attending to the conversation â marquise marquise interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the toast let the young people alone
let me tell you on oneâ wedding day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry politics â never mind dearest mother said a young and lovely girl with a profusion of light brown hair and eye that seemed to float in liquid crystal â tis all my fault for seizing upon m_noirtier_de_villefort so as to prevent his listening to what you said but thereâ now take himâ he is your own for as long as you like m_noirtier_de_villefort i beg to remind you my mother speaks to you â if the marquise will deign to repeat the word i but imperfectly caught i shall be delighted to answer said m_noirtier_de_villefort never mind renã_e replied the marquise with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features but however all other feelings may be withered in a womanâ nature there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart and that is the shrine of maternal love i forgive you what i was saying m_noirtier_de_villefort was that the bonapartists had not our sincerity enthusiasm or devotion â they had however what supplied the place of those fine qualities replied the young man and that was fanaticism napoleon is the mahomet of the west and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious followers not only as a leader and lawgiver but also as the personification of equality â he cried the marquise napoleon the type of equality for mercyâ sake then what would you call robespierre
come come do not strip the latter of his just rights to bestow them on the corsican who to my mind has usurped quite enough 0085m nay madame i would place each of these heroes on his right pedestalâ that of robespierre on his scaffold in the place louis_xviii quinze that of napoleon on the column of the place vendã me the only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two man one is the equality that elevates the other is the equality that degrades one brings a king within reach of the guillotine the other elevates the people to a level with the throne observe said m_noirtier_de_villefort smiling i do not mean to deny that both these man were revolutionary scoundrels and that the 9th thermidor and the 4th of april in the year 1814 were lucky day for france worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order and that explains how it comes to pass that fallen as i trust he is forever napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites still marquise it has been so with other usurpersâ cromwell for instance who was not half so bad as napoleon had his partisans and advocates â do you know m_noirtier_de_villefort that you are talking in a most dreadfully revolutionary strain but i excuse it it is impossible to expect the son of a girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven a deep crimson suffused the countenance of m_noirtier_de_villefort
â tis true madame answered he that my father was a girondin but he was not among the number of those who voted for the kingâ death he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the reign of terror and had well nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished â true replied the marquise without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up but bear in mind if you please that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles in proof of which i may remark that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes your father lost no time in joining the new government and that while the citizen m_noirtier_de_villefort was a girondin the count m_noirtier_de_villefort became a senator â dear mother interposed renã_e you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside â suffer me also madame replied m_noirtier_de_villefort to add my earnest request to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars de saint mã ranâ that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past what avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall for my own part i have laid aside even the name of my father and altogether disown his political principles he wasâ nay probably may still beâ a bonapartist and is called m_noirtier_de_villefort i on the contrary am a staunch royalist and style myself m_noirtier_de_villefort
let what may remain of revolutionary sap exhaust itself and die away with the old trunk and condescend only to regard the young shoot which has started up at a distance from the parent tree without having the power any more than the wish to separate entirely from the stock from which it sprung â bravo m_noirtier_de_villefort cried the marquis excellently well said come now i have hopes of obtaining what i have been for year endeavoring to persuade the marquise to promise namely a perfect amnesty and forgetfulness of the past â with all my heart replied the marquise let the past be forever forgotten i promise you it affords me as little pleasure to revive it as it does you all i ask is that m_noirtier_de_villefort will be firm and inflexible for the future in his political principles remember also m_noirtier_de_villefort that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your fealty and strict loyalty and that at our recommendation the king consented to forget the past as i doâ and here she extended to him her hand â as i now do at your entreaty but bear in mind that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the government you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment as it is known you belong to a suspected family â alas madame returned m_noirtier_de_villefort my profession as well as the time in which we live compels me to be severe i have already successfully conducted several public prosecutions and brought the offenders to merited punishment but we have not done with the thing yet 0087m do you indeed think so inquired the marquise i am at least fearful of it
napoleon in the island of elba is too near france and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans marseilles is filled with half pay officers who are daily under one frivolous pretext or other getting up quarrels with the royalists from hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of person and assassinations in the lower â you have heard perhaps said the comte de salvieux one of de saint mã ranâ oldest friend and chamberlain to the comte dâ artois that the holy alliance purpose removing him from thence â_yes they were talking about it when we left paris said de madame_de_saint_mã_ran and where is it decided to transfer him â to saint helena â for heavenâ sake where is that asked the marquise an island situated on the other side of the equator at least two thousand leagues from here replied the count so much the better as m_noirtier_de_villefort observes it is a great act of folly to have left such a man between corsica where he was born and naples of which his brother in law is king and face to face with italy the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son â unfortunately said m_noirtier_de_villefort there are the treaties of 1814 and we cannot molest napoleon without breaking those compacts â_oh well we shall find some way out of it responded de salvieux there wasnâ any trouble over treaties when it was a question of shooting the poor duc dâ enghien â well said the marquise â_it seems probable that by the aid of the holy alliance we shall be rid of napoleon and we must trust to the vigilance of m_noirtier_de_villefort to purify marseilles of his partisans
the king is either a king or no king if he be acknowledged as sovereign of france he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracyâ tis the best and surest means of preventing mischief â unfortunately madame answered m_noirtier_de_villefort the strong arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place â then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it â nay madame the law is frequently powerless to effect this all it can do is to avenge the wrong done â_oh m_noirtier_de_villefort cried a beautiful young creature daughter to the comte de salvieux and the cherished friend of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars de madame_de_saint_mã_ran do try and get up some famous trial while we are at marseilles i never was in a law court i am told it is so very amusing â amusing certainly replied the young man inasmuch as instead of shedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre you behold in a law court a case of real and genuine distressâ a drama of life the prisoner whom you there see pale agitated and alarmed instead ofâ as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedyâ going home to sup peacefully with his family and then retiring to rest that he may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow is removed from your sight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the executioner i leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a scene
of this however be assured that should any favorable opportunity present itself i will not fail to offer you the choice of being present â for shame m_noirtier_de_villefort said renã_e becoming quite pale donâ you see how you are frightening us and yet you laugh â what would you have tis like a duel i have already recorded sentence of death five or six time against the movers of political conspiracies and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart â gracious heavens m_noirtier_de_villefort said renã_e becoming more and more terrified you surely are not in earnest â indeed i am replied the young magistrate with a smile and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness the case would only be still more aggravated suppose for instance the prisoner as is more than probable to have served under napoleonâ well can you expect for an instant that one accustomed at the word of his commander to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy than to slaughter his fellow creatures merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey besides one requires the excitement of being hateful in the eye of the accused in order to lash oneâ self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power i would not choose to see the man against whom i pleaded smile as though in mockery of my word no my pride is to see the accused pale agitated and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence renã_e uttered a smothered exclamation
â bravo cried one of the guests that is what i call talking to some purpose â just the person we require at a time like the present said a second what a splendid business that last case of yours was my dear m_noirtier_de_villefort remarked a third i mean the trial of the man for murdering his father upon my word you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him â_oh as for parricides and such dreadful people as that interposed renã_e â_it matters very little what is done to them but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intriguesâ â why that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit for donâ you see renã_e the king is the father of his people and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirty two millions of souls is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale â i donâ know anything about that replied renã_e but m_noirtier_de_villefort you have promised meâ have you not always to show mercy to those i plead for â make yourself quite easy on that point answered m_noirtier_de_villefort with one of his sweetest smile you and i will always consult upon our verdicts â my love said the marquise attend to your doves your lap dogs and embroidery but do not meddle with what you do not understand nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the badge of honor there is a wise latin proverb that is very much in point â cedant arma togã said m_noirtier_de_villefort with a bow i cannot speak latin responded the marquise
â well said renã_e i cannot help regretting you had not chosen some other profession than your ownâ a physician for instance do you know i always felt a shudder at the idea of even a destroying angel â dear good renã_e whispered m_noirtier_de_villefort as he gazed with unutterable tenderness on the lovely speaker let us hope my child cried the marquis that m_noirtier_de_villefort may prove the moral and political physician of this province if so he will have achieved a noble work â and one which will go far to efface the recollection of his fatherâ conduct added the incorrigible marquise madame replied m_noirtier_de_villefort with a mournful smile i have already had the honor to observe that my father hasâ at least i hope soâ abjured his past errors and that he is at the present moment a firm and zealous friend to religion and orderâ a better royalist possibly than his son for he has to atone for past dereliction while i have no other impulse than warm decided preference and conviction having made this well turned speech m_noirtier_de_villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court do you know my dear m_noirtier_de_villefort cried the comte de salvieux that is exactly what i myself said the other day at the tuileries when questioned by his majestyâ principal chamberlain touching the singularity of an alliance between the son of a girondin and the daughter of an officer of the duc de condã and i assure you he seemed fully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences was based upon sound and excellent principles
then the king who without our suspecting it had overheard our conversation interrupted us by saying villefortâ observe that the king did not pronounce the word m_noirtier_de_villefort but on the contrary placed considerable emphasis on that of villefortâ m_noirtier_de_villefort said his majesty is a young man of great judgment and discretion who will be sure to make a figure in his profession i like him much and it gave me great pleasure to hear that he was about to become the son in law of the marquis and marquise de madame_de_saint_mã_ran i should myself have recommended the match had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it â is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me asked the enraptured m_noirtier_de_villefort i give you his very word and if the marquis chooses to be candid he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him when he went six month ago to consult him upon the subject of your espousing his daughter 0091m that is true answered the marquis how much do i owe this gracious prince what is there i would not do to evince my earnest gratitude â that is right cried the marquise i love to see you thus now then were a conspirator to fall into your hand he would be most welcome â for my part dear mother interposed renã_e i trust your wishes will not prosper and that providence will only permit petty offenders poor debtors and miserable cheats to fall into de villefortâ hands
then i shall be contented â just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be called upon to prescribe for headaches measles and the stings of wasps or any other slight affection of the epidermis if you wish to see me the kingâ attorney you must desire for me some of those violent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor redounds to the physician at this moment and as though the utterance of villefortâ wish had sufficed to effect its accomplishment a servant entered the room and whispered a few word in his ear m_noirtier_de_villefort immediately rose from table and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business he soon however returned his whole face beaming with delight renã_e regarded him with fond affection and certainly his handsome features lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover you were wishing just now said m_noirtier_de_villefort addressing her that i were a doctor instead of a lawyer well i at least resemble the disciples of esculapius in one thing people spoke in this style in 1815 that of not being able to call a day my own not even that of my betrothal â and wherefore were you called away just now asked mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars de madame_de_saint_mã_ran with an air of deep interest for a very serious matter which bids fair to make work for the executioner â how dreadful exclaimed renã_e turning pale is it possible burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his word why if my information prove correct a sort of bonapartist conspiracy has just been discovered â can i believe my ears cried the marquise
â i will read you the letter containing the accusation at least said m_noirtier_de_villefort â the kingâ attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious institutions of his country that one named edmond_dantã_s mate of the ship pharaon this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been the bearer of a letter from murat to the usurper and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above mentioned edmond_dantã_s who either carries the letter for paris about with him or has it at his fatherâ abode should it not be found in the possession of father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said edmond_dantã_s on board the pharaon â but said renã_e this letter which after all is but an anonymous scrawl is not even addressed to you but to the kingâ attorney 0093m true but that gentleman being absent his secretary by his order opened his letter thinking this one of importance he sent for me but not finding me took upon himself to give the necessary order for arresting the accused party â then the guilty person is absolutely in custody said the marquise nay dear mother say the accused person you know we cannot yet pronounce him guilty â he is in safe custody answered m_noirtier_de_villefort and rely upon it if the letter is found he will not be likely to be trusted abroad again unless he goes forth under the especial protection of the headsman â and where is the unfortunate being asked renã_e
â he is at my house_of_peers â come come my friend interrupted the marquise do not neglect your duty to linger with us you are the kingâ servant and must go wherever that service calls you â_oh m_noirtier_de_villefort cried renã_e clasping her hand and looking towards her lover with piteous earnestness be merciful on this the day of our betrothal the young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair pleader sat and leaning over her chair said tenderly to give you pleasure my sweet renã_e i promise to show all the lenity in my power but if the charges brought against this bonapartist hero prove correct why then you really must give me leave to order his head to be cut off renã_e shuddered at the word cut for the growth in question had a head never mind that foolish girl m_noirtier_de_villefort said the marquise she will soon get over these thing so saying madame_de_saint_mã_ran extended her dry bony hand to m_noirtier_de_villefort who while imprinting a son in lawâ respectful salute on it looked at renã_e as much as to say i must try and fancy tis your dear hand i kiss as it should have been â these are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal sighed poor renã_e upon my word child exclaimed the angry marquise your folly exceeds all bounds i should be glad to know what connection there can possibly be between your sickly sentimentality and the affairs of the state â_oh mother murmured renã_e nay madame i pray you pardon this little traitor
i promise you that to make up for her want of loyalty i will be most inflexibly severe then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed which seemed to say fear not for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with mercy and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return m_noirtier_de_villefort departed with paradise in his heart chapter the examination no sooner had m_noirtier_de_villefort left the salon than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hand now in spite of the nobility of his countenance the command of which like a finished actor he had carefully studied before the glass it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity except the recollection of the line of politics his father had adopted and which might interfere unless he acted with the greatest prudence with his own career gã rard m_noirtier_de_villefort was as happy as a man could be already rich he held a high official situation though only twenty seven he was about to marry a young and charming woman whom he loved not passionately but reasonably as became a deputy attorney of the king and besides her personal attractions which were very great mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars de saint mã ranâ family possessed considerable political influence which they would of course exert in his favor the dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns and he had besides the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her fatherâ death these considerations naturally gave m_noirtier_de_villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its contemplation at the door he met the commissary of police who was waiting for him
the sight of this officer recalled m_noirtier_de_villefort from the third heaven to earth he composed his face as we have before described and said i have read the letter sir and you have acted rightly in arresting this man now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the conspiracy â we know nothing as yet of the conspiracy monsieur_albert all the paper found have been sealed up and placed on your desk the prisoner himself is named edmond_dantã_s mate on board the three master the pharaon trading in cotton with alexandria and smyrna and belonging to m_maximilian_morrel son of marseilles â before he entered the merchant service had he ever served in the marines â_oh no monsieur_albert he is very young â how old â nineteen or twenty at the most at this moment and as m_noirtier_de_villefort had arrived at the corner of the rue des conseils a man who seemed to have been waiting for him approached it was m_maximilian_morrel ah m_noirtier_de_villefort cried he i am delighted to see you some of your people have committed the strangest mistakeâ they have just arrested edmond_dantã_s mate of my vessel â i know it monsieur_albert replied m_noirtier_de_villefort and i am now going to examine him â_oh said m_maximilian_morrel carried away by his friendship you do not know him and i do he is the most estimable the most trustworthy creature in the world and i will venture to say there is not a better seaman in all the merchant service oh m_noirtier_de_villefort i beseech your indulgence for him m_noirtier_de_villefort as we have seen belonged to the aristocratic party at marseilles m_maximilian_morrel to the plebeian the first was a royalist the other suspected of bonapartism
villefort looked disdainfully at m_maximilian_morrel and replied coldly you are aware monsieur_albert that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life and the best seaman in the merchant service and yet be politically speaking a great criminal is it not true the magistrate laid emphasis on these word as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself while his eye seemed to plunge into the heart of one who interceding for another had himself need of indulgence m_maximilian_morrel reddened for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics besides what edmond_dantã_s had told him of his interview with the grand marshal and what the emperor had said to him embarrassed him he replied however in a tone of deep interest i entreat you m_noirtier_de_villefort be as you always are kind and equitable and give him back to us soon this give us sounded revolutionary in the deputyâ ears ah ah murmured he is edmond_dantã_s then a member of some carbonari society that his protector thus employs the collective form he was if i recollect arrested in a tavern in company with a great many others then he added monsieur_albert you may rest assured i shall perform my duty impartially and that if he be innocent you shall not have appealed to me in vain should he however be guilty in this present epoch impunity would furnish a dangerous example and i must do my duty 0097m as he had now arrived at the door of his own house_of_peers which adjoined the palais de justice he entered after having coldly saluted the shipowner who stood as if petrified on the spot where m_noirtier_de_villefort had left him
the antechamber was full of police agents and gendarmes in the midst of whom carefully watched but calm and smiling stood the prisoner m_noirtier_de_villefort traversed the antechamber cast a side glance at edmond_dantã_s and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him disappeared saying bring in the prisoner rapid as had been villefortâ glance it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrogate he had recognized intelligence in the high forehead courage in the dark eye and bent brow and frankness in the thick lip that showed a set of pearly teeth villefortâ first impression was favorable but he had been so often warned to mistrust first impulses that he applied the maxim to the impression forgetting the difference between the two word he stifled therefore the feelings of compassion that were rising composed his features and sat down grim and sombre at his desk an instant after edmond_dantã_s entered he was pale but calm and collected and saluting his judge with easy politeness looked round for a seat as if he had been in morrelâ salon it was then that he encountered for the first time villefortâ look that look peculiar to the magistrate who while seeming to read the thoughts of others betrays nothing of his own who and what are you demanded m_noirtier_de_villefort turning over a pile of paper containing information relative to the prisoner that a police agent had given to him on his entry and that already in an hourâ time had swelled to voluminous proportions thanks to the corrupt espionage of which the accusedâ is always made the victim my
name is edmond_dantã_s replied the young man calmly i am mate of the pharaon belonging to messrs m_maximilian_morrel son â your age continued m_noirtier_de_villefort nineteen returned edmond_dantã_s what were you doing at the moment you were arrested â i was at the festival of my marriage monsieur_albert said the young man his voice slightly tremulous so great was the contrast between that happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of m_noirtier_de_villefort and the radiant face of mercã_dã_s you were at the festival of your marriage said the deputy shuddering in spite of himself â_yes monsieur_albert i am on the point of marrying a young girl i have been attached to for three year m_noirtier_de_villefort impassive as he was was struck with this coincidence and the tremulous voice of edmond_dantã_s surprised in the midst of his happiness struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosomâ he also was on the point of being married and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another this philosophic reflection thought he will make a great sensation at de saint mã ranâ â and he arranged mentally while edmond_dantã_s awaited further questions the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence when this speech was arranged m_noirtier_de_villefort turned to edmond_dantã_s 0099 â go on sir said he what would you have me say â give all the information in your power â tell me on which point you desire information and i will tell all i know only added he with a smile i warn you i know very little â have you served under the usurper â i was about to be mustered into the royal marines when he fell â_it is reported your political opinions are extreme
said m_noirtier_de_villefort who had never heard anything of the kind but was not sorry to make this inquiry as if it were an accusation my political opinions replied edmond_dantã_s alas sir i never had any opinions i am hardly nineteen i know nothing i have no part to play if i obtain the situation i desire i shall owe it to m_maximilian_morrel thus all my opinionsâ i will not say public but privateâ are confined to these three sentiments i love my father i respect m_maximilian_morrel and i adore mercã_dã_s this sir is all i can tell you and you see how uninteresting it is as edmond_dantã_s spoke m_noirtier_de_villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance and recollected the word of renã_e who without knowing who the culprit was had besought his indulgence for him with the deputyâ knowledge of crime and criminals every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence this lad for he was scarcely a man simple natural eloquent with that eloquence of the heart never found when sought for full of affection for everybody because he was happy and because happiness renders even the wicked goodâ extended his affection even to his judge spite of villefortâ severe look and stern accent edmond_dantã_s seemed full of kindness pardieu said m_noirtier_de_villefort he is a noble fellow i hope i shall gain renã eâ favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on me i shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public and a sweet kiss in private full of this idea villefortâ face became so joyous that when he turned to edmond_dantã_s the latter who had watched the change on his physiognomy was smiling also
â sir said m_noirtier_de_villefort have you any enemies at least that you know â i have enemies replied edmond_dantã_s my position is not sufficiently elevated for that as for my disposition that is perhaps somewhat too hasty but i have striven to repress it i have had ten or twelve sailors under me and if you question them they will tell you that they love and respect me not as a father for i am too young but as an elder brother â but you may have excited jealousy you are about to become captain at nineteenâ an elevated post you are about to marry a pretty girl who loves you and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of someone â you are right you know man better than i do and what you say may possibly be the case i confess but if such person are among my acquaintances i prefer not to know it because then i should be forced to hate them â you are wrong you should always strive to see clearly around you you seem a worthy young man i will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation here is the paper do you know the writing as he spoke m_noirtier_de_villefort drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to edmond_dantã_s dantã read it a cloud passed over his brow as he said no monsieur_albert i do not know the writing and yet it is tolerably plain whoever did it writes well i am very fortunate added he looking gratefully at m_noirtier_de_villefort to be examined by such a man as you for this envious person is a real enemy
and by the rapid glance that the young manâ eye shot forth m_noirtier_de_villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mildness now said the deputy answer me frankly not as a prisoner to a judge but as one man to another who takes an interest in him what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter and m_noirtier_de_villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter edmond_dantã_s had just given back to him none at all i will tell you the real facts i swear by my honor as a sailor by my love for mercã_dã_s by the life of my fatherâ â speak monsieur_albert said m_noirtier_de_villefort then internally if renã_e could see me i hope she would be satisfied and would no longer call me a decapitator â well when we quitted naples captain leclere was attacked with a brain fever as we had no doctor on board and he was so anxious to arrive at elba that he would not touch at any other port his disorder rose to such a height that at the end of the third day feeling he was dying he called me to him my dear edmond_dantã_s said he swear to perform what i am going to tell you for it is a matter of the deepest importance â i swear captain replied i â well as after my death the command devolves on you as mate assume the command and bear up for the island of elba disembark at porto ferrajo ask for the grand marshal give him this letterâ perhaps they will give you another letter and charge you with a commission
you will accomplish what i was to have done and derive all the honor and profit from it â i will do it captain but perhaps i shall not be admitted to the grand marshalâ presence as easily as you expect â here is a ring that will obtain audience of him and remove every difficulty said the captain at these word he gave me a ring it was timeâ two hour after he was delirious the next day he died â and what did you do then â what i ought to have done and what everyone would have done in my place everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred but with a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands i sailed for the island of elba where i arrived the next day i ordered everybody to remain on board and went on shore alone as i had expected i found some difficulty in obtaining access to the grand marshal but i sent the ring i had received from the captain to him and was instantly admitted he questioned me concerning captain leclereâ death and as the latter had told me gave me a letter to carry on to a person in paris i undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do i landed here regulated the affairs of the vessel and hastened to visit my affianced bride whom i found more lovely than ever
thanks to m_maximilian_morrel all the forms were got over in a word i was as i told you at my marriage feast and i should have been married in an hour and tomorrow i intended to start for paris had i not been arrested on this charge which you as well as i now see to be unjust â ah said m_noirtier_de_villefort this seems to me the truth if you have been culpable it was imprudence and this imprudence was in obedience to the order of your captain give up this letter you have brought from elba and pass your word you will appear should you be required and go and rejoin your friend i am free then sir cried edmond_dantã_s joyfully â_yes but first give me this letter â you have it already for it was taken from me with some others which i see in that packet â stop a moment said the deputy as edmond_dantã_s took his hat and gloves to whom is it addressed â to monsieur_albert m_noirtier_de_villefort rue coq hã ron paris had a thunderbolt fallen into the room m_noirtier_de_villefort could not have been more stupefied he sank into his seat and hastily turning over the packet drew forth the fatal letter at which he glanced with an expression of terror m_noirtier_de_villefort rue coq hã ron no 13 murmured he growing still paler â_yes said edmond_dantã_s do you know him â no replied m_noirtier_de_villefort a faithful servant of the king does not know conspirators 0103m â_it is a conspiracy then asked edmond_dantã_s who after believing himself free now began to feel a tenfold alarm i have however already told you sir i was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter â_yes but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed said m_noirtier_de_villefort
â i was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it â have you shown this letter to anyone asked m_noirtier_de_villefort becoming still more pale to no one on my honor â everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the island of elba and addressed to m_noirtier_de_villefort â everybody except the person who gave it to me â and that was too much far too much murmured m_noirtier_de_villefort villefortâ brow darkened more and more his white lip and clenched teeth filled edmond_dantã_s with apprehension after reading the letter m_noirtier_de_villefort covered his face with his hand â_oh said edmond_dantã_s timidly what is the matter m_noirtier_de_villefort made no answer but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds and again perused the letter and you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter â i give you my word of honor sir said edmond_dantã_s but what is the matter you are illâ shall i ring for assistance shall i call â no said m_noirtier_de_villefort rising hastily stay where you are it is for me to give order here and not you â monsieur_albert replied edmond_dantã_s proudly â_it was only to summon assistance for you â i want none it was a temporary indisposition attend to yourself answer me edmond_dantã_s waited expecting a question but in vain m_noirtier_de_villefort fell back on his chair passed his hand over his brow moist with perspiration and for the third time read the letter â_oh if he knows the contents of this murmured he and that m_noirtier_de_villefort is the father of m_noirtier_de_villefort i am lost and he fixed his eye upon edmond_dantã_s as if he would have penetrated his thoughts â_oh it is impossible to doubt it cried he suddenly in heavenâ name cried the unhappy young man if
you doubt me question me i will answer you m_noirtier_de_villefort made a violent effort and in a tone he strove to render firm sir said he i am no longer able as i had hoped to restore you immediately to liberty before doing so i must consult the trial justice what my own feeling is you already know â_oh monsieur_albert cried edmond_dantã_s you have been rather a friend than a judge 0105 â well i must detain you some time longer but i will strive to make it as short as possible the principal charge against you is this letter and you seeâ â m_noirtier_de_villefort approached the fire cast it in and waited until it was entirely consumed you see i destroy it â_oh exclaimed edmond_dantã_s you are goodness itself â listen continued m_noirtier_de_villefort you can now have confidence in me after what i have done â_oh command and i will obey â listen this is not a command but advice i give you â speak and i will follow your advice â i shall detain you until this evening in the palais de justice should anyone else interrogate you say to him what you have said to me but do not breathe a word of this letter â i promise â_it was m_noirtier_de_villefort who seemed to entreat and the prisoner who reassured him you see continued he glancing toward the grate where fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames the letter is destroyed you and i alone know of its existence should you therefore be questioned deny all knowledge of itâ deny it boldly and you are saved â be satisfied i will deny it â_it was the only letter you had â_it was â swear it â i swear it m_noirtier_de_villefort rang a police agent entered
villefort whispered some word in his ear to which the officer replied by a motion of his head follow him said m_noirtier_de_villefort to edmond_dantã_s dantã saluted m_noirtier_de_villefort and retired hardly had the door closed when m_noirtier_de_villefort threw himself half fainting into a chair alas alas murmured he if the procureur himself had been at marseilles i should have been ruined this accursed letter would have destroyed all my hopes oh my father must your past career always interfere with my successes suddenly a light passed over his face a smile played round his set mouth and his haggard eye were fixed in thought this will do said he and from this letter which might have ruined me i will make my fortune now to the work i have in hand and after having assured himself that the prisoner was gone the deputy procureur hastened to the house_of_peers of his betrothed 0107 chapter the chã teau dâ if the commissary of police as he traversed the antechamber made a sign to two gendarmes who placed themselves one on dantã sâ right and the other on his left a door that communicated with the palais de justice was opened and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors whose appearance might have made even the boldest shudder the palais de justice communicated with the prison a sombre edifice that from its grated window look on the clock tower of the accoules after numberless windings edmond_dantã_s saw a door with an iron wicket the commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice every blow seeming to edmond_dantã_s as if struck on his heart the door opened the two gendarmes gently pushed him forward and the door closed with a loud sound behind him
the air he inhaled was no longer pure but thick and mephitic he was in prison he was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber but grated and barred and its appearance therefore did not greatly alarm him besides the word of m_noirtier_de_villefort who seemed to interest himself so much resounded still in his ears like a promise of freedom it was four oâ clock when edmond_dantã_s was placed in this chamber it was as we have said the 1st of march and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness the obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door convinced they were about to liberate him but the sound died away and edmond_dantã_s sank again into his seat at last about ten oâ clock and just as edmond_dantã_s began to despair step were heard in the corridor a key turned in the lock the bolts creaked the massy oaken door flew open and a flood of light from two torches pervaded the apartment by the torchlight edmond_dantã_s saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four gendarmes he had advanced at first but stopped at the sight of this display of force are you come to fetch me asked he â_yes replied a gendarme by the order of the deputy procureur â i believe so the conviction that they came from m_noirtier_de_villefort relieved all dantã sâ apprehensions he advanced calmly and placed himself in the centre of the escort a carriage waited at the door the coachman was on the box and a police officer sat beside him is this carriage for me said edmond_dantã_s â_it is for you replied a gendarme
dantã was about to speak but feeling himself urged forward and having neither the power nor the intention to resist he mounted the step and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes the two others took their place opposite and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones the prisoner glanced at the windowsâ they were grated he had changed his prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither through the grating however edmond_dantã_s saw they were passing through the rue caisserie and by the rue saint laurent and the rue taramis to the quay soon he saw the light of la consigne the carriage stopped the officer descended approached the guardhouse a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order edmond_dantã_s saw the reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay can all this force be summoned on my account thought he the officer opened the door which was locked and without speaking a word answered dantã sâ question for he saw between the ranks of the soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the port the two gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first then he was ordered to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example they advanced towards a boat which a custom house_of_peers officer held by a chain near the quay the soldiers looked at edmond_dantã_s with an air of stupid curiosity in an instant he was placed in the stern sheets of the boat between the gendarmes while the officer stationed himself at the bow a shove sent the boat adrift and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the pilon
at a shout from the boat the chain that closes the mouth of the port was lowered and in a second they were as edmond_dantã_s knew in the frioul and outside the inner harbor the prisonerâ first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure airâ for air is freedom but he soon sighed for he passed before la rã serve where he had that morning been so happy and now through the open window came the laughter and revelry of a ball edmond_dantã_s folded his hand raised his eye to heaven and prayed fervently 0111 the boat continued her voyage they had passed the tãªte de mort were now off the anse du pharo and about to double the battery this manå uvre was incomprehensible to edmond_dantã_s whither are you taking me asked he you will soon know â but stillâ â we are forbidden to give you any explanation edmond_dantã_s trained in discipline knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates who were forbidden to reply and so he remained silent the most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind the boat they were in could not make a long voyage there was no vessel at anchor outside the harbor he thought perhaps they were going to leave him on some distant point he was not bound nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him this seemed a good augury besides had not the deputy who had been so kind to him told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of m_noirtier_de_villefort he had nothing to apprehend had not m_noirtier_de_villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter the only proof against him he waited silently striving to pierce through the darkness
they had left the ile ratonneau where the lighthouse stood on the right and were now opposite the point des catalans it seemed to the prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach for it was there mercã_dã_s dwelt how was it that a presentiment did not warn mercã_dã_s that her lover was within three hundred yards of her one light alone was visible and edmond_dantã_s saw that it came from mercã dã sâ chamber mercã_dã_s was the only one awake in the whole settlement a loud cry could be heard by her but pride restrained him and he did not utter it what would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman he remained silent his eye fixed upon the light the boat went on but the prisoner thought only of mercã_dã_s an intervening elevation of land hid the light edmond_dantã_s turned and perceived that they had got out to sea while he had been absorbed in thought they had shipped their oars and hoisted sail the boat was now moving with the wind in spite of his repugnance to address the guards edmond_dantã_s turned to the nearest gendarme and taking his hand comrade said he i adjure you as a christian and a soldier to tell me where we are going i am captain edmond_dantã_s a loyal frenchman thought accused of treason tell me where you are conducting me and i promise you on my honor i will submit to my fate
the gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion who returned for answer a sign that said i see no great harm in telling him now and the gendarme replied you are a native of marseilles and a sailor and yet you do not know where you are going â on my honor i have no idea â have you no idea whatever â none at all â that is impossible â i swear to you it is true tell me i entreat â but my order â your order do not forbid your telling me what i must know in ten minute in half an hour or an hour you see i cannot escape even if i intended â unless you are blind or have never been outside the harbor you must know â i do not â look round you then edmond_dantã_s rose and looked forward when he saw rise within a hundred yards of him the black and frowning rock on which stands the chã teau dâ if this gloomy fortress which has for more than three hundred year furnished food for so many wild legends seemed to edmond_dantã_s like a scaffold to a malefactor the chã teau dâ if cried he what are we going there for the gendarme smiled i am not going there to be imprisoned said edmond_dantã_s â_it is only used for political prisoners i have committed no crime are there any magistrates or judges at the chã teau dâ if â there are only said the gendarme a governor a garrison turnkeys and good thick wall come come do not look so astonished or you will make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good nature edmond_dantã_s pressed the gendarmeâ hand as though he would crush it
â you think then said he that i am taken to the chã teau dâ if to be imprisoned there â_it is probable but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard â without any inquiry without any formality â all the formalities have been gone through the inquiry is already made â and so in spite of de villefortâ promises â i do not know what m_noirtier_de_villefort promised you said the gendarme but i know we are taking you to the chã teau dâ if but what are you doing help comrades help by a rapid movement which the gendarmeâ practiced eye had perceived edmond_dantã_s sprang forward to precipitate himself into the sea but four vigorous arm seized him as his foot quitted the bottom of the boat he fell back cursing with rage good said the gendarme placing his knee on his chest this is the way you keep your word as a sailor believe soft spoken gentlemen again hark ye my friend i have disobeyed my first order but i will not disobey the second and if you move i will blow your brains out and he levelled his carbine at edmond_dantã_s who felt the muzzle against his temple for a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him but he bethought him of de villefortâ promise and besides death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme seemed too terrible he remained motionless but gnashing his teeth and wringing his hand with fury at this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock
one of the sailors leaped on shore a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley and edmond_dantã_s guessed they were at the end of the voyage and that they were mooring the boat his guards taking him by the arm and coat collar forced him to rise and dragged him towards the step that lead to the gate of the fortress while the police officer carrying a musket with fixed bayonet followed behind edmond_dantã_s made no resistance he was like a man in a dream he saw soldiers drawn up on the embankment he knew vaguely that he was ascending a flight of step he was conscious that he passed through a door and that the door closed behind him but all this indistinctly as through a mist he did not even see the ocean that terrible barrier against freedom which the prisoners look upon with utter despair they halted for a minute during which he strove to collect his thoughts he looked around he was in a court surrounded by high wall he heard the measured tread of sentinels and as they passed before the light he saw the barrels of their muskets shine they waited upwards of ten minute certain edmond_dantã_s could not escape the gendarmes released him they seemed awaiting order the order came where is the prisoner said a voice here replied the gendarmes let him follow me i will take him to his cell â go said the gendarmes thrusting edmond_dantã_s forward the prisoner followed his guide who led him into a room almost under ground whose bare and reeking wall seemed as though impregnated with tears a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly and showed edmond_dantã_s the features of his conductor an under jailer ill clothed and of sullen appearance 0113
m here is your chamber for tonight said he â_it is late and the governor is asleep tomorrow perhaps he may change you in the meantime there is bread water and fresh straw and that is all a prisoner can wish for goodnight and before edmond_dantã_s could open his mouthâ before he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the waterâ before he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was the jailer disappeared taking with him the lamp and closing the door leaving stamped upon the prisonerâ mind the dim reflection of the dripping wall of his dungeon edmond_dantã_s was alone in darkness and in silenceâ cold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning forehead with the first dawn of day the jailer returned with order to leave edmond_dantã_s where he was he found the prisoner in the same position as if fixed there his eye swollen with weeping he had passed the night standing and without sleep the jailer advanced edmond_dantã_s appeared not to perceive him he touched him on the shoulder edmond_dantã_s started have you not slept said the jailer i do not know replied edmond_dantã_s the jailer stared are you hungry continued he i do not know â do you wish for anything â i wish to see the governor the jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the chamber edmond_dantã_s followed him with his eye and stretched forth his hand towards the open door but the door closed all his emotion then burst forth he cast himself on the ground weeping bitterly and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus punished the day passed thus he scarcely tasted food but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its cage
one thought in particular tormented him namely that during his journey hither he had sat so still whereas he might a dozen time have plunged into the sea and thanks to his powers of swimming for which he was famous have gained the shore concealed himself until the arrival of a genoese or spanish vessel escaped to spain or italy where mercã_dã_s and his father could have joined him he had no fears as to how he should liveâ good seamen are welcome everywhere he spoke italian like a tuscan and spanish like a castilian he would have been free and happy with mercã_dã_s and his father whereas he was now confined in the chã teau dâ if that impregnable fortress ignorant of the future destiny of his father and mercã_dã_s and all this because he had trusted to villefortâ promise the thought was maddening and edmond_dantã_s threw himself furiously down on his straw the next morning at the same hour the jailer came again well said the jailer are you more reasonable today edmond_dantã_s made no reply come cheer up is there anything that i can do for you â i wish to see the governor â i have already told you it was impossible â why so â because it is against prison rules and prisoners must not even ask for it â what is allowed then â better fare if you pay for it books and leave to walk about â i do not want books i am satisfied with my food and do not care to walk about but i wish to see the governor â if you worry me by repeating the same thing i will not bring you any more to eat â well then said edmond_dantã_s if you do not i shall die of hungerâ that is all
the jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer he replied in a more subdued tone what you ask is impossible but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about and some day you will meet the governor and if he chooses to reply that is his affair â but asked edmond_dantã_s how long shall i have to wait â ah a monthâ six monthsâ a year â_it is too long a time i wish to see him at once â ah said the jailer do not always brood over what is impossible or you will be mad in a fortnight â you think so â_yes we have an instance here it was by always offering a million of franc to the governor for his liberty that an abbã became mad who was in this chamber before you 0119 â how long has he left it â two year â was he liberated then â no he was put in a dungeon â listen said edmond_dantã_s i am not an abbã i am not mad perhaps i shall be but at present unfortunately i am not i will make you another offer â what is that â i do not offer you a million because i have it not but i will give you a hundred crowns if the first time you go to marseilles you will seek out a young girl named mercã_dã_s at the catalans and give her two lines from me 0120m if i took them and were detected i should lose my place which is worth two thousand franc a year so that i should be a great fool to run such a risk for three hundred â well
said edmond_dantã_s mark this if you refuse at least to tell mercã_dã_s i am here i will some day hide myself behind the door and when you enter i will dash out your brains with this stool â threats cried the jailer retreating and putting himself on the defensive you are certainly going mad the abbã began like you and in three day you will be like him mad enough to tie up but fortunately there are dungeons here edmond_dantã_s whirled the stool round his head all right all right said the jailer all right since you will have it so i will send word to the governor â very well returned edmond_dantã_s dropping the stool and sitting on it as if he were in reality mad the jailer went out and returned in an instant with a corporal and four soldiers by the governorâ order said he conduct the prisoner to the tier beneath â to the dungeon then said the corporal â_yes we must put the madman with the madmen the soldiers seized edmond_dantã_s who followed passively he descended fifteen step and the door of a dungeon was opened and he was thrust in the door closed and edmond_dantã_s advanced with outstretched hand until he touched the wall he then sat down in the corner until his eye became accustomed to the darkness the jailer was right edmond_dantã_s wanted but little of being utterly mad chapter the evening of the betrothal m_noirtier_de_villefort had as we have said hastened back to madame de saint mã ranâ in the place du grand cours and on entering the house_of_peers found that the guests whom he had left at table were taking coffee in the salon
renã was with all the rest of the company anxiously awaiting him and his entrance was followed by a general exclamation well decapitator guardian of the state royalist brutus what is the matter said one speak out â are we threatened with a fresh reign of terror asked another has the corsican ogre broken loose cried a third marquise said m_noirtier_de_villefort approaching his future mother in law i request your pardon for thus leaving you will the marquis honor me by a few momentsâ private conversation â ah it is really a serious matter then asked the marquis remarking the cloud on villefortâ brow so serious that i must take leave of you for a few day so added he turning to renã_e judge for yourself if it be not important â you are going to leave us cried renã_e unable to hide her emotion at this unexpected announcement alas returned m_noirtier_de_villefort i must â where then are you going asked the marquise that madame is an official secret but if you have any commissions for paris a friend of mine is going there tonight and will with pleasure undertake them the guests looked at each other you wish to speak to me alone said the marquis â_yes let us go to the library please the marquis took his arm and they left the salon well asked he as soon as they were by themselves tell me what it is â an affair of the greatest importance that demands my immediate presence in paris now excuse the indiscretion marquis but have you any landed property â all my fortune is in the funds seven or eight hundred thousand franc â then sell outâ sell out marquis or you will lose it all 0123 â but how can i sell out here â you have a broker have you not
â yes â then give me a letter to him and tell him to sell out without an instantâ delay perhaps even now i shall arrive too late â the deuce you say replied the marquis let us lose no time then and sitting down he wrote a letter to his broker ordering him to sell out at the market price now then said m_noirtier_de_villefort placing the letter in his pocketbook i must have another â to whom â to the king â to the king â_yes â i dare not write to his majesty â i do not ask you to write to his majesty but ask de salvieux to do so i want a letter that will enable me to reach the kingâ presence without all the formalities of demanding an audience that would occasion a loss of precious time â but address yourself to the keeper of the seals he has the right of entry at the tuileries and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or night â doubtless but there is no occasion to divide the honor of my discovery with him the keeper would leave me in the background and take all the glory to himself i tell you marquis my fortune is made if i only reach the tuileries the first for the king will not forget the service i do him â in that case go and get ready i will call salvieux and make him write the letter â be as quick as possible i must be on the road in a quarter of an hour â tell your coachman to stop at the door â you will present my excuses to the marquise and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars renã_e whom i leave on such a day with
great regret â you will find them both here and can make your farewells in person â a thousand thanksâ and now for the letter the marquis rang a servant entered say to the comte de salvieux that i would like to see him â now then go said the marquis i shall be gone only a few moment m_noirtier_de_villefort hastily quitted the apartment but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion he resumed his ordinary pace at his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for him it was mercã_dã_s who hearing no news of her lover had come unobserved to inquire after him as m_noirtier_de_villefort drew near she advanced and stood before him edmond_dantã_s had spoken of mercã_dã_s and m_noirtier_de_villefort instantly recognized her her beauty and high bearing surprised him and when she inquired what had become of her lover it seemed to him that she was the judge and he the accused the young man you speak of said m_noirtier_de_villefort abruptly is a great criminal and i can do nothing for him mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mercã_dã_s burst into tears and as m_noirtier_de_villefort strove to pass her again addressed him but at least tell me where he is that i may know whether he is alive or dead said she 0125 â i do not know he is no longer in my hand replied m_noirtier_de_villefort and desirous of putting an end to the interview he pushed by her and closed the door as if to exclude the pain he felt
but remorse is not thus banished like virgilâ wounded hero he carried the arrow in his wound and arrived at the salon m_noirtier_de_villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob and sank into a chair then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart the man he sacrificed to his ambition that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his fatherâ faults appeared to him pale and threatening leading his affianced bride by the hand and bringing with him remorse not such as the ancients figured furious and terrible but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death then he had a momentâ hesitation he had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded villefortâ brow because they were guilty at least he believed so but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed in this case he was not the judge but the executioner as he thus reflected he felt the sensation we have described and which had hitherto been unknown to him arise in his bosom and fill him with vague apprehensions it is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed but villefortâ was one of those that never close or if they do only close to reopen more agonizing than ever if at this moment the sweet voice of renã_e had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy or the fair mercã_dã_s had entered and said in the name of god i conjure you to restore me
my affianced husband his cold and trembling hand would have signed his release but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber and the door was opened only by villefortâ valet who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness m_noirtier_de_villefort rose or rather sprang from his chair hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket stood motionless an instant his hand pressed to his head muttered a few inarticulate sounds and then perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders he sprang into the carriage ordering the postilions to drive to de saint mã ranâ the hapless edmond_dantã_s was doomed as the marquis had promised m_noirtier_de_villefort found the marquise and renã_e in waiting he started when he saw renã_e for he fancied she was again about to plead for edmond_dantã_s alas her emotions were wholly personal she was thinking only of villefortâ departure she loved m_noirtier_de_villefort and he left her at the moment he was about to become her husband m_noirtier_de_villefort knew not when he should return and renã_e far from pleading for edmond_dantã_s hated the man whose crime separated her from her lover 0127 meanwhile what of mercã_dã_s she had met m_fernand_mondego at the corner of the rue de la loge she had returned to the catalans and had despairingly cast herself on her couch m_fernand_mondego kneeling by her side took her hand and covered it with kisses that mercã_dã_s did not even feel she passed the night thus the lamp went out for want of oil but she paid no heed to the darkness and dawn came but she knew not that it was day grief had made her blind to all but one objectâ that was edmond_dantã_s
â ah you are there said she at length turning towards m_fernand_mondego i have not quitted you since yesterday returned m_fernand_mondego sorrowfully m_maximilian_morrel had not readily given up the fight he had learned that edmond_dantã_s had been taken to prison and he had gone to all his friend and the influential person of the city but the report was already in circulation that edmond_dantã_s was arrested as a bonapartist agent and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of napoleon to remount the throne as impossible he met with nothing but refusal and had returned home in despair declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done m_caderousse was equally restless and uneasy but instead of seeking like m_maximilian_morrel to aid edmond_dantã_s he had shut himself up with two bottles of black currant brandy in the hope of drowning reflection but he did not succeed and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink and yet not so intoxicated as to forget what had happened with his elbows on the table he sat between the two empty bottles while spectres danced in the light of the unsnuffed candleâ spectres such as hoffmann strews over his punch drenched pages like black fantastic dust mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars alone was content and joyousâ he had got rid of an enemy and made his own situation on the pharaon secure mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was one of those man born with a pen behind the ear and an inkstand in place of a heart everything with him was multiplication or subtraction the life of a man was to him of far less value than a numeral especially when by taking it away he could increase the sum total of his own desires he went to bed at his usual hour and slept in peace
villefort after having received de salvieuxâ letter embraced renã_e kissed the marquiseâ hand and shaken that of the marquis started for paris along the aix road old edmond_dantã_s was dying with anxiety to know what had become of edmond_dantã_s but we know very well what had become of edmond_dantã_s chapter 10 the kingâ closet at the tuileries we will leave m_noirtier_de_villefort on the road to paris travellingâ thanks to trebled feesâ with all speed and passing through two or three apartments enter at the tuileries the little room with the arched window so well known as having been the favorite closet of napoleon and louis_xviii and now of louis_xviii philippe there seated before a walnut table he had brought with him from hartwell and to which from one of those fancies not uncommon to great people he was particularly attached the king louis_xviii was carelessly listening to a man of fifty or fifty two year of age with gray hair aristocratic bearing and exceedingly gentlemanly attire and meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of gryphiusâ rather inaccurate but much sought after edition of horaceâ a work which was much indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical monarch you say sirâ â said the king that i am exceedingly disquieted sire â really have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean kine â no sire for that would only betoken for us seven year of plenty and seven year of scarcity and with a king as full of foresight as your majesty scarcity is not a thing to be feared â then of what other scourge are you afraid my dear m_de_blacas â sire i have every reason to believe that a storm is brewing in the south â well my dear duke replied louis_xviii
i think you are wrongly informed and know positively that on the contrary it is very fine weather in that direction man of ability as he was louis_xviii liked a pleasant jest sire continued m_de_blacas if it only be to reassure a faithful servant will your majesty send into languedoc provence and dauphinã trusty man who will bring you back a faithful report as to the feeling in these three provinces â canimus surdis replied the king continuing the annotations in his horace sire replied the courtier laughing in order that he might seem to comprehend the quotation your majesty may be perfectly right in relying on the good feeling of france but i fear i am not altogether wrong in dreading some desperate attempt â by whom â by bonaparte or at least by his adherents â my dear m_de_blacas said the king you with your alarms prevent me from working â and you sire prevent me from sleeping with your security â wait my dear sir wait a moment for i have such a delightful note on the pastor quum traheret wait and i will listen to you afterwards there was a brief pause during which louis_xviii
wrote in a hand as small as possible another note on the margin of his horace and then looking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of his own while he is only commenting upon the idea of another said go on my dear duke go onâ i listen â sire said m_de_blacas who had for a moment the hope of sacrificing m_noirtier_de_villefort to his own profit i am compelled to tell you that these are not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me but a serious minded man deserving all my confidence and charged by me to watch over the southâ the duke hesitated as he pronounced these word has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens the king and so i hastened to you sire â mala ducis avi domum continued louis_xviii still annotating does your majesty wish me to drop the subject â by no means my dear duke but just stretch out your hand â which â whichever you pleaseâ there to the left â here sire â i tell you to the left and you are looking to the right i mean on my leftâ yes there you will find yesterdayâ report of the minister of police but here is dandrã himself and dandrã announced by the chamberlain in waiting entered come in said louis_xviii with repressed smile come in baron and tell the duke all you knowâ the latest news of de bonaparte do not conceal anything however serious let us see the island of elba is a volcano and we may expect to have issuing thence flaming and bristling warâ bella horrida bella
m dandrã leaned very respectfully on the back of a chair with his two hand and said has your majesty perused yesterdayâ report â_yes yes but tell the duke himself who cannot find anything what the report containsâ give him the particulars of what the usurper is doing in his islet â monsieur_albert said the baron to the duke all the servant of his majesty must approve of the latest intelligence which we have from the island of elba bonaparteâ â dandrã looked at louis_xviii who employed in writing a note did not even raise his head bonaparte continued the baron is mortally wearied and passes whole day in watching his miners at work at porto longone â and scratches himself for amusement added the king scratches himself inquired the duke what does your majesty mean â_yes indeed my dear duke did you forget that this great man this hero this demigod is attacked with a malady of the skin which worries him to death prurigo â and moreover my dear duke continued the minister of police we are almost assured that in a very short time the usurper will be insane â insane â raving mad his head becomes weaker sometimes he weeps bitterly sometimes laughs boisterously at other time he passes hour on the seashore flinging stones in the water and when the flint makes duck and drakeâ five or six time he appears as delighted as if he had gained another marengo or austerlitz now you must agree that these are indubitable symptoms of insanity â or of wisdom my dear baronâ or of wisdom said louis_xviii laughing the greatest captains of antiquity amused themselves by casting pebbles into the oceanâ see plutarchâ life of scipio africanus m_de_blacas pondered deeply between the confident monarch and the truthful minister
villefort who did not choose to reveal the whole secret lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure had yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness well well dandrã said louis_xviii m_de_blacas is not yet convinced let us proceed therefore to the usurperâ conversion the minister of police bowed the usurperâ conversion murmured the duke looking at the king and dandrã who spoke alternately like virgilâ shepherds the usurper converted â decidedly my dear duke â in what way converted â to good principles tell him all about it baron â why this is the way of it said the minister with the gravest air in the world napoleon lately had a review and as two or three of his old veterans expressed a desire to return to france he gave them their dismissal and exhorted them to serve the good king these were his own word of that i am certain â well m_de_blacas what think you of this inquired the king triumphantly and pausing for a moment from the voluminous scholiast before him i say sire that the minister of police is greatly deceived or i am and as it is impossible it can be the minister of police as he has the guardianship of the safety and honor of your majesty it is probable that i am in error however sire if i might advise your majesty will interrogate the person of whom i spoke to you and i will urge your majesty to do him this honor â most willingly duke under your auspices i will receive any person you please but you must not expect me to be too confiding
baron have you any report more recent than this dated the 20th february and this is the 3rd of march â no sire but i am hourly expecting one it may have arrived since i left my office â go thither and if there be noneâ well well continued louis_xviii make one that is the usual way is it not and the king laughed facetiously â_oh sire replied the minister we have no occasion to invent any every day our desks are loaded with most circumstantial denunciations coming from hosts of people who hope for some return for services which they seek to render but cannot they trust to fortune and rely upon some unexpected event in some way to justify their predictions â well sir goâ said louis_xviii and remember that i am waiting for you â i will but go and return sire i shall be back in ten minute â and i sire said m_de_blacas will go and find my messenger â wait sir wait said louis_xviii really m_de_blacas i must change your armorial bearings i will give you an eagle with outstretched wings holding in its claws a prey which tries in vain to escape and bearing this deviceâ tenax 0133m sire i listen said m_de_blacas biting his nails with impatience i wish to consult you on this passage molli fugiens anhelitu you know it refers to a stag flying from a wolf are you not a sportsman and a great wolf hunter well then what do you think of the molli anhelitu â admirable
sire but my messenger is like the stag you refer to for he has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three day â which is undergoing great fatigue and anxiety my dear duke when we have a telegraph which transmits messages in three or four hour and that without getting in the least out of breath â ah sire you recompense but badly this poor young man who has come so far and with so much ardor to give your majesty useful information if only for the sake of de salvieux who recommends him to me i entreat your majesty to receive him graciously â de salvieux my brotherâ chamberlain â_yes sire â he is at marseilles â and writes me thence â does he speak to you of this conspiracy â no but strongly recommends m_noirtier_de_villefort and begs me to present him to your majesty â m_noirtier_de_villefort cried the king is the messengerâ name m_noirtier_de_villefort â_yes sire â and he comes from marseilles â in person â why did you not mention his name at once replied the king betraying some uneasiness sire i thought his name was unknown to your majesty â no no m_de_blacas he is a man of strong and elevated understanding ambitious too and pardieu you know his fatherâ name â his father â_yes m_noirtier_de_villefort â m_noirtier_de_villefort the girondin m_noirtier_de_villefort the senator â he himself â and your majesty has employed the son of such a man â m_de_blacas my friend you have but limited comprehension i told you m_noirtier_de_villefort was ambitious and to attain this ambition m_noirtier_de_villefort would sacrifice everything even his father â then sire may i present him â this instant duke where is he â waiting below in my carriage â seek him at once â i hasten to do so
the duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man his really sincere royalism made him youthful again louis_xviii remained alone and turning his eye on his half opened horace muttered justum et tenacem propositi virum m_de_blacas returned as speedily as he had departed but in the antechamber he was forced to appeal to the kingâ authority villefortâ dusty garb his costume which was not of courtly cut excited the susceptibility of de brezã who was all astonishment at finding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king in such attire the duke however overcame all difficulties with a wordâ his majestyâ order and in spite of the protestations which the master of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles m_noirtier_de_villefort was introduced the king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him on opening the door m_noirtier_de_villefort found himself facing him and the young magistrateâ first impulse was to pause come in m_noirtier_de_villefort said the king come in m_noirtier_de_villefort bowed and advancing a few step waited until the king should interrogate him m_noirtier_de_villefort said louis_xviii
the duc m_de_blacas assures me you have some interesting information to communicate â sire the duke is right and i believe your majesty will think it equally important 0137m in the first place and before everything else sir is the news as bad in your opinion as i am asked to believe â sire i believe it to be most urgent but i hope by the speed i have used that it is not irreparable â speak as fully as you please sir said the king who began to give way to the emotion which had showed itself in blacasâ face and affected villefortâ voice speak sir and pray begin at the beginning i like order in everything â sire said m_noirtier_de_villefort i will render a faithful report to your majesty but i must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language a glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium assured m_noirtier_de_villefort of the benignity of his august auditor and he went on sire i have come as rapidly to paris as possible to inform your majesty that i have discovered in the exercise of my duties not a commonplace and insignificant plot such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army but an actual conspiracyâ a storm which menaces no less than your majestyâ throne sire the usurper is arming three ships he meditates some project which however mad is yet perhaps terrible at this moment he will have left elba to go whither i know not but assuredly to attempt a landing either at naples or on the coast of tuscany or perhaps on the shores of france
your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the island of elba has maintained his relations with italy and france â i am sir said the king much agitated and recently we have had information that the bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the rue saint jacques but proceed i beg of you how did you obtain these details â sire they are the results of an examination which i have made of a man of marseilles whom i have watched for some time and arrested on the day of my departure this person a sailor of turbulent character and whom i suspected of bonapartism has been secretly to the island of elba there he saw the grand marshal who charged him with an oral message to a bonapartist in paris whose name i could not extract from him but this mission was to prepare menâ mind for a return it is the man who says this sire a return which will soon occur â and where is this man â in prison sire â and the matter seems serious to you â so serious sire that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst of a family festival on the very day of my betrothal i left my bride and friend postponing everything that i might hasten to lay at your majestyâ foot the fears which impressed me and the assurance of my devotion â true said louis_xviii was there not a marriage engagement between you and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars de madame_de_saint_mã_ran â daughter of one of your majestyâ most faithful servant â_yes yes but let us talk of this plot m_noirtier_de_villefort â sire i fear it is more than a plot i fear it is a conspiracy â a conspiracy in these time said louis_xviii
smiling is a thing very easy to meditate but more difficult to conduct to an end inasmuch as re established so recently on the throne of our ancestors we have our eye open at once upon the past the present and the future for the last ten month my ministers have redoubled their vigilance in order to watch the shore of the mediterranean if bonaparte landed at naples the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach piombino if he land in tuscany he will be in an unfriendly territory if he land in france it must be with a handful of man and the result of that is easily foretold execrated as he is by the population take courage sir but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude â ah here is dandrã cried m_de_blacas at this instant the minister of police appeared at the door pale trembling and as if ready to faint m_noirtier_de_villefort was about to retire but m_de_blacas taking his hand restrained him chapter 11 the corsican ogre at the sight of this agitation louis_xviii pushed from him violently the table at which he was sitting what ails you baron he exclaimed you appear quite aghast has your uneasiness anything to do with what m_de_blacas has told me and m_noirtier_de_villefort has just confirmed m_de_blacas moved suddenly towards the baron but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the statesman and besides as matters were it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect sire â stammered the baron well what is it asked louis_xviii
the minister of police giving way to an impulse of despair was about to throw himself at the foot of louis_xviii who retreated a step and frowned will you speak he said â_oh sire what a dreadful misfortune i am indeed to be pitied i can never forgive myself â monsieur_albert said louis_xviii i command you to speak â well sire the usurper left elba on the 26th february and landed on the 1st of march â and where in italy asked the king eagerly in france sire at a small port near antibes in the gulf of juan â the usurper landed in france near antibes in the gulf of juan two hundred and fifty leagues from paris on the 1st of march and you only acquired this information today the 3rd of march well sir what you tell me is impossible you must have received a false report or you have gone mad â alas sire it is but too true louis_xviii made a gesture of indescribable anger and alarm and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had struck him at the same moment in heart and countenance in france he cried the usurper in france then they did not watch over this man who knows they were perhaps in league with him â_oh sire exclaimed the duc m_de_blacas m dandrã is not a man to be accused of treason sire we have all been blind and the minister of police has shared the general blindness that is all â butâ â said m_noirtier_de_villefort and then suddenly checking himself he was silent then he continued your pardon sire he said bowing my zeal carried me away will your majesty deign to excuse me â speak sir speak boldly replied louis_xviii
â you alone forewarned us of the evil now try and aid us with the remedy â sire said m_noirtier_de_villefort the usurper is detested in the south and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south it would be easy to raise languedoc and provence against him â_yes assuredly replied the minister but he is advancing by gap and sisteron â advancingâ he is advancing said louis_xviii is he then advancing on paris the minister of police maintained a silence which was equivalent to a complete avowal and dauphinã sir inquired the king of m_noirtier_de_villefort do you think it possible to rouse that as well as provence â sire i am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact but the feeling in dauphinã is quite the reverse of that in provence or languedoc the mountaineers are bonapartists sire â then murmured louis_xviii he was well informed and how many man had he with him â i do not know sire answered the minister of police what you do not know have you neglected to obtain information on that point of course it is of no consequence he added with a withering smile sire it was impossible to learn the despatch simply stated the fact of the landing and the route taken by the usurper â and how did this despatch reach you inquired the king the minister bowed his head and while a deep color overspread his cheeks he stammered out by the telegraph sire louis_xviii advanced a step and folded his arm over his chest as napoleon would have done 0141 â so then he exclaimed turning pale with anger seven conjoined and allied armies overthrew that man a miracle of heaven replaced me on the throne of my father after five and twenty year of exile
i have during those five and twenty year spared no pains to understand the people of france and the interests which were confided to me and now when i see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach the power i hold in my hand bursts and shatters me to atoms â sire it is fatality murmured the minister feeling that the pressure of circumstances however light a thing to destiny was too much for any human strength to endure what our enemies say of us is then true we have learnt nothing forgotten nothing if i were betrayed as he was i would console myself but to be in the midst of person elevated by myself to place of honor who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves for my fortune is theirsâ before me they were nothingâ after me they will be nothing and perish miserably from incapacityâ ineptitude oh yes sir you are rightâ it is fatality the minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm m_de_blacas wiped the moisture from his brow m_noirtier_de_villefort smiled within himself for he felt his increased importance to fall continued king louis_xviii who at the first glance had sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended â to fall and learn of that fall by telegraph oh i would rather mount the scaffold of my brother louis_xviii xvi than thus descend the staircase at the tuileries driven away by ridicule ridicule sirâ why you know not its power in france and yet you ought to know it â sire sire murmured the minister for pityâ sâ â approach m_noirtier_de_villefort resumed the king addressing the young man who motionless and breathless was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a kingdom
â approach and tell monsieur_albert that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known â sire it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the world â really impossible yesâ that is a great word sir unfortunately there are great word as there are great man i have measured them really impossible for a minister who has an office agents spies and fifteen hundred thousand franc for secret service money to know what is going on at sixty leagues from the coast of france well then see here is a gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposalâ a gentleman only a simple magistrate who learned more than you with all your police and who would have saved my crown if like you he had the power of directing a telegraph the look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on m_noirtier_de_villefort who bent his head in modest triumph i do not mean that for you m_de_blacas continued louis_xviii for if you have discovered nothing at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your suspicions any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of m_noirtier_de_villefort insignificant or else dictated by venal ambition these word were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before m_noirtier_de_villefort understood the kingâ intent any other person would perhaps have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister although he saw that dandrã was irrevocably lost
in fact the minister who in the plenitude of his power had been unable to unearth napoleonâ secret might in despair at his own downfall interrogate edmond_dantã_s and so lay bare the motives of villefortâ plot realizing this m_noirtier_de_villefort came to the rescue of the crest fallen minister instead of aiding to crush him sire said m_noirtier_de_villefort the suddenness of this event must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the hand of providence what your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing to chance and i have profited by that chance like a good and devoted servantâ thatâ all do not attribute to me more than i deserve sire that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me the minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look and m_noirtier_de_villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design that is to say that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king he had made a friend of one on whom in case of necessity he might rely â tis well resumed the king and now gentlemen he continued turning towards m_de_blacas and the minister of police i have no further occasion for you and you may retire what now remains to do is in the department of the minister of war â fortunately sire said m_de_blacas we can rely on the army your majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment â do not mention reports duke to me for i know now what confidence to place in them
yet speaking of reports baron what have you learned with regard to the affair in the rue saint jacques â the affair in the rue saint jacques exclaimed m_noirtier_de_villefort unable to repress an exclamation then suddenly pausing he added your pardon sire but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget not the respect i have for that is too deeply engraved in my heart but the rules of etiquette â go on go on sir replied the king you have today earned the right to make inquiries here â sire interposed the minister of police i came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which i had obtained on this head when your majestyâ attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty â on the contrary sir on the contrary said louis_xviii this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention and the death of general m_franz_de_quesnel will perhaps put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy at the name of general m_franz_de_quesnel m_noirtier_de_villefort trembled everything points to the conclusion sire said the minister of police that death was not the result of suicide as we first believed but of assassination general m_franz_de_quesnel it appears had just left a bonapartist club when he disappeared an unknown person had been with him that morning and made an appointment with him in the rue saint jacques unfortunately the generalâ valet who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered heard the street mentioned but did not catch the number
as the police minister related this to the king m_noirtier_de_villefort who looked as if his very life hung on the speakerâ lip turned alternately red and pale the king looked towards him do you not think with me m_noirtier_de_villefort that general m_franz_de_quesnel whom they believed attached to the usurper but who was really entirely devoted to me has perished the victim of a bonapartist ambush â_it is probable sire replied m_noirtier_de_villefort but is this all that is known â they are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him â on his track said m_noirtier_de_villefort â_yes the servant has given his description he is a man of from fifty to fifty two year of age dark with black eye covered with shaggy eyebrows and a thick moustache he was dressed in a blue frock coat buttoned up to the chin and wore at his button hole the rosette of an officer of the legion of honor yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed but he was lost sight of at the corner of the rue de la jussienne and the rue coq hã ron m_noirtier_de_villefort leaned on the back of an armchair for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him he breathed again continue to seek for this man sir said the king to the minister of police for if as i am all but convinced general m_franz_de_quesnel who would have been so useful to us at this moment has been murdered his assassins bonapartists or not shall be cruelly punished â_it required all villefortâ coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him
â how strange continued the king with some asperity the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say a murder has been committed and especially so when they can add and we are on the track of the guilty person â sire your majesty will i trust be amply satisfied on this point at least â we shall see i will no longer detain you m_noirtier_de_villefort for you must be fatigued after so long a journey go and rest of course you stopped at your fatherâ â a feeling of faintness came over m_noirtier_de_villefort 0145m no sire he replied i alighted at the hotel de madrid in the rue de tournon â but you have seen him â sire i went straight to the duc m_de_blacas â but you will see him then â i think not sire â ah i forgot said louis_xviii smiling in a manner which proved that all these questions were not made without a motive i forgot you and m_noirtier_de_villefort are not on the best terms possible and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause and for which you should be recompensed â sire the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that i have nothing more to ask for â never mind sir we will not forget you make your mind easy in the meanwhileâ the king here detached the cross of the legion of honor which he usually wore over his blue coat near the cross of st louis_xviii above the order of notre dame du mont carmel and st lazare and gave it to m_noirtier_de_villefort â in the meanwhile take this cross â sire said m_noirtier_de_villefort your majesty mistakes this is an officerâ cross â ma foi said louis_xviii
take it such as it is for i have not the time to procure you another m_de_blacas let it be your care to see that the brevet is made out and sent to m_noirtier_de_villefort villefortâ eye were filled with tears of joy and pride he took the cross and kissed it and now he said may i inquire what are the order with which your majesty deigns to honor me â take what rest you require and remember that if you are not able to serve me here in paris you may be of the greatest service to me at marseilles â sire replied m_noirtier_de_villefort bowing in an hour i shall have quitted paris â go sir said the king and should i forget you kingsâ memories are short do not be afraid to bring yourself to my recollection baron send for the minister of war m_de_blacas remain â ah sir said the minister of police to m_noirtier_de_villefort as they left the tuileries you entered by luckâ doorâ your fortune is made â will it be long first muttered m_noirtier_de_villefort saluting the minister whose career was ended and looking about him for a hackney coach one passed at the moment which he hailed he gave his address to the driver and springing in threw himself on the seat and gave loose to dreams of ambition ten minute afterwards m_noirtier_de_villefort reached his hotel ordered horse to be ready in two hour and asked to have his breakfast brought to him he was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and loud the valet opened the door and m_noirtier_de_villefort heard someone speak his name 0147 â who could know that i was here already said the young man the valet entered
â well said m_noirtier_de_villefort what is it who rang who asked for me â a stranger who will not send in his name â a stranger who will not send in his name what can he want with me â he wishes to speak to you â to me â_yes â did he mention my name â_yes â what sort of person is he â why sir a man of about fifty â short or tall â about your own height sir â dark or fair â dark very dark with black eye black hair black eyebrows â and how dressed asked m_noirtier_de_villefort quickly in a blue frock coat buttoned up close decorated with the legion of honor â_it is he said m_noirtier_de_villefort turning pale 0148m eh pardieu said the individual whose description we have twice given entering the door what a great deal of ceremony is it the custom in marseilles for son to keep their father waiting in their anterooms â father cried m_noirtier_de_villefort then i was not deceived i felt sure it must be you â well then if you felt so sure replied the new comer putting his cane in a corner and his hat on a chair allow me to say my dear gã rard that it was not very filial of you to keep me waiting at the door â leave us germain said m_noirtier_de_villefort the servant quitted the apartment with evident signs of astonishment chapter 12 father and son noirtierâ for it was indeed he who enteredâ looked after the servant until the door was closed and then fearing no doubt that he might be overheard in the antechamber he opened the door again nor was the precaution useless as appeared from the rapid retreat of germain who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first parents
m m_noirtier_de_villefort then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door then that of the bedchamber and then extended his hand to m_noirtier_de_villefort who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not conceal well now my dear gã rard said he to the young man with a very significant look do you know you seem as if you were not very glad to see me â my dear father said m_noirtier_de_villefort i am on the contrary delighted but i so little expected your visit that it has somewhat overcome me â but my dear fellow replied m_noirtier_de_villefort seating himself i might say the same thing to you when you announce to me your wedding for the 28th of february and on the 3rd of march you turn up here in paris â and if i have come my dear father said gã rard drawing closer to m_noirtier_de_villefort do not complain for it is for you that i came and my journey will be your salvation â ah indeed said m_noirtier_de_villefort stretching himself out at his ease in the chair really pray tell me all about it for it must be interesting â father you have heard speak of a certain bonapartist club in the rue saint jacques â no 53 yes i am vice president â father your coolness makes me shudder â why my dear boy when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers has escaped from paris in a hay cart been hunted over the plains of bordeaux by robespierreâ bloodhounds he becomes accustomed to most thing
but go on what about the club in the rue saint jacques â why they induced general m_franz_de_quesnel to go there and general m_franz_de_quesnel who quitted his own house_of_peers at nine oâ clock in the evening was found the next day in the seine 0151m and who told you this fine story â the king himself â well then in return for your story continued m_noirtier_de_villefort i will tell you another â my dear father i think i already know what you are about to tell me â ah you have heard of the landing of the emperor â not so loud father i entreat of youâ for your own sake as well as mine yes i heard this news and knew it even before you could for three day ago i posted from marseilles to paris with all possible speed half desperate at the enforced delay â three day ago you are crazy why three day ago the emperor had not landed â no matter i was aware of his intention â how did you know about it â by a letter addressed to you from the island of elba â to me â to you and which i discovered in the pocket book of the messenger had that letter fallen into the hand of another you my dear father would probably ere this have been shot villefortâ father laughed come come said he will the restoration adopt imperial methods so promptly shot my dear boy what an idea where is the letter you speak of i know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing to pass you â i burnt it for fear that even a fragment should remain for that letter must have led to your condemnation â and the destruction of your future prospects replied m_noirtier_de_villefort â_yes i can easily comprehend that
but i have nothing to fear while i have you to protect me â i do better than that sirâ i save you â you do why really the thing becomes more and more dramaticâ explain yourself â i must refer again to the club in the rue saint jacques â_it appears that this club is rather a bore to the police why didnâ they search more vigilantly they would have foundâ â they have not found but they are on the track â_yes that the usual phrase i am quite familiar with it when the police is at fault it declares that it is on the track and the government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say with a sneaking air that the track is lost â_yes but they have found a corpse the general has been killed and in all countries they call that a murder â a murder do you call it why there is nothing to prove that the general was murdered people are found every day in the seine having thrown themselves in or having been drowned from not knowing how to swim â father you know very well that the general was not a man to drown himself in despair and people do not bathe in the seine in the month of january no no do not be deceived this was murder in every sense of the word â and who thus designated it â the king himself â the king i thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in politics in politics my dear fellow you know as well as i do there are no man but ideasâ no feelings but interests in politics we do not kill a man we only remove an obstacle that is all would you like to know how matters have progressed
well i will tell you it was thought reliance might be placed in general m_franz_de_quesnel he was recommended to us from the island of elba one of us went to him and invited him to the rue saint jacques where he would find some friend he came there and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving elba the projected landing etc when he had heard and comprehended all to the fullest extent he replied that he was a royalist then all looked at each other he was made to take an oath and did so but with such an ill grace that it was really tempting providence to swear thus and yet in spite of that the general was allowed to depart freeâ perfectly free yet he did not return home what could that mean why my dear fellow that on leaving us he lost his way thatâ all a murder really m_noirtier_de_villefort you surprise me you a deputy procureur to found an accusation on such bad premises did i ever say to you when you were fulfilling your character as a royalist and cut off the head of one of my party my son you have committed a murder no i said very well sir you have gained the victory tomorrow perchance it will be our turn â but father take care when our turn comes our revenge will be sweeping â i do not understand you â you rely on the usurperâ return â we do â you are mistaken he will not advance two leagues into the interior of france without being followed tracked and caught like a wild beast â my
dear fellow the emperor is at this moment on the way to grenoble on the 10th or 12th he will be at lyons and on the 20th or 25th at paris â the people will rise â_yes to go and meet him â he has but a handful of man with him and armies will be despatched against him â_yes to escort him into the capital really my dear gã rard you are but a child you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has told you three day after the landing the usurper has landed at cannes with several man he is pursued but where is he what is he doing you do not know at all and in this way they will chase him to paris without drawing a trigger â grenoble and lyons are faithful cities and will oppose to him an impassable barrier â grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasmâ all lyons will hasten to welcome him believe me we are as well informed as you and our police are as good as your own would you like a proof of it well you wished to conceal your journey from me and yet i knew of your arrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier you gave your direction to no one but your postilion yet i have your address and in proof i am here the very instant you are going to sit at table ring then if you please for a second knife fork and plate and we will dine together â indeed replied m_noirtier_de_villefort looking at his father with astonishment you really do seem very well informed â eh the thing is simple enough
you who are in power have only the means that money producesâ we who are in expectation have those which devotion prompts â devotion said m_noirtier_de_villefort with a sneer â_yes devotion for that is i believe the phrase for hopeful ambition and villefortâ father extended his hand to the bell rope to summon the servant whom his son had not called m_noirtier_de_villefort caught his arm wait my dear father said the young man one word more â say on â however stupid the royalist police may be they do know one terrible thing â what is that â the description of the man who on the morning of the day when general m_franz_de_quesnel disappeared presented himself at his house_of_peers â_oh the admirable police have found that out have they and what may be that description â dark complexion hair eyebrows and whiskers black blue frock coat buttoned up to the chin rosette of an officer of the legion of honor in his button hole a hat with wide brim and a cane â ah ha thatâ it is it said m_noirtier_de_villefort and why then have they not laid hand on him â because yesterday or the day before they lost sight of him at the corner of the rue coq hã ron â didnâ i say that your police were good for nothing â_yes but they may catch him yet â true said m_noirtier_de_villefort looking carelessly around him true if this person were not on his guard as he is and he added with a smile he will consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance at these word he rose and put off his frock coat and cravat went towards a table on which lay his sonâ toilet articles lathered his face took a razor and with a firm hand cut off the compromising whiskers m_noirtier_de_villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration
his whiskers cut off m_noirtier_de_villefort gave another turn to his hair took instead of his black cravat a colored neckerchief which lay at the top of an open portmanteau put on in lieu of his blue and high buttoned frock coat a coat of villefortâ of dark brown and cut away in front tried on before the glass a narrow brimmed hat of his sonâ which appeared to fit him perfectly and leaving his cane in the corner where he had deposited it he took up a small bamboo switch cut the air with it once or twice and walked about with that easy swagger which was one of his principal characteristics well he said turning towards his wondering son when this disguise was completed well do you think your police will recognize me now â no father stammered m_noirtier_de_villefort at least i hope not â and now my dear boy continued m_noirtier_de_villefort i rely on your prudence to remove all the thing which i leave in your care â_oh rely on me said m_noirtier_de_villefort â_yes yes and now i believe you are right and that you have really saved my life be assured i will return the favor hereafter m_noirtier_de_villefort shook his head you are not convinced yet â i hope at least that you may be mistaken â shall you see the king again â perhaps â would you pass in his eye for a prophet â prophets of evil are not in favor at the court father â true but some day they do them justice and supposing a second restoration you would then pass for a great man â well what should i say to the king â say this to him
â sire you are deceived as to the feeling in france as to the opinions of the towns and the prejudices of the army he whom in paris you call the corsican ogre who at nevers is styled the usurper is already saluted as bonaparte at lyons and emperor at grenoble you think he is tracked pursued captured he is advancing as rapidly as his own eagles the soldiers you believe to be dying with hunger worn out with fatigue ready to desert gather like atoms of snow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward sire go leave france to its real master to him who acquired it not by purchase but by right of conquest go sire not that you incur any risk for your adversary is powerful enough to show you mercy but because it would be humiliating for a grandson of saint louis_xviii to owe his life to the man of arcola marengo austerlitz tell him this gã rard or rather tell him nothing keep your journey a secret do not boast of what you have come to paris to do or have done return with all speed enter marseilles at night and your house_of_peers by the back door and there remain quiet submissive secret and above all inoffensive for this time i swear to you we shall act like powerful man who know their enemies go my sonâ go my dear gã rard and by your obedience to my paternal order or if you prefer it friendly counsels we will keep you in your place this will be added m_noirtier_de_villefort with a smile one means by which you may a second time save me if the political balance should some day take another turn and cast you aloft while hurling me down
adieu my dear gã rard and at your next journey alight at my door m_noirtier_de_villefort left the room when he had finished with the same calmness that had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation m_noirtier_de_villefort pale and agitated ran to the window put aside the curtain and saw him pass cool and collected by two or three ill looking man at the corner of the street who were there perhaps to arrest a man with black whiskers and a blue frock coat and hat with broad brim m_noirtier_de_villefort stood watching breathless until his father had disappeared at the rue bussy then he turned to the various articles he had left behind him put the black cravat and blue frock coat at the bottom of the portmanteau threw the hat into a dark closet broke the cane into small bits and flung it in the fire put on his travelling cap and calling his valet checked with a look the thousand questions he was ready to ask paid his bill sprang into his carriage which was ready learned at lyons that bonaparte had entered grenoble and in the midst of the tumult which prevailed along the road at length reached marseilles a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the heart of man with ambition and its first successes chapter 13 the hundred day m_noirtier_de_villefort was a true prophet and thing progressed rapidly as he had predicted everyone knows the history of the famous return from elba a return which was unprecedented in the past and will probably remain without a counterpart in the future louis_xviii
made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new idea fell to the ground m_noirtier_de_villefort therefore gained nothing save the kingâ gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the legion of honor which he had the prudence not to wear although m_de_blacas had duly forwarded the brevet napoleon would doubtless have deprived m_noirtier_de_villefort of his office had it not been for m_noirtier_de_villefort who was all powerful at court and thus the girondin of 93 and the senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had been his protector all villefortâ influence barely enabled him to stifle the secret edmond_dantã_s had so nearly divulged the kingâ procureur alone was deprived of his office being suspected of royalism however scarcely was the imperial power establishedâ that is scarcely had the emperor re entered the tuileries and begun to issue order from the closet into which we have introduced our readers he found on the table there louis_xviii s half filled snuff box scarcely had this occurred when marseilles began in spite of the authorities to rekindle the flames of civil war always smouldering in the south and it required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater violence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the royalists whenever they ventured abroad 0159 owing to this change the worthy shipowner became at that
momentâ we will not say all powerful because m_maximilian_morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man so much so that many of the most zealous partisans of bonaparte accused him of moderationâ but sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of edmond_dantã_s m_noirtier_de_villefort retained his place but his marriage was put off until a more favorable opportunity if the emperor remained on the throne gã rard required a different alliance to aid his career if louis_xviii returned the influence of de madame_de_saint_mã_ran like his own could be vastly increased and the marriage be still more suitable the deputy procureur was therefore the first magistrate of marseilles when one morning his door opened and m_maximilian_morrel was announced anyone else would have hastened to receive him but m_noirtier_de_villefort was a man of ability and he knew this would be a sign of weakness he made m_maximilian_morrel wait in the antechamber although he had no one with him for the simple reason that the kingâ procureur always makes everyone wait and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the paper he ordered m_maximilian_morrel to be admitted m_maximilian_morrel expected m_noirtier_de_villefort would be dejected he found him as he had found him six weeks before calm firm and full of that glacial politeness that most insurmountable barrier which separates the well bred from the vulgar man he had entered villefortâ office expecting that the magistrate would tremble at the sight of him on the contrary he felt a cold shudder all over him when he saw m_noirtier_de_villefort sitting there with his elbow on his desk and his head leaning on his hand
he stopped at the door m_noirtier_de_villefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him then after a brief interval during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his hand m_maximilian_morrel i believe said m_noirtier_de_villefort â_yes sir â come nearer said the magistrate with a patronizing wave of the hand and tell me to what circumstance i owe the honor of this visit â do you not guess monsieur_albert asked m_maximilian_morrel not in the least but if i can serve you in any way i shall be delighted â everything depends on you â explain yourself pray â monsieur_albert said m_maximilian_morrel recovering his assurance as he proceeded do you recollect that a few day before the landing of his majesty the emperor i came to intercede for a young man the mate of my ship who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the island of elba what was the other day a crime is today a title to favor you then served louis_xviii and you did not show any favorâ it was your duty today you serve napoleon and you ought to protect himâ it is equally your duty i come therefore to ask what has become of him 0161m m_noirtier_de_villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself what is his name said he tell me his name â edmond_dantã_s m_noirtier_de_villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a pistol at five and twenty paces than have heard this name spoken but he did not blanch edmond_dantã_s repeated he edmond_dantã_s â_yes monsieur_albert m_noirtier_de_villefort opened a large register then went to a table from the table turned to his registers and then turning to m_maximilian_morrel are you quite sure you are not mistaken monsieur_albert said he in the most natural tone in the world
had m_maximilian_morrel been a more quick sighted man or better versed in these matters he would have been surprised at the kingâ procureur answering him on such a subject instead of referring him to the governors of the prison or the prefect of the department but m_maximilian_morrel disappointed in his expectations of exciting fear was conscious only of the otherâ condescension m_noirtier_de_villefort had calculated rightly no said m_maximilian_morrel i am not mistaken i have known him for ten year the last four of which he was in my service do not you recollect i came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency as i come today to plead for justice you received me very coldly oh the royalists were very severe with the bonapartists in those day â monsieur_albert returned m_noirtier_de_villefort i was then a royalist because i believed the bourbons not only the heirs to the throne but the chosen of the nation the miraculous return of napoleon has conquered me the legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people â thatâ right cried m_maximilian_morrel i like to hear you speak thus and i augur well for edmond_dantã_s from it â wait a moment said m_noirtier_de_villefort turning over the leaves of a register i have itâ a sailor who was about to marry a young catalan girl i recollect now it was a very serious charge â how so â you know that when he left here he was taken to the palais de justice â well â i made my report to the authorities at paris and a week after he was carried off â carried off said m_maximilian_morrel what can they have done with him â_oh he has been taken to fenestrelles to pignerol or to the sainte marguã rite islands
some fine morning he will return to take command of your vessel â come when he will it shall be kept for him but how is it he is not already returned it seems to me the first care of government should be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it â do not be too hasty m_maximilian_morrel replied m_noirtier_de_villefort the order of imprisonment came from high authority and the order for his liberation must proceed from the same source and as napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight the letter have not yet been forwarded â but said m_maximilian_morrel is there no way of expediting all these formalitiesâ of releasing him from arrest â there has been no arrest â how â_it is sometimes essential to government to cause a manâ disappearance without leaving any traces so that no written forms or documents may defeat their wishes â_it might be so under the bourbons but at presentâ â â_it has always been so my dear m_maximilian_morrel since the reign of louis_xviii xiv the emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even louis_xviii himself and the number of prisoners whose name are not on the register is incalculable had m_maximilian_morrel even any suspicions so much kindness would have dispelled them well m_noirtier_de_villefort how would you advise me to act asked he petition the minister â_oh i know what that is the minister receives two hundred petitions every day and does not read three â that is true but he will read a petition countersigned and presented by me â and will you undertake to deliver it â with the greatest pleasure
dantã was then guilty and now he is innocent and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn him m_noirtier_de_villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry which however improbable it might be if it did take place would leave him defenceless but how shall i address the minister â sit down there said m_noirtier_de_villefort giving up his place to m_maximilian_morrel and write what i dictate â will you be so good â certainly but lose no time we have lost too much already â that is true only think what the poor fellow may even now be suffering m_noirtier_de_villefort shuddered at the suggestion but he had gone too far to draw back edmond_dantã_s must be crushed to gratify villefortâ ambition m_noirtier_de_villefort dictated a petition in which from an excellent intention no doubt dantã sâ patriotic services were exaggerated and he was made out one of the most active agents of napoleonâ return it was evident that at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release him the petition finished m_noirtier_de_villefort read it aloud that will do said he leave the rest to me â will the petition go soon â today â countersigned by you â the best thing i can do will be to certify the truth of the contents of your petition and sitting down m_noirtier_de_villefort wrote the certificate at the bottom what more is to be done â i will do whatever is necessary this assurance delighted m_maximilian_morrel who took leave of m_noirtier_de_villefort and hastened to announce to old edmond_dantã_s that he would soon see his son as for m_noirtier_de_villefort instead of sending to paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised edmond_dantã_s in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikely that is a second restoration
dantã remained a prisoner and heard not the noise of the fall of louis_xviii s throne or the still more tragic destruction of the empire twice during the hundred day had m_maximilian_morrel renewed his demand and twice had m_noirtier_de_villefort soothed him with promises at last there was waterloo and m_maximilian_morrel came no more he had done all that was in his power and any fresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly louis_xviii remounted the throne m_noirtier_de_villefort to whom marseilles had become filled with remorseful memories sought and obtained the situation of kingâ procureur at toulouse and a fortnight afterwards he married mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars de madame_de_saint_mã_ran whose father now stood higher at court than ever and so edmond_dantã_s after the hundred day and after waterloo remained in his dungeon forgotten of earth and heaven mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed edmond_dantã_s and when napoleon returned to france he after the manner of mediocre mind termed the coincidence a decree of providence but when napoleon returned to paris danglarsâ heart failed him and he lived in constant fear of dantã sâ return on a mission of vengeance he therefore informed m_maximilian_morrel of his wish to quit the sea and obtained a recommendation from him to a spanish merchant into whose service he entered at the end of march that is ten or twelve day after napoleonâ return he then left for madrid and was no more heard of m_fernand_mondego understood nothing except that edmond_dantã_s was absent what had become of him he cared not to inquire
only during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him he reflected partly on the means of deceiving mercã_dã_s as to the cause of his absence partly on plans of emigration and abduction as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of cape pharo at the spot from whence marseilles and the catalans are visible watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man who was for him also the messenger of vengeance fernandâ mind was made up he would shoot edmond_dantã_s and then kill himself but m_fernand_mondego was mistaken a man of his disposition never kills himself for he constantly hopes during this time the empire made its last conscription and every man in france capable of bearing arm rushed to obey the summons of the emperor m_fernand_mondego departed with the rest bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away his rival would perhaps return and marry mercã_dã_s had m_fernand_mondego really meant to kill himself he would have done so when he parted from mercã_dã_s his devotion and the compassion he showed for her misfortunes produced the effect they always produce on noble mindsâ mercã_dã_s had always had a sincere regard for m_fernand_mondego and this was now strengthened by gratitude my brother said she as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders be careful of yourself for if you are killed i shall be alone in the world these word carried a ray of hope into fernandâ heart should edmond_dantã_s not return mercã_dã_s might one day be his 0165 mercã_dã_s was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never seemed so barren and the sea that had never seemed so vast bathed in tears she wandered about the catalan village
sometimes she stood mute and motionless as a statue looking towards marseilles at other time gazing on the sea and debating as to whether it were not better to cast herself into the abyss of the ocean and thus end her woes it was not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her m_caderousse was like m_fernand_mondego enrolled in the army but being married and eight year older he was merely sent to the frontier old edmond_dantã_s who was only sustained by hope lost all hope at napoleonâ downfall five month after he had been separated from his son and almost at the hour of his arrest he breathed his last in mercã dã sâ arm m_maximilian_morrel paid the expenses of his funeral and a few small debts the poor old man had contracted there was more than benevolence in this action there was courage the south was aflame and to assist even on his death bed the father of so dangerous a bonapartist as edmond_dantã_s was stigmatized as a crime chapter 14 the two prisoners a year after louis_xviii s restoration a visit was made by the inspector general of prisons edmond_dantã_s in his cell heard the noise of preparation sounds that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner who could hear the splash of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon he guessed something uncommon was passing among the living but he had so long ceased to have any intercourse with the world that he looked upon himself as dead
the inspector visited one after another the cells and dungeons of several of the prisoners whose good behavior or stupidity recommended them to the clemency of the government he inquired how they were fed and if they had any request to make the universal response was that the fare was detestable and that they wanted to be set free the inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for they shook their head what could they desire beyond their liberty the inspector turned smilingly to the governor i do not know what reason government can assign for these useless visits when you see one prisoner you see all always the same thing ill fed and innocent are there any others â_yes the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons â let us visit them said the inspector with an air of fatigue we must play the farce to the end let us see the dungeons â let us first send for two soldiers said the governor the prisoners sometimes through mere uneasiness of life and in order to be sentenced to death commit acts of useless violence and you might fall a victim â take all needful precautions replied the inspector two soldiers were accordingly sent for and the inspector descended a stairway so foul so humid so dark as to be loathsome to sight smell and respiration â_oh cried the inspector who can live here â a
most dangerous conspirator a man we are ordered to keep the most strict watch over as he is daring and resolute â he is alone â certainly â how long has he been there â nearly a year â was he placed here when he first arrived â no not until he attempted to kill the turnkey who took his food to him â to kill the turnkey â_yes the very one who is lighting us is it not true antoine asked the governor true enough he wanted to kill me returned the turnkey he must be mad said the inspector he is worse than that he is a devil returned the turnkey shall i complain of him demanded the inspector â_oh no it is useless besides he is almost mad now and in another year he will be quite so â so much the better for him he will suffer less said the inspector he was as this remark shows a man full of philanthropy and in every way fit for his office you are right sir replied the governor and this remark proves that you have deeply considered the subject now we have in a dungeon about twenty foot distant and to which you descend by another stair an old abbã formerly leader of a party in italy who has been here since 1811 and in 1813 he went mad and the change is astonishing he used to weep he now laughs he grew thin he now grows fat you had better see him for his madness is amusing â i will see them both returned the inspector i must conscientiously perform my duty this was the inspectorâ first visit he wished to display his authority let us visit this one first added he by
all means replied the governor and he signed to the turnkey to open the door at the sound of the key turning in the lock and the creaking of the hinges edmond_dantã_s who was crouched in a corner of the dungeon whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow iron grating above raised his head seeing a stranger escorted by two turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers and to whom the governor spoke bareheaded edmond_dantã_s who guessed the truth and that the moment to address himself to the superior authorities was come sprang forward with clasped hand the soldiers interposed their bayonets for they thought that he was about to attack the inspector and the latter recoiled two or three step edmond_dantã_s saw that he was looked upon as dangerous then infusing all the humility he possessed into his eye and voice he addressed the inspector and sought to inspire him with pity the inspector listened attentively then turning to the governor observed he will become religiousâ he is already more gentle he is afraid and retreated before the bayonetsâ madmen are not afraid of anything i made some curious observations on this at charenton then turning to the prisoner what is it you want said he i want to know what crime i have committedâ to be tried and if i am guilty to be shot if innocent to be set at liberty â are you well fed said the inspector i believe so i donâ know itâ of no consequence
what matters really not only to me but to officers of justice and the king is that an innocent man should languish in prison the victim of an infamous denunciation to die here cursing his executioners â you are very humble today remarked the governor you are not so always the other day for instance when you tried to kill the turnkey â_it is true sir and i beg his pardon for he has always been very good to me but i was mad â and you are not so any longer â no captivity has subdued meâ i have been here so long â so long when were you arrested then asked the inspector the 28th of february 1815 at half past two in the afternoon â today is the 30th of july 1816 why it is but seventeen month â only seventeen month replied edmond_dantã_s â_oh you do not know what is seventeen month in prison seventeen ages rather especially to a man who like me had arrived at the summit of his ambitionâ to a man who like me was on the point of marrying a woman he adored who saw an honorable career opened before him and who loses all in an instantâ who sees his prospects destroyed and is ignorant of the fate of his affianced wife and whether his aged father be still living seventeen monthsâ captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean is a worse punishment than human crime ever merited have pity on me then and ask for me not intelligence but a trial not pardon but a verdictâ a trial sir i ask only for a trial that surely cannot be denied to one who is accused â we shall see said the inspector then turning to the governor on my word the poor devil touches me
you must show me the proofs against him â certainly but you will find terrible charges â monsieur_albert continued edmond_dantã_s i know it is not in your power to release me but you can plead for meâ you can have me triedâ and that is all i ask let me know my crime and the reason why i was condemned uncertainty is worse than all â go on with the light said the inspector monsieur_albert cried edmond_dantã_s i can tell by your voice you are touched with pity tell me at least to hope â i cannot tell you that replied the inspector i can only promise to examine into your case â_oh i am freeâ then i am saved â who arrested you â m_noirtier_de_villefort see him and hear what he says â m_noirtier_de_villefort is no longer at marseilles he is now at toulouse â i am no longer surprised at my detention murmured edmond_dantã_s since my only protector is removed â had m_noirtier_de_villefort any cause of personal dislike to you â none on the contrary he was very kind to me â i can then rely on the notes he has left concerning you â entirely â that is well wait patiently then edmond_dantã_s fell on his knees and prayed earnestly the door closed but this time a fresh inmate was left with dantã sâ hope 0173 â will you see the register at once asked the governor or proceed to the other cell â let us visit them all said the inspector if i once went up those stairs i should never have the courage to come down again â ah this one is not like the other and his madness is less affecting than this oneâ display of reason â what is his folly â he fancies he possesses an immense treasure
the first year he offered government a million of franc for his release the second two the third three and so on progressively he is now in his fifth year of captivity he will ask to speak to you in private and offer you five millions â how curious what is his name â the abbã_faria â no 27 said the inspector â_it is here unlock the door antoine the turnkey obeyed and the inspector gazed curiously into the chamber of the mad abbã as the prisoner was usually called in the centre of the cell in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the wall sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely covered him he was drawing in this circle geometrical lines and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as archimedes was when the soldier of marcellus slew him he did not move at the sound of the door and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre wall of his cell then raising his head he perceived with astonishment the number of person present he hastily seized the coverlet of his bed and wrapped it round him what is it you want said the inspector i monsieur_albert replied the abbã with an air of surprise â i want nothing â you do not understand continued the inspector i am sent here by government to visit the prison and hear the requests of the prisoners â_oh that is different cried the abbã and we shall understand each other i hope â there now whispered the governor â_it is just as i told you â monsieur_albert continued the prisoner i am the abbã_faria born at rome
i was for twenty year cardinal spadaâ secretary i was arrested why i know not toward the beginning of the year 1811 since then i have demanded my liberty from the italian and french government â why from the french government â because i was arrested at piombino and i presume that like milan and florence piombino has become the capital of some french department â ah said the inspector you have not the latest news from italy â my information dates from the day on which i was arrested returned the abbã_faria and as the emperor had created the kingdom of rome for his infant son i presume that he has realized the dream of machiavelli and cã_sar_borgia which was to make italy a united kingdom â monsieur_albert returned the inspector providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warmly â_it is the only means of rendering italy strong happy and independent â very possibly only i am not come to discuss politics but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of â the food is the same as in other prisons that is very bad the lodging is very unhealthful but on the whole passable for a dungeon but it is not that which i wish to speak of but a secret i have to reveal of the greatest importance â we are coming to the point whispered the governor â_it is for that reason i am delighted to see you continued the abbã although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation which if it succeeded would possibly change newtonâ system could you allow me a few word in private â what did i tell you said the governor you knew him returned the inspector with a smile what you ask is impossible monsieur_albert continued he addressing abbã_faria
0175 â but said the abbã i would speak to you of a large sum amounting to five millions â the very sum you named whispered the inspector in his turn however continued abbã_faria seeing that the inspector was about to depart â_it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone the governor can be present â unfortunately said the governor i know beforehand what you are about to say it concerns your treasures does it not abbã_faria fixed his eye on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his sanity of course said he of what else should i speak â mr inspector continued the governor i can tell you the story as well as he for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five year â that proves returned the abbã that you are like those of holy writ who having eye see not and having ears hear not â my dear sir the government is rich and does not want your treasures replied the inspector keep them until you are liberated the abbã s eye glistened he seized the inspectorâ hand but what if i am not liberated cried he and am detained here until my death this treasure will be lost had not government better profit by it i will offer six millions and i will content myself with the rest if they will only give me my liberty â on my word said the inspector in a low tone had i not been told beforehand that this man was mad i should believe what he says â i am not mad replied abbã_faria with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to prisoners
â the treasure i speak of really exists and i offer to sign an agreement with you in which i promise to lead you to the spot where you shall dig and if i deceive you bring me here again i ask no more the governor laughed is the spot far from here â a hundred leagues â_it is not ill planned said the governor if all the prisoners took it into their head to travel a hundred leagues and their guardians consented to accompany them they would have a capital chance of escaping â the scheme is well known said the inspector and the abbã s plan has not even the merit of originality then turning to abbã_faria i inquired if you are well fed said he swear to me replied abbã_faria to free me if what i tell you prove true and i will stay here while you go to the spot â are you well fed repeated the inspector monsieur_albert you run no risk for as i told you i will stay here so there is no chance of my escaping â you do not reply to my question replied the inspector impatiently nor you to mine cried the abbã you will not accept my gold i will keep it for myself you refuse me my liberty god will give it me and the abbã casting away his coverlet resumed his place and continued his calculations 0177 â what is he doing there said the inspector counting his treasures replied the governor abbã_faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt they went out the turnkey closed the door behind them he was wealthy once perhaps said the inspector or dreamed he was and awoke mad â after all said the inspector if he had been rich he would not have been here
so the matter ended for the abbã_faria he remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity caligula or nero those treasure seekers those desirers of the impossible would have accorded to the poor wretch in exchange for his wealth the liberty he so earnestly prayed for but the kings of modern time restrained by the limits of mere probability have neither courage nor desire they fear the ear that hears their order and the eye that scrutinizes their actions formerly they believed themselves sprung from jupiter and shielded by their birth but nowadays they are not inviolable it has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer the victims of their persecutions to reappear as the inquisition rarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their flesh lacerated by torture so madness is always concealed in its cell from whence should it depart it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being the jailer delivers to him the very madness of the abbã_faria gone mad in prison condemned him to perpetual captivity the inspector kept his word with edmond_dantã_s he examined the register and found the following note concerning him edmond_dantã_s violent bonapartist took an active part in the return from elba the greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised this note was in a different hand from the rest which showed that it had been added since his confinement the inspector could not contend against this accusation he simply wrote nothing to be done
this visit had infused new vigor into edmond_dantã_s he had till then forgotten the date but now with a fragment of plaster he wrote the date 30th july 1816 and made a mark every day in order not to lose his reckoning again day and weeks passed away then monthsâ edmond_dantã_s still waited he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight this fortnight expired he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to paris and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished he therefore fixed three month three month passed away then six more finally ten month and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place and edmond_dantã_s began to fancy the inspectorâ visit but a dream an illusion of the brain at the expiration of a year the governor was transferred he had obtained charge of the fortress at ham he took with him several of his subordinates and amongst them dantã sâ jailer a new governor arrived it would have been too tedious to acquire the name of the prisoners he learned their numbers instead this horrible place contained fifty cells their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell and the unhappy young man was no longer called edmond_dantã_s dantã sâ he was now number 34 chapter 15 number 34 and number 27 edmond_dantã_s passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in suspense he was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the sequence to hope then he began to doubt his own innocence which justified in some measure the governorâ belief in his mental alienation and then relaxing his sentiment of pride he addressed his supplications not to god but to man god is always the last resource
unfortunates who ought to begin with god do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance edmond_dantã_s asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another even if it were darker and deeper for a change however disadvantageous was still a change and would afford him some amusement he entreated to be allowed to walk about to have fresh air books and writing materials his requests were not granted but he went on asking all the same he accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer although the latter was if possible more taciturn than the old one but still to speak to a man even though mute was something edmond_dantã_s spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice he had tried to speak when alone but the sound of his voice terrified him often before his captivity dantã sâ mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners made up of thieves vagabonds and murderers he now wished to be amongst them in order to see some other face besides that of his jailer he sighed for the galleys with the infamous costume the chain and the brand on the shoulder the galley slaves breathed the fresh air of heaven and saw each other they were very happy he besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion were it even the mad abbã the jailer though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering was yet a man
at the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so and he laid the request of number 34 before the governor but the latter sapiently imagined that edmond_dantã_s wished to conspire or attempt an escape and refused his request edmond_dantã_s had exhausted all human resources and he then turned to god all the pious idea that had been so long forgotten returned he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him and discovered a new meaning in every word for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of word until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven he prayed and prayed aloud no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice for he fell into a sort of ecstasy he laid every action of his life before the almighty proposed tasks to accomplish and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to god forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us yet in spite of his earnest prayers edmond_dantã_s remained a prisoner then gloom settled heavily upon him edmond_dantã_s was a man of great simplicity of thought and without education he could not therefore in the solitude of his dungeon traverse in mental vision the history of the ages bring to life the nations that had perished and rebuild the ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the imagination and that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors in martinâ babylonian pictures he could not do this he whose past life was so short whose present so melancholy and his future so doubtful
nineteen year of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness no distraction could come to his aid his energetic spirit that would have exalted in thus revisiting the past was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage he clung to one ideaâ that of his happiness destroyed without apparent cause by an unheard of fatality he considered and reconsidered this idea devoured it so to speak as the implacable ugolino devours the skull of archbishop roger in the inferno of dante rage supplanted religious fervor edmond_dantã_s uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror dashed himself furiously against the wall of his prison wreaked his anger upon everything and chiefly upon himself so that the least thing a grain of sand a straw or a breath of air that annoyed him led to paroxysms of fury then the letter that m_noirtier_de_villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind and every line gleamed forth in fiery letter on the wall like the mene mene tekel upharsin of belshazzar he told himself that it was the enmity of man and not the vengeance of heaven that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery he consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine and found them all insufficient because after torture came death and after death if not repose at least the boon of unconsciousness by dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be invented he began to reflect on suicide unhappy he who on the brink of misfortune broods over idea like these
before him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition once thus ensnared unless the protecting hand of god snatch him thence all is over and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction this state of mental anguish is however less terrible than the sufferings that precede or the punishment that possibly will follow there is a sort of consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss at the bottom of which lie darkness and obscurity edmond_dantã_s found some solace in these idea all his sorrows all his sufferings with their train of gloomy spectres fled from his cell when the angel of death seemed about to enter edmond_dantã_s reviewed his past life with composure and looking forward with terror to his future existence chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge sometimes said he in my voyages when i was a man and commanded other man i have seen the heavens overcast the sea rage and foam the storm arise and like a monstrous bird beating the two horizons with its wings then i felt that my vessel was a vain refuge that trembled and shook before the tempest soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death and death then terrified me and i used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of god
but i did so because i was happy because i had not courted death because to be cast upon a bed of rocks and seaweed seemed terrible because i was unwilling that i a creature made for the service of god should serve for food to the gulls and ravens but now it is different i have lost all that bound me to life death smile and invites me to repose i die after my own manner i die exhausted and broken spirited as i fall asleep when i have paced three thousand time round my cell that is thirty thousand step or about ten leagues no sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed arranged his couch to the best of his power ate little and slept less and found existence almost supportable because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure like a worn out garment two methods of self destruction were at his disposal he could hang himself with his handkerchief to the window bars or refuse food and die of starvation but the first was repugnant to him edmond_dantã_s had always entertained the greatest horror of pirates who are hung up to the yard arm he would not die by what seemed an infamous death he resolved to adopt the second and began that day to carry out his resolve 0185 nearly four year had passed away at the end of the second he had ceased to mark the lapse of time edmond_dantã_s said i wish to die and had chosen the manner of his death and fearful of changing his mind he had taken an oath to die
â when my morning and evening meals are brought thought he i will cast them out of the window and they will think that i have eaten them he kept his word twice a day he cast out through the barred aperture the provisions his jailer brought himâ at first gayly then with deliberation and at last with regret nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed hunger made viands once repugnant now acceptable he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat of tainted fish of black and mouldy bread it was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair then his dungeon seemed less sombre his prospects less desperate he was still youngâ he was only four or five and twentyâ he had nearly fifty year to live what unforseen events might not open his prison door and restore him to liberty then he raised to his lip the repast that like a voluntary tantalus he refused himself but he thought of his oath and he would not break it he persisted until at last he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole the next morning he could not see or hear the jailer feared he was dangerously ill edmond_dantã_s hoped he was dying thus the day passed away edmond_dantã_s felt a sort of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a feeling almost of content the gnawing pain at his stomach had ceased his thirst had abated when he closed his eye he saw myriads of light dancing before them like the will oâ the wisps that play about the marshes it was the twilight of that mysterious country called death
suddenly about nine oâ clock in the evening edmond_dantã_s heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was lying so many loathsome animals inhabited the prison that their noise did not in general awake him but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties or whether the noise was really louder than usual edmond_dantã_s raised his head and listened it was a continual scratching as if made by a huge claw a powerful tooth or some iron instrument attacking the stones although weakened the young manâ brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisonersâ liberty it seemed to him that heaven had at length taken pity on him and had sent this noise to warn him on the very brink of the abyss perhaps one of those beloved one he had so often thought of was thinking of him and striving to diminish the distance that separated them no no doubtless he was deceived and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death edmond_dantã_s still heard the sound it lasted nearly three hour he then heard a noise of something falling and all was silent some hour afterwards it began again nearer and more distinct edmond_dantã_s was intensely interested suddenly the jailer entered for a week since he had resolved to die and during the four day that he had been carrying out his purpose edmond_dantã_s had not spoken to the attendant had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moment the jailer brought him his breakfast
dantã raised himself up and began to talk about everything about the bad quality of the food about the coldness of his dungeon grumbling and complaining in order to have an excuse for speaking louder and wearying the patience of his jailer who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner fortunately he fancied that edmond_dantã_s was delirious and placing the food on the rickety table he withdrew edmond_dantã_s listened and the sound became more and more distinct there can be no doubt about it thought he â_it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom oh if i were only there to help him suddenly another idea took possession of his mind so used to misfortune that it was scarcely capable of hopeâ the idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring dungeon it was easy to ascertain this but how could he risk the question it was easy to call his jailerâ attention to the noise and watch his countenance as he listened but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the short lived satisfaction of his own curiosity unfortunately edmondâ brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular he saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment he turned his eye towards the soup which the jailer had brought rose staggered towards it raised the vessel to his lip and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure he had the resolution to stop with this he had often heard that shipwrecked person had died through having eagerly devoured too much food
edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour and returned to his couchâ he did not wish to die he soon felt that his idea became again collectedâ he could think and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning then he said to himself i must put this to the test but without compromising anybody if it is a workman i need but knock against the wall and he will cease to work in order to find out who is knocking and why he does so but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor he will soon resume it if on the contrary it is a prisoner the noise i make will alarm him he will cease and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep edmond_dantã_s rose again but this time his legs did not tremble and his sight was clear he went to a corner of his dungeon detached a stone and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came he struck thrice at the first blow the sound ceased as if by magic edmond_dantã_s listened intently an hour passed two hour passed and no sound was heard from the wallâ all was silent there full of hope edmond_dantã_s swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water and thanks to the vigor of his constitution found himself well nigh recovered the day passed away in utter silenceâ night came without recurrence of the noise â_it is a prisoner said edmond_dantã_s joyfully his brain was on fire and life and energy returned the night passed in perfect silence edmond_dantã_s did not close his eye
in the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisionsâ he had already devoured those of the previous day he ate these listening anxiously for the sound walking round and round his cell shaking the iron bars of the loophole restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise and so preparing himself for his future destiny at intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again and grew impatient at the prudence of the prisoner who did not guess he had been disturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as himself three day passedâ seventy two long tedious hour which he counted off by minute at length one evening as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that night edmond_dantã_s with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones he moved away walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts and then went back and listened the matter was no longer doubtful something was at work on the other side of the wall the prisoner had discovered the danger and had substituted a lever for a chisel encouraged by this discovery edmond_dantã_s determined to assist the indefatigable laborer he began by moving his bed and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall penetrate the moist cement and displace a stone he saw nothing he had no knife or sharp instrument the window grating was of iron but he had too often assured himself of its solidity all his furniture consisted of a bed a chair a table a pail and a jug the bed had iron clamps but they were screwed to the wood and it would have required a screw driver to take them off
the table and chair had nothing the pail had once possessed a handle but that had been removed 0189 edmond_dantã_s had but one resource which was to break the jug and with one of the sharp fragments attack the wall he let the jug fall on the floor and it broke in pieces edmond_dantã_s concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed leaving the rest on the floor the breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite suspicion edmond_dantã_s had all the night to work in but in the darkness he could not do much and he soon felt that he was working against something very hard he pushed back his bed and waited for day all night he heard the subterranean workman who continued to mine his way day came the jailer entered edmond_dantã_s told him that the jug had fallen from his hand while he was drinking and the jailer went grumblingly to fetch another without giving himself the trouble to remove the fragments of the broken one he returned speedily advised the prisoner to be more careful and departed edmond_dantã_s heard joyfully the key grate in the lock he listened until the sound of step died away and then hastily displacing his bed saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell that he had labored uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it
the damp had rendered it friable and edmond_dantã_s was able to break it offâ in small morsels it is true but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful a mathematician might have calculated that in two year supposing that the rock was not encountered a passage twenty foot long and two foot broad might be formed the prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hour he had passed in vain hopes prayer and despondency during the six year that he had been imprisoned what might he not have accomplished this idea imparted new energy and in three day he had succeeded with the utmost precaution in removing the cement and exposing the stone work the wall was built of rough stones among which to give strength to the structure blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbedded it was one of these he had uncovered and which he must remove from its socket edmond_dantã_s strove to do this with his nails but they were too weak the fragments of the jug broke and after an hour of useless toil edmond_dantã_s paused with anguish on his brow was he to be thus stopped at the beginning and was he to wait inactive until his fellow workman had completed his task suddenly an idea occurred to himâ he smiled and the perspiration dried on his forehead the jailer always brought dantã sâ soup in an iron saucepan this saucepan contained soup for both prisoners for edmond_dantã_s had noticed that it was either quite full or half empty according as the turnkey gave it to him or to his companion first the handle of this saucepan was of iron edmond_dantã_s would have given ten year of his life in exchange for it 0191 m
the jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into dantã sâ plate and edmond_dantã_s after eating his soup with a wooden spoon washed the plate which thus served for every day now when evening came edmond_dantã_s put his plate on the ground near the door the jailer as he entered stepped on it and broke it this time he could not blame edmond_dantã_s he was wrong to leave it there but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him the jailer therefore only grumbled then he looked about for something to pour the soup into dantã sâ entire dinner service consisted of one plateâ there was no alternative leave the saucepan said edmond_dantã_s you can take it away when you bring me my breakfast this advice was to the jailerâ taste as it spared him the necessity of making another trip he left the saucepan edmond_dantã_s was beside himself with joy he rapidly devoured his food and after waiting an hour lest the jailer should change his mind and return he removed his bed took the handle of the saucepan inserted the point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall and employed it as a lever a slight oscillation showed edmond_dantã_s that all went well at the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter edmond_dantã_s carefully collected the plaster carried it into the corner of his cell and covered it with earth then wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor he continued to work without ceasing at the dawn of day he replaced the stone pushed his bed against the wall and lay down
the breakfast consisted of a piece of bread the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table well donâ you intend to bring me another plate said edmond_dantã_s no replied the turnkey you destroy everything first you break your jug then you make me break your plate if all the prisoners followed your example the government would be ruined i shall leave you the saucepan and pour your soup into that so for the future i hope you will not be so destructive edmond_dantã_s raised his eye to heaven and clasped his hand beneath the coverlet he felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for anything he had noticed however that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor no matter this was a greater reason for proceedingâ if his neighbor would not come to him he would go to his neighbor all day he toiled on untiringly and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone when the hour for his jailerâ visit arrived edmond_dantã_s straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could and placed it in its accustomed place the turnkey poured his ration of soup into it together with the fishâ for thrice a week the prisoners were deprived of meat this would have been a method of reckoning time had not edmond_dantã_s long ceased to do so having poured out the soup the turnkey retired edmond_dantã_s wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to work he listenedâ all was silent as it had been for the last three day edmond_dantã_s sighed it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him
however he toiled on all the night without being discouraged but after two or three hour he encountered an obstacle the iron made no impression but met with a smooth surface edmond_dantã_s touched it and found that it was a beam this beam crossed or rather blocked up the hole edmond_dantã_s had made it was necessary therefore to dig above or under it the unhappy young man had not thought of this â_oh my god my god murmured he i have so earnestly prayed to you that i hoped my prayers had been heard after having deprived me of my liberty after having deprived me of death after having recalled me to existence my god have pity on me and do not let me die in despair 0193m who talks of god and despair at the same time said a voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth and deadened by the distance sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young manâ ears edmondâ hair stood on end and he rose to his knees ah said he i hear a human voice edmond_dantã_s had not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five year and a jailer is no man to a prisonerâ he is a living door a barrier of flesh and blood adding strength to restraints of oak and iron in the name of heaven cried edmond_dantã_s speak again though the sound of your voice terrifies me who are you â who are you said the voice an unhappy prisoner replied edmond_dantã_s who made no hesitation in answering of what country â a frenchman â your name â edmond_dantã_s â your profession â a sailor â how long have you been here â since the 28th of february 1815 â your crime â i am innocent â but of what are you accused â of
having conspired to aid the emperorâ return â what for the emperorâ return the emperor is no longer on the throne then â he abdicated at fontainebleau in 1814 and was sent to the island of elba but how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this â since 1811 edmond_dantã_s shuddered this man had been four year longer than himself in prison do not dig any more said the voice only tell me how high up is your excavation â on a level with the floor â how is it concealed â behind my bed â has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner â no â what does your chamber open on â a corridor â and the corridor â on a court â alas murmured the voice â_oh what is the matter cried edmond_dantã_s i have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans i took the wrong angle and have come out fifteen foot from where i intended i took the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress â but then you would be close to the sea â that is what i hoped â and supposing you had succeeded â i should have thrown myself into the sea gained one of the islands near hereâ the isle de daume or the isle de tiboulenâ and then i should have been safe â could you have swum so far â heaven would have given me strength but now all is lost â all â_yes stop up your excavation carefully do not work any more and wait until you hear from me â tell me at least who you are â i amâ i am no 27 â you mistrust me then said edmond_dantã_s edmond_dantã_s fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths â_oh i am a christian cried edmond_dantã_s guessing instinctively that this man meant to abandon him
â i swear to you by him who died for us that naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers but i conjure you do not abandon me if you do i swear to you for i have got to the end of my strength that i will dash my brains out against the wall and you will have my death to reproach yourself with â how old are you your voice is that of a young man â i do not know my age for i have not counted the year i have been here all i do know is that i was just nineteen when i was arrested the 28th of february 1815 â not quite twenty six murmured the voice at that age he cannot be a traitor â_oh no no cried edmond_dantã_s i swear to you again rather than betray you i would allow myself to be hacked in pieces â you have done well to speak to me and ask for my assistance for i was about to form another plan and leave you but your age reassures me i will not forget you wait â how long â i must calculate our chances i will give you the signal â but you will not leave me you will come to me or you will let me come to you we will escape and if we cannot escape we will talk you of those whom you love and i of those whom i love you must love somebody â no i am alone in the world â then you will love me if you are young i will be your comrade if you are old i will be your son i have a father who is seventy if he yet life i only love him and a young girl called mercã_dã_s
my father has not yet forgotten me i am sure but god alone knows if she loves me still i shall love you as i loved my father â_it is well returned the voice tomorrow these few word were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity edmond_dantã_s rose dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before and pushed his bed back against the wall he then gave himself up to his happiness he would no longer be alone he was perhaps about to regain his liberty at the worst he would have a companion and captivity that is shared is but half captivity plaints made in common are almost prayers and prayers where two or three are gathered together invoke the mercy of heaven all day edmond_dantã_s walked up and down his cell he sat down occasionally on his bed pressing his hand on his heart at the slightest noise he bounded towards the door once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown whom he loved already and then his mind was made upâ when the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening he would kill him with his water jug he would be condemned to die but he was about to die of grief and despair when this miraculous noise recalled him to life the jailer came in the evening edmond_dantã_s was on his bed it seemed to him that thus he better guarded the unfinished opening doubtless there was a strange expression in his eye for the jailer said come are you going mad again edmond_dantã_s did not answer he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him the jailer went away shaking his head
night came edmond_dantã_s hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him but he was mistaken the next morning however just as he removed his bed from the wall he heard three knocks he threw himself on his knees is it you said he i am here â is your jailer gone â_yes said edmond_dantã_s he will not return until the evening so that we have twelve hour before us â i can work then said the voice â_oh yes yes this instant i entreat you in a moment that part of the floor on which edmond_dantã_s was resting his two hand as he knelt with his head in the opening suddenly gave way he drew back smartly while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of a man who sprang lightly into his cell 0197 chapter 16 a learned italian seizing in his arm the friend so long and ardently desired edmond_dantã_s almost carried him towards the window in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through the grating he was a man of small stature with hair blanched rather by suffering and sorrow than by age he had a deep set penetrating eye almost buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow and a long and still black beard reaching down to his breast his thin face deeply furrowed by care and the bold outline of his strongly marked features betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical strength
large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned the stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty five year but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time he received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent he thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty let us first see said he whether it is possible to remove the traces of my entrance hereâ our future tranquillity depends upon our jailers being entirely ignorant of it advancing to the opening he stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its weight then fitting it into its place he said you removed this stone very carelessly but i suppose you had no tools to aid you â why exclaimed edmond_dantã_s with astonishment do you possess any â i made myself some and with the exception of a file i have all that are necessary a chisel pincers and lever 0201m â_oh how i should like to see these products of your industry and patience â well in the first place here is my chisel so saying he displayed a sharp strong blade with a handle made of beechwood and with what did you contrive to make that inquired edmond_dantã_s
â with one of the clamps of my bedstead and this very tool has sufficed me to hollow out the road by which i came hither a distance of about fifty foot â fifty foot responded edmond_dantã_s almost terrified do not speak so loud young manâ donâ speak so loud it frequently occurs in a state prison like this that person are stationed outside the door of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the prisoners â but they believe i am shut up alone here â that makes no difference â and you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty foot to get here â i do that is about the distance that separates your chamber from mine only unfortunately i did not curve aright for want of the necessary geometrical instruments to calculate my scale of proportion instead of taking an ellipsis of forty foot i made it fifty i expected as i told you to reach the outer wall pierce through it and throw myself into the sea i have however kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens instead of going beneath it my labor is all in vain for i find that the corridor look into a courtyard filled with soldiers â thatâ true said edmond_dantã_s but the corridor you speak of only bounds one side of my cell there are three othersâ do you know anything of their situation â this one is built against the solid rock and it would take ten experienced miners duly furnished with the requisite tools as many year to perforate it this adjoins the lower part of the governorâ apartments and were we to work our way through we should only get into some lock up cellars where we must necessarily be recaptured
the fourth and last side of your cell face onâ face onâ stop a minute now where does it face the wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole by which light was admitted to the chamber this loophole which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside to an opening through which a child could not have passed was for better security furnished with three iron bars so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisonerâ escape as the stranger asked the question he dragged the table beneath the window climb up said he to edmond_dantã_s the young man obeyed mounted on the table and divining the wishes of his companion placed his back securely against the wall and held out both hand the stranger whom as yet edmond_dantã_s knew only by the number of his cell sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his year and light and steady on his foot as a cat or a lizard climbed from the table to the outstretched hand of edmond_dantã_s and from them to his shoulders then bending double for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom an instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head saying i thought so and sliding from the shoulders of edmond_dantã_s as dextrously as he had ascended he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground what was it that you thought asked the young man anxiously in his turn descending from the table
the elder prisoner pondered the matter â_yes said he at length â_it is so this side of your chamber look out upon a kind of open gallery where patrols are continually passing and sentries keep watch day and night â are you quite sure of that â certain i saw the soldierâ shape and the top of his musket that made me draw in my head so quickly for i was fearful he might also see me â well inquired edmond_dantã_s you perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon â thenâ â pursued the young man eagerly then answered the elder prisoner the will of god be done and as the old man slowly pronounced those word an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance edmond_dantã_s gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration tell me i entreat of you who and what you are said he at length never have i met with so remarkable a person as yourself â willingly answered the stranger if indeed you feel any curiosity respecting one now alas powerless to aid you in any way â say not so you can console and support me by the strength of your own powerful mind pray let me know who you really are the stranger smiled a melancholy smile then listen said he i am the abbã_faria and have been imprisoned as you know in this chã teau dâ if since the year 1811 previously to which i had been confined for three year in the fortress of fenestrelle in the year 1811 i was transferred to piedmont in france it was at this period
i learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by napoleon had bestowed on him a son named king of rome even in his cradle i was very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of namely that four year afterwards this colossus of power would be overthrown then who reigns in france at this momentâ napoleon ii â no louis_xviii â the brother of louis_xviii xvi how inscrutable are the way of providenceâ for what great and mysterious purpose has it pleased heaven to abase the man once so elevated and raise up him who was so abased dantã sâ whole attention was riveted on a man who could thus forget his own misfortunes while occupying himself with the destinies of others â_yes yes continued he â twill be the same as it was in england after charles i cromwell after cromwell charles ii and then james ii and then some son in law or relation some prince of orange a stadtholder who becomes a king then new concessions to the people then a constitution then liberty ah my friend said the abbã turning towards edmond_dantã_s and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet you are young you will see all this come to pass â probably if ever i get out of prison â true replied abbã_faria we are prisoners but i forget this sometimes and there are even moment when my mental vision transports me beyond these wall and i fancy myself at liberty â but wherefore are you here â because
in 1807 i dreamed of the very plan napoleon tried to realize in 1811 because like machiavelli i desired to alter the political face of italy and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler i sought to form one large compact and powerful empire and lastly because i fancied i had found my cã_sar_borgia in a crowned simpleton who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me it was the plan of alexander_vi and clement vii but it will never succeed now for they attempted it fruitlessly and napoleon was unable to complete his work italy seems fated to misfortune and the old man bowed his head edmond_dantã_s could not understand a man risking his life for such matters napoleon certainly he knew something of inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him but of clement vii and alexander_vi he knew nothing are you not he asked the priest who here in the chã teau dâ if is generally thought to beâ ill â mad you mean donâ you â i did not like to say so answered edmond_dantã_s smiling
â well then resumed abbã_faria with a bitter smile let me answer your question in full by acknowledging that i am the poor mad prisoner of the chã teau dâ if for many year permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity and in all probability i should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the child if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and despair edmond_dantã_s remained for a short time mute and motionless at length he said then you abandon all hope of escape â i perceive its utter impossibility and i consider it impious to attempt that which the almighty evidently does not approve â nay be not discouraged would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed â alas it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated that you talk of beginning over again in the first place i was four year making the tools i possess and have been two year scraping and digging out earth hard as granite itself then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge stones i should once have deemed impossible to loosen whole day have i passed in these titanic efforts considering my labor well repaid if by night time i had contrived to carry away a square inch of this hard bound cement changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the stones themselves then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish
i dug up i was compelled to break through a staircase and throw the fruits of my labor into the hollow part of it but the well is now so completely choked up that i scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to discovery consider also that i fully believed i had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking for which i had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise and now at the moment when i reckoned upon success my hopes are forever dashed from me no i repeat again that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the almightyâ pleasure edmond_dantã_s held down his head that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbã s plans the abbã sank upon edmondâ bed while edmond_dantã_s himself remained standing escape had never once occurred to him there are indeed some thing which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant
to undermine the ground for fifty feetâ to devote three year to a labor which if successful would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the seaâ to plunge into the waves from the height of fifty sixty perhaps a hundred foot at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels and even supposing all these perils past then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shoreâ were difficulties so startling and formidable that edmond_dantã_s had never even dreamed of such a scheme resigning himself rather to death but the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage gave a fresh turn to his idea and inspired him with new courage another older and less strong than he had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake and had failed only because of an error in calculation this same person with almost incredible patience and perseverance had contrived to provide himself with tools requisite for so unparalleled an attempt another had done all this why then was it impossible to edmond_dantã_s
faria had dug his way through fifty foot edmond_dantã_s would dig a hundred abbã_faria at the age of fifty had devoted three year to the task he who was but half as old would sacrifice six abbã_faria a priest and savant had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islandsâ daume rattonneau or lemaire should a hardy sailor an experienced diver like himself shrink from a similar task should he who had so often for mere amusementâ sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch hesitate to entertain the same project he could do it in an hour and how many time had he for pure pastime continued in the water for more than twice as long at once edmond_dantã_s resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion and to remember that what has once been done may be done again after continuing some time in profound meditation the young man suddenly exclaimed i have found what you were in search of abbã_faria started have you indeed cried he raising his head with quick anxiety pray let me know what it is you have discovered â the corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you occupy here extends in the same direction as the outer gallery does it not 0207m â_it does â and is not above fifteen foot from it â about that â well then i will tell you what we must do we must pierce through the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle as it were the top part of a cross
this time you will lay your plans more accurately we shall get out into the gallery you have described kill the sentinel who guards it and make our escape all we require to insure success is courage and that you possess and strength which i am not deficient in as for patience you have abundantly proved yoursâ you shall now see me prove mine â one instant my dear friend replied the abbã â_it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which i am endowed and what use i intend making of my strength as for patience i consider that i have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of the night before and every night renewing the task of the day but then young man and i pray of you to give me your full attention then i thought i could not be doing anything displeasing to the almighty in trying to set an innocent being at libertyâ one who had committed no offence and merited not condemnation â and have your notions changed asked edmond_dantã_s with much surprise do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me â no neither do i wish to incur guilt hitherto i have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances not man i have thought it no sin to bore through a wall or destroy a staircase but i cannot so easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life a slight movement of surprise escaped edmond_dantã_s is it possible
â said he that where your liberty is at stake you can allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it â tell me replied abbã_faria what has hindered you from knocking down your jailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead dressing yourself in his clothes and endeavoring to escape â simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me answered edmond_dantã_s because said the old man the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it and so it ever is because in simple and allowable thing our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty the tiger whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim but man on the contrary loathes the idea of bloodâ it is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a shrinking dread of taking life his natural construction and physiological formationâ â edmond_dantã_s was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind or rather soul for there are two distinct sorts of idea those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart 0209 â since my imprisonment said abbã_faria i have thought over all the most celebrated cases of escape on record they have rarely been successful
those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon and carefully arranged such for instance as the escape of the duc de beaufort from the chã teau de vincennes that of the abbã dubuquoi from for lâ evãªque of latude from the bastille then there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity and those are the best of all let us therefore wait patiently for some favorable moment and when it presents itself profit by it â ah said edmond_dantã_s you might well endure the tedious delay you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself and when weary with toil you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you â i assure you replied the old man i did not turn to that source for recreation or support â what did you do then â i wrote or studied â were you then permitted the use of pens ink and paper â_oh no answered the abbã i had none but what i made for myself â you made paper pens and ink â_yes edmond_dantã_s gazed with admiration but he had some difficulty in believing abbã_faria saw this when you pay me a visit in my cell my young friend said he i will show you an entire work the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of my whole life many of them meditated over in the shades of the colosseum at rome at the foot of st markâ column at venice and on the borders of the arno at florence little imagining at the time that they would be arranged in order within the wall of the chã teau dâ if
the work i speak of is called a treatise on the possibility of a general monarchy in italy and will make one large quarto volume â and on what have you written all this â on two of my shirts i invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as parchment â you are then a chemist â somewhat i know lavoisier and was the intimate friend of cabanis â but for such a work you must have needed booksâ had you any â i had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at rome but after reading them over many time i found out that with one hundred and fifty well chosen books a man possesses if not a complete summary of all human knowledge at least all that a man need really know i devoted three year of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes till i knew them nearly by heart so that since i have been in prison a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me i could recite you the whole of thucydides xenophon plutarch titus livius tacitus strada jornandes dante montaigne shakespeare spinoza machiavelli and bossuet i name only the most important â you are doubtless acquainted with a variety of languages so as to have been able to read all these â_yes i speak five of the modern tonguesâ that is to say german french italian english and spanish by the aid of ancient greek i learned modern greekâ i donâ speak it so well as i could wish but i am still trying to improve myself â improve yourself repeated edmond_dantã_s why how can you manage to do so â why
i made a vocabulary of the word i knew turned returned and arranged them so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their medium i know nearly one thousand word which is all that is absolutely necessary although i believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the dictionaries i cannot hope to be very fluent but i certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes and that would be quite as much as i should ever require stronger grew the wonder of edmond_dantã_s who almost fancied he had to do with one gifted with supernatural powers still hoping to find some imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings he added then if you were not furnished with pens how did you manage to write the work you speak of â i made myself some excellent one which would be universally preferred to all others if once known you are aware what huge whitings are served to us on maigre day well i selected the cartilages of the head of these fishes and you can scarcely imagine the delight with which i welcomed the arrival of each wednesday friday and saturday as affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens for i will freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest solace and relief while retracing the past i forget the present and traversing at will the path of history i cease to remember that i am myself a prisoner â but the ink said edmond_dantã_s of what did you make your ink â there was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon replied abbã_faria but it was closed up long ere i became an occupant of this prison
still it must have been many year in use for it was thickly covered with a coating of soot this soot i dissolved in a portion of the wine brought to me every sunday and i assure you a better ink cannot be desired for very important notes for which closer attention is required i pricked one of my fingers and wrote with my own blood â and when asked edmond_dantã_s may i see all this â whenever you please replied the abbã â_oh then let it be directly exclaimed the young man follow me then said the abbã as he re entered the subterranean passage in which he soon disappeared followed by edmond_dantã_s chapter 17 the abbã s chamber after having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage which however did not admit of their holding themselves erect the two friend reached the further end of the corridor into which the abbã s cell opened from that point the passage became much narrower and barely permitted one to creep through on hand and knees the floor of the abbã s cell was paved and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that abbã_faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which edmond_dantã_s had witnessed the completion as he entered the chamber of his friend edmond_dantã_s cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels but nothing more than common met his view â_it is well said the abbã we have some hour before usâ it is now just a quarter past twelve oâ clock instinctively edmond_dantã_s turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbã had been able so accurately to specify the hour
â look at this ray of light which enters by my window said the abbã and then observe the lines traced on the wall well by means of these lines which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth and the ellipse it describes round the sun i am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if i possessed a watch for that might be broken or deranged in its movements while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths this last explanation was wholly lost upon edmond_dantã_s who had always imagined from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the mediterranean that it moved and not the earth a double movement of the globe he inhabited and of which he could feel nothing appeared to him perfectly impossible each word that fell from his companionâ lip seemed fraught with the mysteries of science as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of guzerat and golconda which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth come said he to the abbã i am anxious to see your treasures the abbã smiled and proceeding to the disused fireplace raised by the help of his chisel a long stone which had doubtless been the hearth beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to edmond_dantã_s 0213 â what do you wish to see first asked the abbã â_oh your great work on the monarchy of italy abbã_faria then drew forth from his hiding place three or four rolls of linen laid one over the other like folds of papyrus
these rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing so legible that edmond_dantã_s could easily read it as well as make out the senseâ it being in italian a language he as a provenã al perfectly understood there said he there is the work complete i wrote the word finis at the end of the sixty eighth strip about a week ago i have torn up two of my shirts and as many handkerchiefs as i was master of to complete the precious pages should i ever get out of prison and find in all italy a printer courageous enough to publish what i have composed my literary reputation is forever secured â i see answered edmond_dantã_s now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your work â look said abbã_faria showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine painting brush to the end of which was tied by a piece of thread one of those cartilages of which the abbã had before spoken to edmond_dantã_s it was pointed and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen edmond_dantã_s examined it with intense admiration then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form ah yes said abbã_faria the penknife thatâ my masterpiece i made it as well as this larger knife out of an old iron candlestick the penknife was sharp and keen as a razor as for the other knife it would serve a double purpose and with it one could cut and thrust
dantã examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at marseilles as the works of the savages in the south seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels as for the ink said abbã_faria i told you how i managed to obtain thatâ and i only just make it from time to time as i require it â one thing still puzzles me observed edmond_dantã_s and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight â i worked at night also replied abbã_faria night why for heavenâ sake are your eye like catsâ that you can see to work in the dark â indeed they are not but god has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions i furnished myself with a light â you did pray tell me how â i separated the fat from the meat served to me melted it and so made oilâ here is my lamp so saying the abbã exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations but how do you procure a light â_oh here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen â and matches â i pretended that i had a disorder of the skin and asked for a little sulphur which was readily supplied edmond_dantã_s laid the different thing he had been looking at on the table and stood with his head drooping on his breast as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of fariaâ mind 0215 â you have not seen all yet continued abbã_faria for i did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding place let us shut this one up
they put the stone back in its place the abbã sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the other and then going towards his bed he removed it from the spot it stood in behind the head of the bed and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion was a hollow space and in this space a ladder of cords between twenty five and thirty foot in length edmond_dantã_s closely and eagerly examined it he found it firm solid and compact enough to bear any weight who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work â i tore up several of my shirts and ripped out the seams in the sheets of my bed during my three yearsâ imprisonment at fenestrelle and when i was removed to the chã teau dâ if i managed to bring the ravellings with me so that i have been able to finish my work here â and was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed â_oh no for when i had taken out the thread i required i hemmed the edges over again â with what â with this needle said the abbã as opening his ragged vestments he showed edmond_dantã_s a long sharp fish bone with a small perforated eye for the thread a small portion of which still remained in it
â i once thought continued abbã_faria of removing these iron bars and letting myself down from the window which as you see is somewhat wider than yours although i should have enlarged it still more preparatory to my flight however i discovered that i should merely have dropped into a sort of inner court and i therefore renounced the project altogether as too full of risk and danger nevertheless i carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which i spoke just now and which sudden chance frequently brings about while affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder the mind of edmond_dantã_s was in fact busily occupied by the idea that a person so intelligent ingenious and clear sighted as the abbã might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes where he himself could see nothing what are you thinking of asked the abbã smilingly imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder i was reflecting in the first place replied edmond_dantã_s upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained what would you not have accomplished if you had been free â possibly nothing at all the overflow of my brain would probably in a state of freedom have evaporated in a thousand follies misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect compression is needed to explode gunpowder captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus and you are well aware that from the collision of clouds electricity is producedâ from electricity lightning from lightning illumination â no replied edmond_dantã_s i know nothing some of your word are to me quite empty of meaning
you must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have the abbã smiled well said he but you had another subject for your thoughts did you not say so just now â i did â you have told me as yet but one of themâ let me hear the other â_it was this that while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life you were perfectly unacquainted with mine â your life my young friend has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important events â_it has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved misfortune i would fain fix the source of it on man that i may no longer vent reproaches upon heaven â then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged â i do indeed and this i swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earth my father and mercã_dã_s â come said the abbã closing his hiding place and pushing the bed back to its original situation let me hear your story edmond_dantã_s obeyed and commenced what he called his history but which consisted only of the account of a voyage to india and two or three voyages to the levant until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise with the death of captain leclere and the receipt of a packet to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal his interview with that personage and his receiving in place of the packet brought a letter addressed to a monsieur_albert noirtierâ his arrival at marseilles and interview with his fatherâ his affection for mercã_dã_s and their nuptual feastâ his arrest and subsequent examination his temporary detention at the palais de justice and his final imprisonment in the chã teau dâ if
from this point everything was a blank to dantã sâ he knew nothing more not even the length of time he had been imprisoned his recital finished the abbã reflected long and earnestly there is said he at the end of his meditations a clever maxim which bears upon what i was saying to you some little while ago and that is that unless wicked idea take root in a naturally depraved mind human nature in a right and wholesome state revolts at crime still from an artificial civilization have originated wants vices and false tastes which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle within us all good feelings and ultimately to lead us into guilt and wickedness from this view of thing then comes the axiom that if you visit to discover the author of any bad action seek first to discover the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any way advantageous now to apply it in your case to whom could your disappearance have been serviceable â to no one by heaven i was a very insignificant person â do not speak thus for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy everything is relative my dear young friend from the king who stands in the way of his successor to the employee who keeps his rival out of a place now in the event of the kingâ death his successor inherits a crown when the employee dies the supernumerary step into his shoes and receives his salary of twelve thousand livres well these twelve thousand livres are his civil list and are as essential to him as the twelve millions of a king
everyone from the highest to the lowest degree has his place on the social ladder and is beset by stormy passions and conflicting interests as in descartesâ theory of pressure and impulsion but these forces increase as we go higher so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon the apex and not on the base now let us return to your particular world you say you were on the point of being made captain of the pharaon â_yes â and about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl â_yes â now could anyone have had any interest in preventing the accomplishment of these two thing but let us first settle the question as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of the pharaon what say you â i cannot believe such was the case i was generally liked on board and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves i feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me there was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of ill will towards me i had quarelled with him some time previously and had even challenged him to fight me but he refused â now we are getting on and what was this manâ name â mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â what rank did he hold on board â he was supercargo â and had you been captain should you have retained him in his employment â not if the choice had remained with me for i had frequently observed inaccuracies in his accounts â good again
now then tell me was any person present during your last conversation with captain leclere â no we were quite alone â could your conversation have been overheard by anyone â_it might for the cabin door was openâ andâ stay now i recollect mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars himself passed by just as captain leclere was giving me the packet for the grand marshal â thatâ better cried the abbã now we are on the right scent did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of elba â nobody â somebody there received your packet and gave you a letter in place of it i think â_yes the grand marshal did â and what did you do with that letter â put it into my portfolio â you had your portfolio with you then now how could a sailor find room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official letter â you are right it was left on board â then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio â no â and what did you do with this same letter while returning from porto ferrajo to the vessel â i carried it in my hand â so that when you went on board the pharaon everybody could see that you held a letter in your hand â_yes â mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars as well as the rest â mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars as well as others â now listen to me and try to recall every circumstance attending your arrest do you recollect the word in which the information against you was formulated â oh
yes i read it over three time and the word sank deeply into my memory â repeat it to me edmond_dantã_s paused a moment then said this is it word for word the kingâ attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one edmond_dantã_s mate on board the pharaon this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been intrusted by murat with a packet for the usurper again by the usurper with a letter for the bonapartist club in paris this proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest as the letter will be found either about his person at his fatherâ residence or in his cabin on board the pharaon â the abbã shrugged his shoulders the thing is clear as day said he and you must have had a very confiding nature as well as a good heart not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair â do you really think so ah that would indeed be infamous â how did mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars usually write â in a handsome running hand â and how was the anonymous letter written â backhanded again the abbã smiled disguised â_it was very boldly written if disguised â stop a bit said the abbã taking up what he called his pen and after dipping it into the ink he wrote on a piece of prepared linen with his left hand the first two or three word of the accusation edmond_dantã_s drew back and gazed on the abbã with a sensation almost amounting to terror how very astonishing cried he at length why
your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation â simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand and i have noticed thatâ â what â that while the writing of different person done with the right hand varies that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform â you have evidently seen and observed everything â let us proceed â_oh yes yes â now as regards the second question â i am listening â was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with mercã_dã_s â_yes a young man who loved her â and his name wasâ â m_fernand_mondego â that is a spanish name i think â he was a catalan â you imagine him capable of writing the letter â_oh no he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me â that is in strict accordance with the spanish character an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit but an act of cowardice never â besides said edmond_dantã_s the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him â you had never spoken of them yourself to anyone â to no one â not even to your mistress â no not even to my betrothed â then it is mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â i feel quite sure of it now â wait a little pray was mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars acquainted with m_fernand_mondego â noâ yes he was now i recollectâ â what â to have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at pã re pamphileâ the evening before the day fixed for my wedding they were in earnest conversation mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was joking in a friendly way but m_fernand_mondego looked pale and agitated â were they alone â there was a third person with them whom i knew perfectly well and who had in all probability made their acquaintance he was a tailor named m_caderousse but he was very drunk stay stay how
strange that it should not have occurred to me before now i remember quite well that on the table round which they were sitting were pens ink and paper oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels exclaimed edmond_dantã_s pressing his hand to his throbbing brows is there anything else i can assist you in discovering besides the villany of your friend inquired the abbã with a laugh â_yes yes replied edmond_dantã_s eagerly i would beg of you who see so completely to the depths of thing and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy riddle to explain to me how it was that i underwent no second examination was never brought to trial and above all was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me â that is altogether a different and more serious matter responded the abbã the way of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily penetrated all we have hitherto done in the matter has been childâ play if you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of the business you must assist me by the most minute information on every point â pray ask me whatever questions you please for in good truth you see more clearly into my life than i do myself â in the first place then who examined you the kingâ attorney his deputy or a magistrate â the deputy â was he young or old â about six or seven and twenty year of age i should say â so answered the abbã old enough to be ambitious but too young to be corrupt and how did he treat you
â with more of mildness than severity â did you tell him your whole story â i did â and did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination â he did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this scrape he seemed quite overcome by my misfortune â by your misfortune â_yes â then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored â he gave me one great proof of his sympathy at any rate â and that â he burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me â what the accusation â no the letter â are you sure â i saw it done â that alters the case this man might after all be a greater scoundrel than you have thought possible â upon my word said edmond_dantã_s you make me shudder is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles â_yes and remember that two legged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the others â never mind let us go on â with all my heart you tell me he burned the letter â he did saying at the same time you see i thus destroy the only proof existing against you â this action is somewhat too sublime to be natural â you think so â i am sure of it to whom was this letter addressed â to m_noirtier_de_villefort rue coq hã ron no 13 paris â now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter â why it is not altogether impossible he might have had for he made me promise several time never to speak of that letter to anyone assuring me
he so advised me for my own interest and more than this he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address â m_noirtier_de_villefort repeated the abbã m_noirtier_de_villefort i knew a person of that name at the court of the queen of etruria a m_noirtier_de_villefort who had been a girondin during the revolution what was your deputy called â m_noirtier_de_villefort the abbã burst into a fit of laughter while edmond_dantã_s gazed on him in utter astonishment what ails you said he at length do you see that ray of sunlight â i do â well the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you poor fellow poor young man and you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you â he did â and the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter â_yes â and then made you swear never to utter the name of m_noirtier_de_villefort â_yes â why you poor short sighted simpleton can you not guess who this m_noirtier_de_villefort was whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed this m_noirtier_de_villefort was his father had a thunderbolt fallen at the foot of edmond_dantã_s or hell opened its yawning gulf before him he could not have been more completely transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected word starting up he clasped his hand around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting and exclaimed his father his father â_yes his father replied the abbã his right name was m_noirtier_de_villefort at this instant a bright light shot through the mind of edmond_dantã_s and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before
the change that had come over m_noirtier_de_villefort during the examination the destruction of the letter the exacted promise the almost supplicating tone of the magistrate who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishment all returned with a stunning force to his memory he cried out and staggered against the wall like a drunken man then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbã s cell to his own and said i must be alone to think over all this when he regained his dungeon he threw himself on his bed where the turnkey found him in the evening visit sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features dumb and motionless as a statue during these hour of profound meditation which to him had seemed only minute he had formed a fearful resolution and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath edmond_dantã_s was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of abbã_faria who having also been visited by his jailer had come to invite his fellow sufferer to share his supper the reputation of being out of his mind though harmlessly and even amusingly so had procured for the abbã unusual privileges he was supplied with bread of a finer whiter quality than the usual prison fare and even regaled each sunday with a small quantity of wine now this was a sunday and the abbã had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him edmond_dantã_s followed him his features were no longer contracted and now wore their usual expression but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve abbã_faria bent on him his penetrating eye i regret now
said he having helped you in your late inquiries or having given you the information i did â why so inquired edmond_dantã_s because it has instilled a new passion in your heartâ that of vengeance edmond_dantã_s smiled let us talk of something else said he again the abbã looked at him then mournfully shook his head but in accordance with dantã sâ request he began to speak of other matters the elder prisoner was one of those person whose conversation like that of all who have experienced many trials contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information but it was never egotistical for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows edmond_dantã_s listened with admiring attention to all he said some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire a part of the good abbã s word however were wholly incomprehensible to him but like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as abbã_faria along the heights of truth where he was so much at home you must teach me a small part of what you know said edmond_dantã_s if only to prevent your growing weary of me i can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself if you will only agree to my request i promise you never to mention another word about escaping the abbã smiled
â alas my boy said he human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits and when i have taught you mathematics physics history and the three or four modern languages with which i am acquainted you will know as much as i do myself now it will scarcely require two year for me to communicate to you the stock of learning i possess â two year exclaimed edmond_dantã_s do you really believe i can acquire all these thing in so short a time â not their application certainly but their principles you may to learn is not to know there are the learners and the learned memory makes the one philosophy the other â but cannot one learn philosophy â philosophy cannot be taught it is the application of the sciences to truth it is like the golden cloud in which the messiah went up into heaven â well then said edmond_dantã_s what shall you teach me first i am in a hurry to begin i want to learn â everything said the abbã and that very evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education to be entered upon the following day edmond_dantã_s possessed a prodigious memory combined with an astonishing quickness and readiness of conception the mathematical turn of his mind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation while his naturally poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of arithmetical computation or the rigid severity of geometry he already knew italian and had also picked up a little of the romaic dialect during voyages to the east and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others so that at the end of six month he began to speak spanish english and german
in strict accordance with the promise made to the abbã edmond_dantã_s spoke no more of escape perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word on which his sense of honor was keen kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of flight day even month passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive course at the end of a year edmond_dantã_s was a new man edmond_dantã_s observed however that abbã_faria in spite of the relief his society afforded daily grew sadder one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his mind sometimes he would fall into long reveries sigh heavily and involuntarily then suddenly rise and with folded arm begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon one day he stopped all at once and exclaimed ah if there were no sentinel â there shall not be one a minute longer than you please said edmond_dantã_s who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations i have already told you answered the abbã that i loathe the idea of shedding blood â and yet the murder if you choose to call it so would be simply a measure of self preservation â no matter i could never agree to it â still you have thought of it â incessantly alas cried the abbã and you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom have you not asked edmond_dantã_s eagerly i have if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us â he shall be both blind and deaf replied the young man with an air of determination that made his companion shudder
â no no cried the abbã impossible edmond_dantã_s endeavored to renew the subject the abbã shook his head in token of disapproval and refused to make any further response three month passed away are you strong the abbã asked one day of edmond_dantã_s the young man in reply took up the chisel bent it into the form of a horseshoe and then as readily straightened it and will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry except as a last resort â i promise on my honor â then said the abbã we may hope to put our design into execution â and how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work â at least a year â and shall we begin at once â at once â we have lost a year to no purpose cried edmond_dantã_s do you consider the last twelve month to have been wasted asked the abbã forgive me cried edmond_dantã_s blushing deeply tut tut answered the abbã man is but man after all and you are about the best specimen of the genus i have ever known come let me show you my plan the abbã then showed edmond_dantã_s the sketch he had made for their escape it consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of edmond_dantã_s with the passage which united them
in this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch once there a large excavation would be made and one of the flag stones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the foot of the soldier who stunned by his fall would be immediately bound and gagged by edmond_dantã_s before he had power to offer any resistance the prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery window and to let themselves down from the outer wall by means of the abbã s ladder of cords dantã sâ eye sparkled with joy and he rubbed his hand with delight at the idea of a plan so simple yet apparently so certain to succeed that very day the miners began their labors with a vigor and alacrity proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of ultimate success nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkeyâ visits they had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons and happily never failed of being prepared for his coming the fresh earth excavated during their present work and which would have entirely blocked up the old passage was thrown by degrees and with the utmost precaution out of the window in either fariaâ or dantã sâ cell the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain
more than a year had been consumed in this undertaking the only tools for which had been a chisel a knife and a wooden lever abbã_faria still continuing to instruct edmond_dantã_s by conversing with him sometimes in one language sometimes in another at others relating to him the history of nations and great man who from time to time have risen to fame and trodden the path of glory the abbã was a man of the world and had moreover mixed in the first society of the day he wore an air of melancholy dignity which edmond_dantã_s thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature easily acquired as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting in and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with person of high birth and breeding at the end of fifteen month the level was finished and the excavation completed beneath the gallery and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their head compelled as they were to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their flight they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that auspicious moment should arrive their greatest dread now was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before its right time and this they had in some measure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the wall through which they had worked their way
dantã was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard abbã_faria who had remained in edmondâ cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their rope ladder call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering edmond_dantã_s hastened to his dungeon where he found him standing in the middle of the room pale as death his forehead streaming with perspiration and his hand clenched tightly together gracious heavens exclaimed edmond_dantã_s what is the matter what has happened â quick quick returned the abbã listen to what i have to say edmond_dantã_s looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of abbã_faria whose eye already dull and sunken were surrounded by purple circles while his lip were white as those of a corpse and his very hair seemed to stand on end tell me i beseech you what ails you cried edmond_dantã_s letting his chisel fall to the floor alas faltered out the abbã all is over with me i am seized with a terrible perhaps mortal illness i can feel that the paroxysm is fast approaching i had a similar attack the year previous to my imprisonment this malady admits but of one remedy i will tell you what that is go into my cell as quickly as you can draw out one of the foot that support the bed you will find it has been hollowed out for the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there half filled with a red looking fluid bring it to meâ or ratherâ no no i may be found here therefore help me back to my room while i have the strength to drag myself along
who knows what may happen or how long the attack may last in spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes edmond_dantã_s did not lose his presence of mind but descended into the passage dragging his unfortunate companion with him then half carrying half supporting him he managed to reach the abbã s chamber when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed thanks said the poor abbã shivering as though his veins were filled with ice i am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy when it comes to its height i shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead uttering neither sigh nor groan on the other hand the symptoms may be much more violent and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions foam at the mouth and cry out loudly take care my cries are not heard for if they are it is more than probable i should be removed to another part of the prison and we be separated forever when i become quite motionless cold and rigid as a corpse then and not before be careful about this force open my teeth with the knife pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat and i may perhaps revive â perhaps exclaimed edmond_dantã_s in grief stricken tone help help cried the abbã iâ iâ dieâ iâ â 0229m so sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was unable to complete the sentence a violent convulsion shook his whole frame his eye started from their sockets his mouth was drawn on one side his cheeks became purple he struggled foamed dashed himself about and uttered the most dreadful cries which however edmond_dantã_s prevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket
the fit lasted two hour then more helpless than an infant and colder and paler than marble more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot he fell back doubled up in one last convulsion and became as rigid as a corpse edmond_dantã_s waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend then taking up the knife he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws carefully administered the appointed number of drops and anxiously awaited the result an hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning animation edmond_dantã_s began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy and thrusting his hand into his hair continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend at length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks consciousness returned to the dull open eyeballs a faint sigh issued from the lip and the sufferer made a feeble effort to move he is saved he is saved cried edmond_dantã_s in a paroxysm of delight the sick man was not yet able to speak but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the door edmond_dantã_s listened and plainly distinguished the approaching step of the jailer it was therefore near seven oâ clock but edmondâ anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head the young man sprang to the entrance darted through it carefully drawing the stone over the opening and hurried to his cell he had scarcely done so before the door opened and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed
almost before the key had turned in the lock and before the departing step of the jailer had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse edmond_dantã_s whose restless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him hurried back to the abbã s chamber and raising the stone by pressing his head against it was soon beside the sick manâ couch abbã_faria had now fully regained his consciousness but he still lay helpless and exhausted on his miserable bed i did not expect to see you again said he feebly to edmond_dantã_s and why not asked the young man did you fancy yourself dying â no i had no such idea but knowing that all was ready for flight i thought you might have made your escape the deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of edmond_dantã_s without you did you really think me capable of that â at least said the abbã i now see how wrong such an opinion would have been alas alas i am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this attack â be of good cheer replied edmond_dantã_s your strength will return and as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside abbã_faria and took his hand the abbã shook his head the last attack i had said he lasted but half an hour and after it i was hungry and got up without help now i can move neither my right arm nor leg and my head seems uncomfortable which shows that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain the third attack will either carry me off or leave me paralyzed for life â no no cried edmond_dantã_s you are mistakenâ you will not die
and your third attack if indeed you should have another will find you at liberty we shall save you another time as we have done this only with a better chance of success because we shall be able to command every requisite assistance â my good edmond_dantã_s answered the abbã be not deceived the attack which has just passed away condemns me forever to the wall of a prison none can fly from a dungeon who cannot walk â well we will wait a week a month two month if need be and meanwhile your strength will return everything is in readiness for our flight and we can select any time we choose as soon as you feel able to swim we will go â i shall never swim again replied abbã_faria this arm is paralyzed not for a time but forever lift it and judge if i am mistaken the young man raised the arm which fell back by its own weight perfectly inanimate and helpless a sigh escaped him you are convinced now edmond_dantã_s are you not asked the abbã depend upon it i know what i say since the first attack i experienced of this malady i have continually reflected on it indeed i expected it for it is a family inheritance both my father and grandfather died of it in a third attack the physician who prepared for me the remedy i have twice successfully taken was no other than the celebrated cabanis and he predicted a similar end for me 0233m the physician may be mistaken exclaimed edmond_dantã_s and as for your poor arm what difference will that make
i can take you on my shoulders and swim for both of us â my son said the abbã you who are a sailor and a swimmer must know as well as i do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty strokes cease then to allow yourself to be duped by vain hopes that even your own excellent heart refuses to believe in here i shall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives and that in all human probability will be the hour of my death as for you who are young and active delay not on my account but flyâ goâ i give you back your promise â_it is well said edmond_dantã_s then i shall also remain then rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old manâ head he slowly added by the blood of christ i swear never to leave you while you live abbã_faria gazed fondly on his noble minded single hearted high principled young friend and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose thanks murmured the invalid extending one hand i accept you may one of these day reap the reward of your disinterested devotion but as i cannot and you will not quit this place it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldierâ gallery he might by chance hear the hollow sound of his footsteps and call the attention of his officer to the circumstance that would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated go then and set about this work in which unhappily i can offer you no assistance keep at it all night if necessary and do not return here tomorrow till after the jailer has visited me
i shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you edmond_dantã_s took the hand of the abbã in his and affectionately pressed it abbã_faria smiled encouragingly on him and the young man retired to his task in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show towards his aged friend chapter 18 the treasure when edmond_dantã_s returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity he found abbã_faria seated and looking composed in the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell he held open in his left hand of which alone it will be recollected he retained the use a sheet of paper which from being constantly rolled into a small compass had the form of a cylinder and was not easily kept open he did not speak but showed the paper to edmond_dantã_s what is that he inquired look at it said the abbã with a smile i have looked at it with all possible attention said edmond_dantã_s and i only see a half burnt paper on which are traces of gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink â this paper my friend said abbã_faria i may now avow to you since i have the proof of your fidelityâ this paper is my treasure of which from this day forth one half belongs to you the sweat started forth on dantã sâ brow until this day and for how long a time he had refrained from talking of the treasure which had brought upon the abbã the accusation of madness with his instinctive delicacy edmond_dantã_s had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord and abbã_faria had been equally silent
he had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason and now these few word uttered by abbã_faria after so painful a crisis seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation your treasure stammered edmond_dantã_s abbã_faria smiled â_yes said he you have indeed a noble nature edmond_dantã_s and i see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this moment no be assured i am not mad this treasure exists edmond_dantã_s and if i have not been allowed to possess it you will yesâ you no one would listen or believe me because everyone thought me mad but you who must know that i am not listen to me and believe me so afterwards if you will â alas murmured edmond_dantã_s to himself this is a terrible relapse there was only this blow wanting then he said aloud my dear friend your attack has perhaps fatigued you had you not better repose awhile tomorrow if you will i will hear your narrative but today i wish to nurse you carefully besides he said a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about â on the contrary it is a matter of the utmost importance edmond_dantã_s replied the old man who knows if tomorrow or the next day after the third attack may not come on and then must not all be over yes indeed i have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches which would make the wealth of a dozen families will be forever lost to those man who persecute me this idea was one of vengeance to me and i tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity
but now i have forgiven the world for the love of you now that i see you young and with a promising future now that i think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure i shudder at any delay and tremble lest i should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth edmond_dantã_s turned away his head with a sigh you persist in your incredulity edmond_dantã_s continued abbã_faria my word have not convinced you i see you require proofs well then read this paper which i have never shown to anyone â tomorrow my dear friend said edmond_dantã_s desirous of not yielding to the old manâ madness i thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow â then we will not talk of it until tomorrow but read this paper today â i will not irritate him thought edmond_dantã_s and taking the paper of which half was wanting having been burnt no doubt by some accident he read this treasure which may amount to two of roman crowns in the most distant a of the second opening wh declare to belong to him alo heir 25th april 149â â well said abbã_faria when the young man had finished reading it why replied edmond_dantã_s i see nothing but broken lines and unconnected word which are rendered illegible by fire â_yes to you my friend who read them for the first time but not for me who have grown pale over them by many nightsâ study and have reconstructed every phrase completed every thought â and
do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning â i am sure i have and you shall judge for yourself but first listen to the history of this paper â silence exclaimed edmond_dantã_s step approachâ i goâ adieu and edmond_dantã_s happy to escape the history and explanation which would be sure to confirm his belief in his friendâ mental instability glided like a snake along the narrow passage while abbã_faria restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity pushed the stone into place with his foot and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to avoid discovery it was the governor who hearing of fariaâ illness from the jailer had come in person to see him abbã_faria sat up to receive him avoiding all gestures in order that he might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half stricken him with death his fear was lest the governor touched with pity might order him to be removed to better quarters and thus separate him from his young companion but fortunately this was not the case and the governor left him convinced that the poor madman for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection was only troubled with a slight indisposition during this time edmond_dantã_s seated on his bed with his head in his hand tried to collect his scattered thoughts abbã_faria since their first acquaintance had been on all points so rational and logical so wonderfully sagacious in fact that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with madness was abbã_faria deceived as to his treasure or was all the world deceived as to abbã_faria
dantã remained in his cell all day not daring to return to his friend thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced once for all that the abbã was madâ such a conviction would be so terrible but towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone by abbã_faria not seeing the young man appear tried to move and get over the distance which separated them edmond_dantã_s shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along his leg was inert and he could no longer make use of one arm edmond_dantã_s was obliged to assist him for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to dantã sâ chamber here i am pursuing you remorselessly he said with a benignant smile you thought to escape my munificence but it is in vain listen to me edmond_dantã_s saw there was no escape and placing the old man on his bed he seated himself on the stool beside him you know said the abbã that i was the secretary and intimate friend of cardinal_spada the last of the princes of that name i owe to this worthy lord all the happiness i ever knew he was not rich although the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb and i heard the phrase very often as rich as a cardinal_spada but he like public rumor lived on this reputation for wealth his palace was my paradise i was tutor to his nephews who are dead and when he was alone in the world i tried by absolute devotion to his will to make up to him all he had done for me during ten year of unremitting kindness
the cardinalâ house_of_peers had no secrets for me i had often seen my noble patron annotating ancient volumes and eagerly searching amongst dusty family manuscripts one day when i was reproaching him for his unavailing searches and deploring the prostration of mind that followed them he looked at me and smiling bitterly opened a volume relating to the history of the city of rome there in the twentieth chapter of the life of pope alexander_vi were the following lines which i can never forget â the great wars of romagna had ended cã_sar_borgia who had completed his conquest had need of money to purchase all italy the pope had also need of money to bring matters to an end with louis_xviii xii king of france who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses and it was necessary therefore to have recourse to some profitable scheme which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of exhausted italy his holiness had an idea he determined to make two cardinals â by choosing two of the greatest personages of rome especially rich menâ this was the return the holy father looked for in the first place he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held and then he had the two hats to sell besides there was a third point in view which will appear hereafter the pope and cã_sar_borgia first found the two future cardinals they were giovanni rospigliosi who held four of the highest dignities of the holy see and cã_sar_borgia cardinal_spada one of the noblest and richest of the roman nobility both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope they were ambitious and cã_sar_borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments
the result was that rospigliosi and cardinal_spada paid for being cardinals and eight other person paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the speculators 0239 â_it is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation the pope heaped attentions upon rospigliosi and cardinal_spada conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at rome then the pope and cã_sar_borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner this was a matter of dispute between the holy father and his son cã_sar_borgia thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friend that is to say in the first place the famous key which was given to certain person with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard this key was furnished with a small iron point a negligence on the part of the locksmith when this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard of which the lock was difficult the person was pricked by this small point and died next day then there was the ring with the lionâ head which cã_sar_borgia wore when he wanted to greet his friend with a clasp of the hand the lion bit the hand thus favored and at the end of twenty four hour the bite was mortal cã_sar_borgia proposed to his father that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard or shake hand with them but alexander_vi replied now as to the worthy cardinals cardinal_spada and rospigliosi let us ask both of them to dinner something tells me that we shall get that money back
besides you forget cã_sar_borgia an indigestion declares itself immediately while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two cã_sar_borgia gave way before such cogent reasoning and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner the table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope near san pierdarena a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report rospigliosi quite set up with his new dignities went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner cardinal_spada a prudent man and greatly attached to his only nephew a young captain of the highest promise took paper and pen and made his will he then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard but it appeared the servant did not find him cardinal_spada knew what these invitations meant since christianity so eminently civilizing had made progress in rome it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message cã_sar_borgia wills that you die but it was a legate latere who came with a smile on his lip to say from the pope his holiness requests you to dine with him â cardinal_spada set out about two oâ clock to san pierdarena the pope awaited him the first sight that attracted the eye of cardinal_spada was that of his nephew in full costume and cã_sar_borgia paying him most marked attentions cardinal_spada turned pale as cã_sar_borgia looked at him with an ironical air which proved that he had anticipated all and that the snare was well spread they began dinner and cardinal_spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message the nephew replied no perfectly comprehending the meaning of the question
it was too late for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine placed for him expressly by the popeâ butler cardinal_spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him which he was pressed to taste an hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms cardinal_spada died on the threshold of the vineyard the nephew expired at his own door making signs which his wife could not comprehend then cã_sar_borgia and the pope hastened to lay hand on the heritage under pretense of seeking for the paper of the dead man but the inheritance consisted in this only a scrap of paper on which cardinal_spada had written â i bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers my books and amongst others my breviary with the gold corners which i beg he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle â the heirs sought everywhere admired the breviary laid hand on the furniture and were greatly astonished that cardinal_spada the rich man was really the most miserable of unclesâ no treasuresâ unless they were those of science contained in the library and laboratories that was all cã_sar_borgia and his father searched examined scrutinized but found nothing or at least very little not exceeding a few thousand crowns in plate and about the same in ready money but the nephew had time to say to his wife before he expired look well among my uncleâ paper there is a will â they sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done but it was fruitless there were two palaces and a vineyard behind the palatine hill but in these day landed property had not much value and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his son
months and year rolled on alexander_vi died poisoned you know by what mistake cã_sar_borgia poisoned at the same time escaped by shedding his skin like a snake but the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a tigerâ then compelled to quit rome he went and got himself obscurely killed in a night skirmish scarcely noticed in history after the popeâ death and his sonâ exile it was supposed that the cardinal_spada family would resume the splendid position they had held before the cardinalâ time but this was not the case the spadas remained in doubtful ease a mystery hung over this dark affair and the public rumor was that cã_sar_borgia a better politician than his father had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals i say the two because cardinal rospigliosi who had not taken any precaution was completely despoiled up to this point said abbã_faria interrupting the thread of his narrative this seems to you very meaningless no doubt eh â_oh my friend cried edmond_dantã_s on the contrary it seems as if i were reading a most interesting narrative go on i beg of you â i will the family began to get accustomed to their obscurity year rolled on and amongst the descendants some were soldiers others diplomatists some churchmen some bankers some grew rich and some were ruined i come now to the last of the family whose secretary i wasâ the count of cardinal_spada i had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank with his fortune and i advised him to invest all he had in an annuity he did so and thus doubled his income the celebrated breviary remained in the family and was in the countâ possession
it had been handed down from father to son for the singular clause of the only will that had been found had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic preserved in the family with superstitious veneration it was an illuminated book with beautiful gothic characters and so weighty with gold that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on day of great solemnity at the sight of paper of all sorts titles contracts parchments which were kept in the archives of the family all descending from the poisoned cardinal i in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents like twenty servitors stewards secretaries before me but in spite of the most exhaustive researches i foundâ nothing yet i had read i had even written a precise history of the cã_sar_borgia family for the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the cardinal cã_sar_borgia cardinal_spada but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the cardinal rospigliosi his companion in misfortune i was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the borgias nor the family but had remained unpossessed like the treasures of the arabian night which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eye of the genie i searched ransacked counted calculated a thousand and a thousand time the income and expenditure of the family for three hundred year it was useless i remained in my ignorance and the count of cardinal_spada in his poverty my patron died he had reserved from his annuity his family paper his library composed of five thousand volumes and his famous breviary all these he bequeathed to me with a thousand roman crowns which he had in ready money
on condition that i would have anniversary masses said for the repose of his soul and that i would draw up a genealogical tree and history of his house_of_peers all this i did scrupulously be easy my dear edmond_dantã_s we are near the conclusion in 1807 a month before i was arrested and a fortnight after the death of the count of cardinal_spada on the 25th of december you will see presently how the date became fixed in my memory i was reading for the thousandth time the paper i was arranging for the palace was sold to a stranger and i was going to leave rome and settle at florence intending to take with me twelve thousand franc i possessed my library and the famous breviary when tired with my constant labor at the same thing and overcome by a heavy dinner i had eaten my head dropped on my hand and i fell asleep about three oâ clock in the afternoon 0243m i awoke as the clock was striking six i raised my head i was in utter darkness i rang for a light but as no one came i determined to find one for myself it was indeed but anticipating the simple manner which i should soon be under the necessity of adopting i took a wax candle in one hand and with the other groped about for a piece of paper my match box being empty with which i proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the embers
fearing however to make use of any valuable piece of paper i hesitated for a moment then recollected that i had seen in the famous breviary which was on the table beside me an old paper quite yellow with age and which had served as a marker for centuries kept there by the request of the heirs i felt for it found it twisted it up together and putting it into the expiring flame set light to it but beneath my fingers as if by magic in proportion as the fire ascended i saw yellowish characters appear on the paper i grasped it in my hand put out the flame as quickly as i could lighted my taper in the fire itself and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion recognizing when i had done so that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink only appearing when exposed to the fire nearly one third of the paper had been consumed by the flame it was that paper you read this morning read it again edmond_dantã_s and then i will complete for you the incomplete word and unconnected sense abbã_faria with an air of triumph offered the paper to edmond_dantã_s who this time read the following word traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust this 25th day of april 1498 be alexander_vi and fearing that not he may desire to become my heir and re and bentivoglio who were poisoned my sole heir that i have bu and has visited with me that is in island of count_of_monte_cristo all i poss jewels diamonds gems that i alone may amount to nearly two mil will find on raising the twentieth ro creek to the east in a right line
two open in these caves the treasure is in the furthest a which treasure i bequeath and leave en as my sole heir 25th april 1498 cã â and now said the abbã read this other paper and he presented to edmond_dantã_s a second leaf with fragments of lines written on it which edmond_dantã_s read as follows ing invited to dine by his holiness content with making me pay for my hat serves for me the fate of cardinals caprara i declare to my nephew guido cardinal_spada ried in a place he knows the caves of the small essed of ingots gold money know of the existence of this treasure which lions of roman crowns and which he ck from the small ings have been made ngle in the second tire to him ar cardinal_spada abbã_faria followed him with an excited look and now he said when he saw that edmond_dantã_s had read the last line put the two fragments together and judge for yourself edmond_dantã_s obeyed and the conjointed pieces gave the following 0245 â this 25th day of april 1498 be ing invited to dine by his holiness alexander_vi and fearing that not content with making me pay for my hat he may desire to become my heir and re serves for me the fate of cardinals caprara and bentivoglio who were poisoned

aided by the remaining fragment i guessed the rest measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above us â and what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion â i resolved to set out and did set out at that very instant carrying with me the beginning of my great work the unity of the italian kingdom but for some time the imperial police who at this period quite contrary to what napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to him wished for a partition of provinces had their eye on me and my hasty departure the cause of which they were unable to guess having aroused their suspicions i was arrested at the very moment i was leaving piombino now continued abbã_faria addressing edmond_dantã_s with an almost paternal expression now my dear fellow you know as much as i do myself if we ever escape together half this treasure is yours if i die here and you escape alone the whole belongs to you â but inquired edmond_dantã_s hesitating has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves â no no be easy on that score the family is extinct the last count of cardinal_spada moreover made me his heir bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary he bequeathed to me all it contained no no make your mind satisfied on that point if we lay hand on this fortune we may enjoy it without remorse â and you say this treasure amounts toâ â two millions of roman crowns nearly thirteen millions of our money 2 impossible said edmond_dantã_s staggered at the enormous amount impossible
and why asked the old man the cardinal_spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century and in those time when other opportunities for investment were wanting such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare there are at this day roman families perishing of hunger though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels handed down by entail and which they cannot touch edmond_dantã_s thought he was in a dreamâ he wavered between incredulity and joy i have only kept this secret so long from you continued abbã_faria that i might test your character and then surprise you had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy i should have conducted you to count_of_monte_cristo now he added with a sigh â_it is you who will conduct me thither well edmond_dantã_s you do not thank me â this treasure belongs to you my dear friend replied edmond_dantã_s and to you only i have no right to it i am no relation of yours â you are my son edmond_dantã_s exclaimed the old man you are the child of my captivity my profession condemns me to celibacy god has sent you to me to console at one and the same time the man who could not be a father and the prisoner who could not get free and abbã_faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man who threw himself upon his neck and wept chapter 19
the third attack now that this treasure which had so long been the object of the abbã s meditations could insure the future happiness of him whom abbã_faria really loved as a son it had doubled its value in his eye and every day he expatiated on the amount explaining to edmond_dantã_s all the good which with thirteen or fourteen millions of franc a man could do in these day to his friend and then dantã sâ countenance became gloomy for the oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory and he reflected how much ill in these time a man with thirteen or fourteen millions could do to his enemies the abbã did not know the island of count_of_monte_cristo but edmond_dantã_s knew it and had often passed it situated twenty five miles from pianosa between corsica and the island of elba and had once touched there this island was always had been and still is completely deserted it is a rock of almost conical form which look as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean edmond_dantã_s drew a plan of the island for abbã_faria and abbã_faria gave edmond_dantã_s advice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure but edmond_dantã_s was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man
it was past a question now that abbã_faria was not a lunatic and the way in which he had achieved the discovery which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness increased edmondâ admiration of him but at the same time edmond_dantã_s could not believe that the deposit supposing it had ever existed still existed and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical he yet believed it was no longer there however as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment a new misfortune befell them the gallery on the sea side which had long been in ruins was rebuilt they had repaired it completely and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole edmond_dantã_s had partly filled in but for this precaution which it will be remembered the abbã had made to edmond_dantã_s the misfortune would have been still greater for their attempt to escape would have been detected and they would undoubtedly have been separated thus a new a stronger and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their hopes you see said the young man with an air of sorrowful resignation to abbã_faria that god deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you i have promised to remain forever with you and now i could not break my promise if i would the treasure will be no more mine than yours and neither of us will quit this prison
but my real treasure is not that my dear friend which awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of count_of_monte_cristo it is your presence our living together five or six hour a day in spite of our jailers it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain the languages you have implanted in my memory and which have taken root there with all their philological ramifications these different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced themâ this is my treasure my beloved friend and with this you have made me rich and happy believe me and take comfort this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea which we take for terra firma and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them to have you as long as possible near me to hear your eloquent speech which embellishes my mind strengthens my soul and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible thing if i should ever be free so fills my whole existence that the despair to which i was just on the point of yielding when i knew you has no longer any hold over me and thisâ this is my fortuneâ not chimerical but actual i owe you my real good my present happiness and all the sovereigns of the earth even cã_sar_borgia himself could not deprive me of this thus if not actually happy yet the day these two unfortunates passed together went quickly
faria who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure now perpetually talked of it as he had prophesied would be the case he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself but he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy for fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen he compelled edmond_dantã_s to learn it by heart and edmond_dantã_s knew it from the first to the last word then he destroyed the second portion assured that if the first were seized no one would be able to discover its real meaning whole hour sometimes passed while abbã_faria was giving instructions to edmond_dantã_s instructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty then once free from the day and hour and moment when he was so he could have but one only thought which was to gain count_of_monte_cristo by some means and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions and once there to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns and search in the appointed spot the appointed spot be it remembered being the farthest angle in the second opening in the meanwhile the hour passed if not rapidly at least tolerably abbã_faria as we have said without having recovered the use of his hand and foot had regained all the clearness of his understanding and had gradually besides the moral instructions we have detailed taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner who learns to make something from nothing
they were thus perpetually employed abbã_faria that he might not see himself grow old edmond_dantã_s for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the night so life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of providence but beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man and perhaps in that of the old man many repressed desires many stifled sighs which found vent when abbã_faria was left alone and when edmond_dantã_s returned to his cell one night edmond_dantã_s awoke suddenly believing that he heard someone calling him he opened his eye upon utter darkness his name or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name reached him he sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow undoubtedly the call came from fariaâ dungeon alas murmured edmond_dantã_s can it be he moved his bed drew up the stone rushed into the passage and reached the opposite extremity the secret entrance was open by the light of the wretched and wavering lamp of which we have spoken edmond_dantã_s saw the old man pale but yet erect clinging to the bedstead his features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time alas my dear friend said abbã_faria in a resigned tone you understand do you not and i need not attempt to explain to you edmond_dantã_s uttered a cry of agony and quite out of his senses rushed towards the door exclaiming help help abbã_faria had just sufficient strength to restrain him
â silence he said or you are lost we must now only think of you my dear friend and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight possible it would require year to do again what i have done here and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew we had communicated with each other besides be assured my dear edmond_dantã_s the dungeon i am about to leave will not long remain empty some other unfortunate being will soon take my place and to him you will appear like an angel of salvation perhaps he will be young strong and enduring like yourself and will aid you in your escape while i have been but a hindrance you will no longer have half a dead body tied to you as a drag to all your movements at length providence has done something for you he restores to you more than he takes away and it was time i should die edmond_dantã_s could only clasp his hand and exclaim â_oh my friend my friend speak not thus and then resuming all his presence of mind which had for a moment staggered under this blow and his strength which had failed at the word of the old man he said â_oh i have saved you once and i will save you a second time and raising the foot of the bed he drew out the phial still a third filled with the red liquor see he exclaimed there remains still some of the magic draught quick quick tell me what i must do this time are there any fresh instructions
speak my friend i listen â there is not a hope replied abbã_faria shaking his head but no matter god wills it that man whom he has created and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life should do all in his power to preserve that existence which however painful it may be is yet always so dear â_oh yes yes exclaimed edmond_dantã_s and i tell you that i will save you yet â well then try the cold gains upon me i feel the blood flowing towards my brain these horrible chills which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones begin to pervade my whole frame in five minute the malady will reach its height and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse â_oh exclaimed edmond_dantã_s his heart wrung with anguish do as you did before only do not wait so long all the springs of life are now exhausted in me and death he continued looking at his paralyzed arm and leg has but half its work to do if after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten you see that i do not recover then pour the rest down my throat now lift me on my bed for i can no longer support myself edmond_dantã_s took the old man in his arm and laid him on the bed and now my dear friend said abbã_faria sole consolation of my wretched existence you whom heaven gave me somewhat late but still gave me a priceless gift and for which i am most grateful at the moment of separating from you forever i wish you all the happiness and all the prosperity you so well deserve
my son i bless thee the young man cast himself on his knees leaning his head against the old manâ bed listen now to what i say in this my dying moment the treasure of the spadas exists god grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or space i see it in the depths of the inner cavern my eye pierce the inmost recesses of the earth and are dazzled at the sight of so much riches if you do escape remember that the poor abbã whom all the world called mad was not so hasten to monte cristoâ avail yourself of the fortuneâ for you have indeed suffered long enough a violent convulsion attacked the old man edmond_dantã_s raised his head and saw fariaâ eye injected with blood it seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head adieu adieu murmured the old man clasping edmondâ hand convulsivelyâ adieu â_oh no no not yet he cried do not forsake me oh succor him helpâ helpâ help â hush hush murmured the dying man that they may not separate us if you save me â you are right oh yes yes be assured i shall save you besides although you suffer much you do not seem to be in such agony as you were before â do not mistake i suffer less because there is in me less strength to endure at your age we have faith in life it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope but old man see death more clearly oh tis hereâ tis hereâ tis overâ my sight is goneâ my senses fail your hand edmond_dantã_s adieu adieu and raising himself by a final effort in which he summoned all his faculties he said â count_of_monte_cristo forget not count_of_monte_cristo and he fell back on the bed
the crisis was terrible and a rigid form with twisted limbs swollen eyelids and lip flecked with bloody foam lay on the bed of torture in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested there edmond_dantã_s took the lamp placed it on a projecting stone above the bed whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless stiffened body with steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative when he believed that the right moment had arrived he took the knife pried open the teeth which offered less resistance than before counted one after the other twelve drops and watched the phial contained perhaps twice as much more he waited ten minute a quarter of an hour half an hour no change took place trembling his hair erect his brow bathed with perspiration he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart then he thought it was time to make the last trial and he put the phial to the purple lip of abbã_faria and without having occasion to force open his jaws which had remained extended he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat 0255 the draught produced a galvanic effect a violent trembling pervaded the old manâ limbs his eye opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek and then his convulsed body returned gradually to its former immobility the eye remaining open
half an hour an hour an hour and a half elapsed and during this period of anguish edmond_dantã_s leaned over his friend his hand applied to his heart and felt the body gradually grow cold and the heartâ pulsation become more and more deep and dull until at length it stopped the last movement of the heart ceased the face became livid the eye remained open but the eyeballs were glazed it was six oâ clock in the morning the dawn was just breaking and its feeble ray came into the dungeon and paled the ineffectual light of the lamp strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man and at time gave it the appearance of life while the struggle between day and night lasted edmond_dantã_s still doubted but as soon as the daylight gained the pre eminence he saw that he was alone with a corpse then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eye which he tried many time to close but in vainâ they opened again as soon as shut he extinguished the lamp carefully concealed it and then went away closing as well as he could the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended it was time for the jailer was coming on this occasion he began his rounds at dantã sâ cell and on leaving him he went on to fariaâ dungeon taking thither breakfast and some linen nothing betokened that the man knew anything of what had occurred he went on his way edmond_dantã_s was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was going on in the dungeon of his unfortunate friend
he therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the turnkey who called out for help other turnkeys came and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers last of all came the governor edmond_dantã_s heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse heard the voice of the governor who asked them to throw water on the dead manâ face and seeing that in spite of this application the prisoner did not recover they sent for the doctor the governor then went out and word of pity fell on dantã sâ listening ears mingled with brutal laughter well well said one the madman has gone to look after his treasure good journey to him â with all his millions he will not have enough to pay for his shroud said another â_oh added a third voice the shrouds of the chã teau dâ if are not dear 0257m perhaps said one of the previous speakers as he was a churchman they may go to some expense in his behalf â they may give him the honor of the sack edmond_dantã_s did not lose a word but comprehended very little of what was said the voice soon ceased and it seemed to him as if everyone had left the cell still he dared not to enter as they might have left some turnkey to watch the dead he remained therefore mute and motionless hardly venturing to breathe at the end of an hour he heard a faint noise which increased it was the governor who returned followed by the doctor and other attendants there was a momentâ silence â_it was evident that the doctor was examining the dead body the inquiries soon commenced
the doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed and declared that he was dead questions and answers followed in a nonchalant manner that made edmond_dantã_s indignant for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abbã a love and respect equal to his own i am very sorry for what you tell me said the governor replying to the assurance of the doctor that the old man is really dead for he was a quiet inoffensive prisoner happy in his folly and required no watching â ah added the turnkey there was no occasion for watching him he would have stayed here fifty year iâ ll answer for it without any attempt to escape â still said the governor i believe it will be requisite notwithstanding your certainty and not that i doubt your science but in discharge of my official duty that we should be perfectly assured that the prisoner is dead there was a moment of complete silence during which edmond_dantã_s still listening knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second time you may make your mind easy said the doctor he is dead i will answer for that â you know sir said the governor persisting that we are not content in such cases as this with such a simple examination in spite of all appearances be so kind therefore as to finish your duty by fulfilling the formalities described by law â let the irons be heated said the doctor but really it is a useless precaution this order to heat the irons made edmond_dantã_s shudder
he heard hasty step the creaking of a door people going and coming and some minute afterwards a turnkey entered saying here is the brazier lighted there was a momentâ silence and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where edmond_dantã_s was listening in horror the perspiration poured forth upon the young manâ brow and he felt as if he should faint you see sir he is really dead said the doctor this burn in the heel is decisive the poor fool is cured of his folly and delivered from his captivity â wasnâ his name abbã_faria inquired one of the officers who accompanied the governor 0259 â_yes sir and as he said it was an ancient name he was too very learned and rational enough on all points which did not relate to his treasure but on that indeed he was intractable â_it is the sort of malady which we call monomania said the doctor you had never anything to complain of said the governor to the jailer who had charge of the abbã never sir replied the jailer never on the contrary he sometimes amused me very much by telling me stories one day too when my wife was ill he gave me a prescription which cured her â ah ah said the doctor i did not know that i had a rival but i hope governor that you will show him all proper respect in consequence â_yes yes make your mind easy he shall be decently interred in the newest sack we can find will that satisfy you â must this last formality take place in your presence sir inquired a turnkey certainly
but make hasteâ i cannot stay here all day other footsteps going and coming were now heard and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached dantã sâ ears the bed creaked and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it this evening said the governor will there be any mass asked one of the attendants that is impossible replied the governor the chaplain of the chã teau came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence in order to take a trip to hyã res for a week i told him i would attend to the prisoners in his absence if the poor abbã had not been in such a hurry he might have had his requiem â pooh pooh said the doctor with the impiety usual in person of his profession he is a churchman god will respect his profession and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest a shout of laughter followed this brutal jest meanwhile the operation of putting the body in the sack was going on this evening said the governor when the task was ended at what hour inquired a turnkey why about ten or eleven oâ clock â shall we watch by the corpse â of what use would it be shut the dungeon as if he were aliveâ that is all then the step retreated and the voice died away in the distance the noise of the door with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued the silence of death which was all pervasive and struck its icy chill to the very soul of edmond_dantã_s then he raised the flag stone cautiously with his head and looked carefully around the chamber
it was empty and edmond_dantã_s emerged from the tunnel chapter 20 the cemetery of the chã teau dâ if on the bed at full length and faintly illuminated by the pale light that came from the window lay a sack of canvas and under its rude folds was stretched a long and stiffened form it was fariaâ last winding sheet a winding sheet which as the turnkey said cost so little everything was in readiness a barrier had been placed between edmond_dantã_s and his old friend no longer could edmond_dantã_s look into those wide open eye which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed abbã_faria the beneficent and cheerful companion with whom he was accustomed to live so intimately no longer breathed he seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed and fell into melancholy and gloomy reverie alone he was alone again again condemned to silenceâ again face to face with nothingness alone never again to see the face never again to hear the voice of the only human being who united him to earth was not fariaâ fate the better after allâ to solve the problem of life at its source even at the risk of horrible suffering the idea of suicide which his friend had driven away and kept away by his cheerful presence now hovered like a phantom over the abbã s dead body if i could die he said i should go where he goes and should assuredly find him again but how to die it is very easy he went on with a smile i will remain here rush on the first person that opens the door strangle him and then they will guillotine me
but excessive grief is like a storm at sea where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the wave edmond_dantã_s recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and liberty die oh no he exclaimedâ not die now after having lived and suffered so long and so much die yes had i died year ago but now to die would be indeed to give way to the sarcasm of destiny no i want to live i shall struggle to the very last i will yet win back the happiness of which i have been deprived before i die i must not forget that i have my executioners to punish and perhaps too who knows some friend to reward yet they will forget me here and i shall die in my dungeon like abbã_faria as he said this he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought suddenly he arose lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy paced twice or thrice round the dungeon and then paused abruptly by the bed just god he muttered whence comes this thought is it from thee
since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon let me take the place of the dead without giving himself time to reconsider his decision and indeed that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate resolution he bent over the appalling shroud opened it with the knife which abbã_faria had made drew the corpse from the sack and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber laid it on his couch tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own covered it with his counterpane once again kissed the ice cold brow and tried vainly to close the resisting eye which glared horribly turned the head towards the wall so that the jailer might when he brought the evening meal believe that he was asleep as was his frequent custom entered the tunnel again drew the bed against the wall returned to the other cell took from the hiding place the needle and thread flung off his rags that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas and getting inside the sack placed himself in the posture in which the dead body had been laid and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside he would have been discovered by the beating of his heart if by any mischance the jailers had entered at that moment edmond_dantã_s might have waited until the evening visit was over but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind and order the dead body to be removed earlier in that case his last hope would have been destroyed now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to do
if while he was being carried out the grave diggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body edmond_dantã_s did not intend to give them time to recognize him but with a sudden cut of the knife he meant to open the sack from top to bottom and profiting by their alarm escape if they tried to catch him he would use his knife to better purpose 0263 if they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave he would allow himself to be covered with earth and then as it was night the grave diggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped he hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome it if he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy he would be stifled and thenâ so much the better all would be over edmond_dantã_s had not eaten since the preceding evening but he had not thought of hunger nor did he think of it now his situation was too precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one the first risk that edmond_dantã_s ran was that the jailer when he brought him his supper at seven oâ clock might perceive the change that had been made fortunately twenty time at least from misanthropy or fatigue edmond_dantã_s had received his jailer in bed and then the man placed his bread and soup on the table and went away without saying a word this time the jailer might not be as silent as usual but speak to edmond_dantã_s and seeing that he received no reply go to the bed and thus discover all
when seven oâ clock came dantã sâ agony really began his hand placed upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings while with the other he wiped the perspiration from his temples from time to time chills ran through his whole body and clutched his heart in a grasp of ice then he thought he was going to die yet the hour passed on without any unusual disturbance and edmond_dantã_s knew that he had escaped the first peril it was a good augury at length about the hour the governor had appointed footsteps were heard on the stairs edmond_dantã_s felt that the moment had arrived summoned up all his courage held his breath and would have been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his veins the footstepsâ they were doubleâ paused at the doorâ and edmond_dantã_s guessed that the two grave diggers had come to seek himâ this idea was soon converted into certainty when he heard the noise they made in putting down the hand bier the door opened and a dim light reached dantã sâ eye through the coarse sack that covered him he saw two shadows approach his bed a third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand the two man approaching the end of the bed took the sack by its extremities heâ heavy though for an old and thin man said one as he raised the head they say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones said another lifting the foot have you tied the knot inquired the first speaker what would be the use of carrying so much more weight was the reply i can do that when we get there â_yes youâ re right replied the companion whatâ the knot for thought edmond_dantã_s
they deposited the supposed corpse on the bier edmond_dantã_s stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man and then the party lighted by the man with the torch who went first ascended the stairs suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air and edmond_dantã_s knew that the mistral was blowing it was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely mingled the bearers went on for twenty paces then stopped putting the bier down on the ground one of them went away and edmond_dantã_s heard his shoes striking on the pavement where am i he asked himself really he is by no means a light load said the other bearer sitting on the edge of the hand barrow dantã sâ first impulse was to escape but fortunately he did not attempt it give us a light said the other bearer or i shall never find what i am looking for the man with the torch complied although not asked in the most polite terms what can he be looking for thought edmond_dantã_s the spade perhaps an exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the grave digger had found the object of his search here it is at last he said not without some trouble though â_yes was the answer but it has lost nothing by waiting as he said this the man came towards edmond_dantã_s who heard a heavy metallic substance laid down beside him and at the same moment a cord was fastened round his foot with sudden and painful violence well have you tied the knot inquired the grave digger who was looking on â_yes and pretty tight too i can tell you was the answer move on then and the bier was lifted once more and they proceeded
they advanced fifty paces farther and then stopped to open a door then went forward again the noise of the waves dashing against the rocks on which the chã teau is built reached dantã sâ ear distinctly as they went forward bad weather observed one of the bearers not a pleasant night for a dip in the sea â why yes the abbã runs a chance of being wet said the other and then there was a burst of brutal laughter edmond_dantã_s did not comprehend the jest but his hair stood erect on his head well here we are at last said one of them a little fartherâ a little farther said the other you know very well that the last was stopped on his way dashed on the rocks and the governor told us next day that we were careless fellows they ascended five or six more step and then edmond_dantã_s felt that they took him one by the head and the other by the heels and swung him to and fro one said the grave diggers two three and at the same instant edmond_dantã_s felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird falling falling with a rapidity that made his blood curdle although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century at last with a horrible splash he darted like an arrow into the ice cold water and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry stifled in a moment by his immersion beneath the waves edmond_dantã_s had been flung into the sea and was dragged into its depths by a thirty six pound shot tied to his foot the sea is the cemetery of the chã teau dâ if 0267m chapter 21
the island of tiboulen edmond_dantã_s although stunned and almost suffocated had sufficient presence of mind to hold his breath and as his right hand prepared as he was for every chance held his knife open he rapidly ripped up the sack extricated his arm and then his body but in spite of all his efforts to free himself from the shot he felt it dragging him down still lower he then bent his body and by a desperate effort severed the cord that bound his legs at the moment when it seemed as if he were actually strangled with a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud edmond_dantã_s waited only to get breath and then dived in order to avoid being seen when he arose a second time he was fifty paces from where he had first sunk he saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear before him was the vast expanse of waters sombre and terrible whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm behind him blacker than the sea blacker than the sky rose phantom like the vast stone structure whose projecting crags seemed like arm extended to seize their prey and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures he fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea doubtless these strange grave diggers had heard his cry edmond_dantã_s dived again and remained a long time beneath the water
this was an easy feat to him for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at marseilles when he swam there and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the port when he came up again the light had disappeared he must now get his bearings ratonneau and pomã gue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the chã teau dâ if but ratonneau and pomã gue are inhabited as is also the islet of daume tiboulen and lemaire were therefore the safest for dantã sâ venture the islands of tiboulen and lemaire are a league from the chã teau dâ if edmond_dantã_s nevertheless determined to make for them but how could he find his way in the darkness of the night at this moment he saw the light of planier gleaming in front of him like a star by leaving this light on the right he kept the island of tiboulen a little on the left by turning to the left therefore he would find it but as we have said it was at least a league from the chã teau dâ if to this island often in prison abbã_faria had said to him when he saw him idle and inactive edmond_dantã_s you must not give way to this listlessness you will be drowned if you seek to escape and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion these word rang in dantã sâ ears even beneath the waves he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength he found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a boy
fear that relentless pursuer clogged dantã sâ efforts he listened for any sound that might be audible and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon and strove to penetrate the darkness he fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat and he redoubled his exertions increasing rapidly his distance from the chã teau but exhausting his strength he swam on still and already the terrible chã teau had disappeared in the darkness he could not see it but he felt its presence an hour passed during which edmond_dantã_s excited by the feeling of freedom continued to cleave the waves let us see said he i have swum above an hour but as the wind is against me that has retarded my speed however if i am not mistaken i must be close to tiboulen but what if i were mistaken a shudder passed over him he sought to tread water in order to rest himself but the sea was too violent and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation well said he i will swim on until i am worn out or the cramp seizes me and then i shall sink and he struck out with the energy of despair suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee he fancied for a moment that he had been shot and listened for the report but he heard nothing then he put out his hand and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore
before him rose a grotesque mass of rocks that resembled nothing so much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent combustion it was the island of tiboulen edmond_dantã_s rose advanced a few step and with a fervent prayer of gratitude stretched himself on the granite which seemed to him softer than down then in spite of the wind and rain he fell into the deep sweet sleep of utter exhaustion at the expiration of an hour edmond_dantã_s was awakened by the roar of thunder the tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic waves edmond_dantã_s had not been deceivedâ he had reached the first of the two islands which was in fact tiboulen he knew that it was barren and without shelter but when the sea became more calm he resolved to plunge into its waves again and swim to lemaire equally arid but larger and consequently better adapted for concealment an overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury edmond_dantã_s felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay the waves dashing themselves against it wetted him with their spray he was safely sheltered and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning it seemed to him that the island trembled to its base and that it would like a vessel at anchor break moorings and bear him off into the centre of the storm
he then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for four and twenty hour he extended his hand and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the rock as he rose a flash of lightning that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven illumined the darkness by its light between the island of lemaire and cape croiselle a quarter of a league distant edmond_dantã_s saw a fishing boat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and waves a second after he saw it again approaching with frightful rapidity edmond_dantã_s cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger but they saw it themselves another flash showed him four man clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging while a fifth clung to the broken rudder the man he beheld saw him undoubtedly for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast sea bird at the same moment a violent crash was heard and cries of distress edmond_dantã_s from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors then all was dark again edmond_dantã_s ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces he listened he groped about but he heard and saw nothingâ the cries had ceased and the tempest continued to rage by degrees the wind abated vast gray clouds rolled towards the west and the blue firmament appeared studded with bright stars
soon a red streak became visible in the horizon the waves whitened a light played over them and gilded their foaming crests with gold it was day edmond_dantã_s stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle as if he now beheld it for the first time and indeed since his captivity in the chã teau dâ if he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed he turned towards the fortress and looked at both sea and land the gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene it was about five oâ clock the sea continued to get calmer in two or three hour thought edmond_dantã_s the turnkey will enter my chamber find the body of my poor friend recognize it seek for me in vain and give the alarm then the tunnel will be discovered the man who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry i uttered will be questioned then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched fugitive the cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and famished the police of marseilles will be on the alert by land whilst the governor pursues me by sea i am cold i am hungry i have lost even the knife that saved me oh my god i have suffered enough surely
have pity on me and do for me what i am unable to do for myself as edmond_dantã_s his eye turned in the direction of the chã teau dâ if uttered this prayer he saw off the farther point of the island of pomã gue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey and with his sailorâ eye he knew it to be a genoese tartan she was coming out of marseilles harbor and was standing out to sea rapidly her sharp prow cleaving through the waves â_oh cried edmond_dantã_s to think that in half an hour i could join her did i not fear being questioned detected and conveyed back to marseilles what can i do what story can i invent under pretext of trading along the coast these man who are in reality smugglers will prefer selling me to doing a good action i must wait but i cannotâ i am starving in a few hour my strength will be utterly exhausted besides perhaps i have not been missed at the fortress i can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last night my story will be accepted for there is no one left to contradict me as he spoke edmond_dantã_s looked toward the spot where the fishing vessel had been wrecked and started the red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vesselâ keel floated at the foot of the crag in an instant dantã sâ plan was formed he swam to the cap placed it on his head seized one of the timbers and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was taking i am saved murmured he and this conviction restored his strength
he soon saw that the vessel with the wind dead ahead was tacking between the chã teau dâ if and the tower of planier for an instant he feared lest instead of keeping in shore she should stand out to sea but he soon saw that she would pass like most vessels bound for italy between the islands of jaros and calaseraigne however the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him he rose on the waves making signs of distress but no one on board saw him and the vessel stood on another tack edmond_dantã_s would have shouted but he knew that the wind would drown his voice it was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber for without it he would have been unable perhaps to reach the vesselâ certainly to return to shore should he be unsuccessful in attracting attention edmond_dantã_s though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him then he advanced but before they could meet the vessel again changed her course by a violent effort he rose half out of the water waving his cap and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors this time he was both seen and heard and the tartan instantly steered towards him at the same time he saw they were about to lower the boat an instant after the boat rowed by two man advanced rapidly towards him edmond_dantã_s let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorously to meet them
but he had reckoned too much upon his strength and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to him his arm became stiff his legs lost their flexibility and he was almost breathless he shouted again the two sailors redoubled their efforts and one of them cried in italian courage the word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his head he rose again to the surface struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man uttered a third cry and felt himself sinking as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his foot the water passed over his head and the sky turned gray a convulsive movement again brought him to the surface he felt himself seized by the hair then he saw and heard nothing he had fainted when he opened his eye edmond_dantã_s found himself on the deck of the tartan his first care was to see what course they were taking they were rapidly leaving the chã teau dâ if behind edmond_dantã_s was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh as we have said he was lying on the deck a sailor was rubbing his limbs with a woollen cloth another whom he recognized as the one who had cried out courage held a gourd full of rum to his mouth while the third an old sailor at once the pilot and captain looked on with that egotistical pity man feel for a misfortune that they have escaped yesterday and which may overtake them tomorrow a few drops of the rum restored suspended animation while the friction of his limbs restored their elasticity who are you said the pilot in bad french
â i am replied edmond_dantã_s in bad italian a maltese sailor we were coming from syracuse laden with grain the storm of last night overtook us at cape morgiou and we were wrecked on these rocks â where do you come from â from these rocks that i had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all lost i saw your vessel and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island i swam off on a piece of wreckage to try and intercept your course you have saved my life and i thank you continued edmond_dantã_s i was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my hair â_it was i said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance and it was time for you were sinking â_yes returned edmond_dantã_s holding out his hand i thank you again â i almost hesitated though replied the sailor you looked more like a brigand than an honest man with your beard six inches and your hair a foot long edmond_dantã_s recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the time he was at the chã teau dâ if â_yes said he i made a vow to our lady of the grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten year if i were saved in a moment of danger but today the vow expires â now what are we to do with you said the captain alas anything you please my captain is dead i have barely escaped but i am a good sailor leave me at the first port you make i shall be sure to find employment â do
you know the mediterranean â i have sailed over it since my childhood â you know the best harbors â there are few ports that i could not enter or leave with a bandage over my eye â i say captain said the sailor who had cried courage to edmond_dantã_s if what he says is true what hinders his staying with us â if he says true said the captain doubtingly but in his present condition he will promise anything and take his chance of keeping it afterwards â i will do more than i promise said edmond_dantã_s we shall see returned the other smiling where are you going asked edmond_dantã_s to leghorn â then why instead of tacking so frequently do you not sail nearer the wind â because we should run straight on to the island of rion â you shall pass it by twenty fathoms â take the helm and let us see what you know the young man took the helm felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly and seeing that without being a first rate sailor she yet was tolerably obedient to the sheets said he the four seamen who composed the crew obeyed while the pilot looked on haul taut they obeyed belay this order was also executed and the vessel passed as edmond_dantã_s had predicted twenty fathoms to windward bravo said the captain bravo repeated the sailors and they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor they had not thought him capable of showing you see said edmond_dantã_s quitting the helm i shall be of some use to you at least during the voyage
if you do not want me at leghorn you can leave me there and i will pay you out of the first wages i get for my food and the clothes you lend me â ah said the captain we can agree very well if you are reasonable â give me what you give the others and it will be all right returned edmond_dantã_s thatâ not fair said the seaman who had saved edmond_dantã_s for you know more than we do â what is that to you jacopo_manfredi returned the captain everyone is free to ask what he pleases â thatâ true replied jacopo_manfredi i only make a remark â well you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers if you have them â no said jacopo_manfredi but i have a shirt and a pair of trousers â that is all i want interrupted edmond_dantã_s jacopo_manfredi dived into the hold and soon returned with what edmond_dantã_s wanted now then do you wish for anything else said the patron a piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum i tasted for i have not eaten or drunk for a long time he had not tasted food for forty hour a piece of bread was brought and jacopo_manfredi offered him the gourd larboard your helm cried the captain to the steersman edmond_dantã_s glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth then paused with hand in mid air hollo whatâ the matter at the chã teau dâ if said the captain a small white cloud which had attracted dantã sâ attention crowned the summit of the bastion of the chã teau dâ if at the same moment the faint report of a gun was heard the sailors looked at one another what is this asked the captain
â a prisoner has escaped from the chã teau dâ if and they are firing the alarm gun replied edmond_dantã_s the captain glanced at him but he had lifted the rum to his lip and was drinking it with so much composure that suspicions if the captain had any died away 0277m pretty strong rum said edmond_dantã_s wiping his brow with his sleeve at any rate murmured he if it be so much the better for i have made a rare acquisition 0279 under pretence of being fatigued edmond_dantã_s asked to take the helm the steersman glad to be relieved looked at the captain and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade edmond_dantã_s could thus keep his eye on marseilles what is the day of the month asked he of jacopo_manfredi who sat down beside him the 28th of february â in what year â in what yearâ you ask me in what year â_yes replied the young man i ask you in what year â you have forgotten then â i got such a fright last night replied edmond_dantã_s smiling that i have almost lost my memory i ask you what year is it â the year 1829 returned jacopo_manfredi it was fourteen year day for day since dantã sâ arrest he was nineteen when he entered the chã teau dâ if he was thirty three when he escaped a sorrowful smile passed over his face he asked himself what had become of mercã_dã_s who must believe him dead then his eye lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three man who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity he renewed against mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_fernand_mondego and m_noirtier_de_villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon
this oath was no longer a vain menace for the fastest sailor in the mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to leghorn chapter 22 the smugglers edmond_dantã_s had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the man with whom his lot had been cast without having been in the school of the abbã_faria the worthy master of la_jeune_amã_lie the name of the genoese tartan knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the mediterranean from the arabic to the provenã al and this while it spared him interpreters person always troublesome and frequently indiscreet gave him great facilities of communication either with the vessels he met at sea with the small boats sailing along the coast or with the people without name country or occupation who are always seen on the quays of seaports and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of providence as they have no visible means of support it is fair to assume that edmond_dantã_s was on board a smuggler at first the captain had received edmond_dantã_s on board with a certain degree of distrust he was very well known to the customs officers of the coast and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits he had at first thought that edmond_dantã_s might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade
but the skilful manner in which edmond_dantã_s had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him and then when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the chã teau dâ if and heard the distant report he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going like that of kings was accompanied with salutes of artillery this made him less uneasy it must be owned than if the new comer had proved to be a customs officer but this supposition also disappeared like the first when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit edmond_dantã_s thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was without the owner knowing who he was and however the old sailor and his crew tried to pumpâ him they extracted nothing more from him he gave accurate descriptions of naples and malta which he knew as well as marseilles and held stoutly to his first story thus the genoese subtle as he was was duped by edmond_dantã_s in whose favor his mild demeanor his nautical skill and his admirable dissimulation pleaded moreover it is possible that the genoese was one of those shrewd person who know nothing but what they should know and believe nothing but what they should believe in this state of mutual understanding they reached leghorn here edmond_dantã_s was to undergo another trial he was to find out whether he could recognize himself as he had not seen his own face for fourteen year he had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been and was now to find out what the man had become his comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled
as he had twenty time touched at leghorn he remembered a barber in st ferdinand street he went there to have his beard and hair cut the barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long thick and black hair and beard which gave his head the appearance of one of titianâ portraits at this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them the leghorn barber said nothing and went to work when the operation was concluded and edmond_dantã_s felt that his chin was completely smooth and his hair reduced to its usual length he asked for a looking glass he was now as we have said three and thirty year of age and his fourteen yearsâ imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his appearance edmond_dantã_s had entered the chã teau dâ if with the round open smiling face of a young and happy man with whom the early paths of life have been smooth and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past this was now all changed
the oval face was lengthened his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought his eye were full of melancholy and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred his complexion so long kept from the sun had now that pale color which produces when the features are encircled with black hair the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression and he had also acquired being naturally of a goodly stature that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself 0283 to the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular figure as to his voice prayers sobs and imprecations had changed it so that at time it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness and at others rough and almost hoarse moreover from being so long in twilight or darkness his eye had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night common to the hyena and the wolf edmond_dantã_s smiled when he beheld himself it was impossible that his best friendâ if indeed he had any friend leftâ could recognize him he could not recognize himself the master of la_jeune_amã_lie who was very desirous of retaining amongst his crew a man of edmondâ value had offered to advance him funds out of his future profits which edmond_dantã_s had accepted
his next care on leaving the barberâ who had achieved his first metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailorâ suitâ a garb as we all know very simple and consisting of white trousers a striped shirt and a cap it was in this costume and bringing back to jacopo_manfredi the shirt and trousers he had lent him that edmond_dantã_s reappeared before the captain of the lugger who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard hair tangled with seaweed and body soaking in seabrine whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned attracted by his prepossessing appearance he renewed his offers of an engagement to edmond_dantã_s but edmond_dantã_s who had his own projects would not agree for a longer time than three month la_jeune_amã_lie had a very active crew very obedient to their captain who lost as little time as possible he had scarcely been a week at leghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with printed muslins contraband cottons english powder and tobacco on which the excise had forgotten to put its mark the master was to get all this out of leghorn free of duties and land it on the shores of corsica where certain speculators undertook to forward the cargo to france they sailed edmond_dantã_s was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth and which he had so often dreamed of in prison he left gorgone on his right and la pianosa on his left and went towards the country of paoli and napoleon
the next morning going on deck as he always did at an early hour the patron found edmond_dantã_s leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense earnestness at a pile of granite rocks which the rising sun tinged with rosy light it was the island of count_of_monte_cristo la_jeune_amã_lie left it three quarters of a league to the larboard and kept on for corsica edmond_dantã_s thought as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land but then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure without arm to defend himself besides what would the sailors say what would the patron think he must wait fortunately edmond_dantã_s had learned how to wait he had waited fourteen year for his liberty and now he was free he could wait at least six month or a year for wealth would he not have accepted liberty without riches if it had been offered to him besides were not those riches chimerical offspring of the brain of the poor abbã_faria had they not died with him it is true the letter of the cardinal_spada was singularly circumstantial and edmond_dantã_s repeated it to himself from one end to the other for he had not forgotten a word 0285m evening came and edmond_dantã_s saw the island tinged with the shades of twilight and then disappear in the darkness from all eye but his own for he with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison continued to behold it last of all for he remained alone upon deck
the next morn broke off the coast of aleria all day they coasted and in the evening saw fires lighted on land the position of these was no doubt a signal for landing for a shipâ lantern was hung up at the mast head instead of the streamer and they came to within a gunshot of the shore edmond_dantã_s noticed that the captain of la_jeune_amã_lie had as he neared the land mounted two small culverins which without making much noise can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so but on this occasion the precaution was superfluous and everything proceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness four shallops came off with very little noise alongside the lugger which no doubt in acknowledgement of the compliment lowered her own shallop into the sea and the five boats worked so well that by two oâ clock in the morning all the cargo was out of la_jeune_amã_lie and on terra firma the same night such a man of regularity was the patron of la_jeune_amã_lie the profits were divided and each man had a hundred tuscan livres or about eighty franc but the voyage was not ended they turned the bowsprit towards sardinia where they intended to take in a cargo which was to replace what had been discharged the second operation was as successful as the first la_jeune_amã_lie was in luck this new cargo was destined for the coast of the duchy of lucca and consisted almost entirely of havana cigars sherry and malaga wines there they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties the excise was in truth the everlasting enemy of the patron of la_jeune_amã_lie
a customs officer was laid low and two sailors wounded edmond_dantã_s was one of the latter a ball having touched him in the left shoulder edmond_dantã_s was almost glad of this affray and almost pleased at being wounded for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger and with what endurance he could bear suffering he had contemplated danger with a smile and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher pain thou art not an evil he had moreover looked upon the customs officer wounded to death and whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter or the chill of human sentiment this sight had made but slight impression upon him edmond_dantã_s was on the way he desired to follow and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom jacopo_manfredi seeing him fall had believed him killed and rushing towards him raised him up and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted comrade this world was not then so good as doctor pangloss believed it neither was it so wicked as edmond_dantã_s thought it since this man who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prize money manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall fortunately as we have said edmond_dantã_s was only wounded and with certain herbs gathered at certain seasons and sold to the smugglers by the old sardinian woman the wound soon closed edmond_dantã_s then resolved to try jacopo_manfredi and offered him in return for his attention a share of his prize money but jacopo_manfredi refused it indignantly
as a result of the sympathetic devotion which jacopo_manfredi had from the first bestowed on edmond_dantã_s the latter was moved to a certain degree of affection but this sufficed for jacopo_manfredi who instinctively felt that edmond_dantã_s had a right to superiority of positionâ a superiority which edmond_dantã_s had concealed from all others and from this time the kindness which edmond_dantã_s showed him was enough for the brave seaman then in the long day on board ship when the vessel gliding on with security over the azure sea required no care but the hand of the helmsman thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails edmond_dantã_s with a chart in his hand became the instructor of jacopo_manfredi as the poor abbã_faria had been his tutor he pointed out to him the bearings of the coast explained to him the variations of the compass and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our head which they call heaven and where god writes in azure with letter of diamonds and when jacopo_manfredi inquired of him what is the use of teaching all these thing to a poor sailor like me edmond_dantã_s replied who knows you may one day be the captain of a vessel your fellow countryman bonaparte became emperor we had forgotten to say that jacopo_manfredi was a corsican two month and a half elapsed in these trips and edmond_dantã_s had become as skilful a coaster as he had been a hardy seaman he had formed an acquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast and learned all the masonic signs by which these half pirates recognize each other he had passed and re passed his island of count_of_monte_cristo twenty time but not once had he found an opportunity of landing there he then formed a resolution
as soon as his engagement with the patron of la_jeune_amã_lie ended he would hire a small vessel on his own accountâ for in his several voyages he had amassed a hundred piastresâ and under some pretext land at the island of count_of_monte_cristo then he would be free to make his researches not perhaps entirely at liberty for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied him but in this world we must risk something prison had made edmond_dantã_s prudent and he was desirous of running no risk whatever but in vain did he rack his imagination fertile as it was he could not devise any plan for reaching the island without companionship edmond_dantã_s was tossed about on these doubts and wishes when the patron who had great confidence in him and was very desirous of retaining him in his service took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern on the via delâ oglio where the leading smugglers of leghorn used to congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade already edmond_dantã_s had visited this maritime bourse two or three time and seeing all these hardy free traders who supplied the whole coast for nearly two hundred leagues in extent he had asked himself what power might not that man attain who should give the impulse of his will to all these contrary and diverging mind this time it was a great matter that was under discussion connected with a vessel laden with turkey carpets stuffs of the levant and cashmeres it was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made and then to try and land these goods on the coast of france
if the venture was successful the profit would be enormous there would be a gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the crew the patron of la_jeune_amã_lie proposed as a place of landing the island of count_of_monte_cristo which being completely deserted and having neither soldiers nor revenue officers seemed to have been placed in the midst of the ocean since the time of the heathen olympus by mercury the god of merchants and robbers classes of mankind which we in modern time have separated if not made distinct but which antiquity appears to have included in the same category at the mention of count_of_monte_cristo edmond_dantã_s started with joy he rose to conceal his emotion and took a turn around the smoky tavern where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a lingua franca when he again joined the two person who had been discussing the matter it had been decided that they should touch at count_of_monte_cristo and set out on the following night edmond_dantã_s being consulted was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security and that great enterprises to be well done should be done quickly nothing then was altered in the plan and order were given to get under weigh next night and wind and weather permitting to make the neutral island by the following day 0289 chapter 23 the island of count_of_monte_cristo thus at length by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny edmond_dantã_s was about to secure the opportunity he wished for by simple and natural means and land on the island without incurring any suspicion one night more and he would be on his way
the night was one of feverish distraction and in its progress visions good and evil passed through dantã sâ mind if he closed his eye he saw cardinal spadaâ letter written on the wall in characters of flameâ if he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain he ascended into grottos paved with emeralds with panels of rubies and the roof glowing with diamond stalactites pearls fell drop by drop as subterranean waters filter in their caves edmond_dantã_s amazed wonderstruck filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles he then endeavored to re enter the marvellous grottos but they had suddenly receded and now the path became a labyrinth and then the entrance vanished and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of ali_pasha_of_yanina baba to the arabian fisherman all was useless the treasure disappeared and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it off the day came at length and was almost as feverish as the night had been but it brought reason to the aid of imagination and edmond_dantã_s was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain night came and with it the preparation for departure and these preparations served to conceal dantã sâ agitation he had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board and as his order were always clear distinct and easy of execution his comrades obeyed him with celerity and pleasure the old patron did not interfere for he too had recognized the superiority of edmond_dantã_s over the crew and himself
he saw in the young man his natural successor and regretted that he had not a daughter that he might have bound edmond_dantã_s to him by a more secure alliance at seven oâ clock in the evening all was ready and at ten minute past seven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled the sea was calm and with a fresh breeze from the south east they sailed beneath a bright blue sky in which god also lighted up in turn his beacon light each of which is a world edmond_dantã_s told them that all hand might turn in and he would take the helm when the maltese for so they called edmond_dantã_s had said this it was sufficient and all went to their bunks contentedly this frequently happened edmond_dantã_s cast from solitude into the world frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude and what solitude is more complete or more poetical than that of a ship floating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night in the silence of immensity and under the eye of heaven now this solitude was peopled with his thoughts the night lighted up by his illusions and the silence animated by his anticipations when the patron awoke the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set and every sail full with the breeze they were making nearly ten knots an hour the island of count_of_monte_cristo loomed large in the horizon edmond_dantã_s resigned the lugger to the masterâ care and went and lay down in his hammock but in spite of a sleepless night he could not close his eye for a moment two hour afterwards he came on deck as the boat was about to double the island of elba
they were just abreast of mareciana and beyond the flat but verdant island of la pianosa the peak of count_of_monte_cristo reddened by the burning sun was seen against the azure sky edmond_dantã_s ordered the helmsman to put down his helm in order to leave la pianosa to starboard as he knew that he should shorten his course by two or three knots about five oâ clock in the evening the island was distinct and everything on it was plainly perceptible owing to that clearness of the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its setting edmond_dantã_s gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors from the brightest pink to the deepest blue and from time to time his cheeks flushed his brow darkened and a mist passed over his eye never did a gamester whose whole fortune is staked on one cast of the die experience the anguish which edmond_dantã_s felt in his paroxysms of hope night came and at ten oâ clock they anchored la_jeune_amã_lie was first at the rendezvous in spite of his usual command over himself edmond_dantã_s could not restrain his impetuosity he was the first to jump on shore and had he dared he would like lucius brutus have kissed his mother earth â_it was dark but at eleven oâ clock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean whose every wave she silvered and then ascending high played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second pelion the island was familiar to the crew of la_jeune_amã_lie â_it was one of her regular haunts as to edmond_dantã_s he had passed it on his voyage to and from the levant but never touched at it
he questioned jacopo_manfredi where shall we pass the night he inquired why on board the tartan replied the sailor should we not do better in the grottos â what grottos â why the grottosâ caves of the island â i do not know of any grottos replied jacopo_manfredi the cold sweat sprang forth on dantã sâ brow what are there no grottos at count_of_monte_cristo he asked none for a moment edmond_dantã_s was speechless then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident or even stopped up for the sake of greater security by cardinal_spada the point was then to discover the hidden entrance it was useless to search at night and edmond_dantã_s therefore delayed all investigation until the morning besides a signal made half a league out at sea and to which la_jeune_amã_lie replied by a similar signal indicated that the moment for business had come the boat that now arrived assured by the answering signal that all was well soon came in sight white and silent as a phantom and cast anchor within a cableâ length of shore then the landing began edmond_dantã_s reflected as he worked on the shout of joy which with a single word he could evoke from all these man if he gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart but far from disclosing this precious secret he almost feared that he had already said too much and by his restlessness and continual questions his minute observations and evident preoccupation aroused suspicions fortunately as regarded this circumstance at least his painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness and the glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but transitory
no one had the slightest suspicion and when next day taking a fowling piece powder and shot edmond_dantã_s declared his intention to go and kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock his wish was construed into a love of sport or a desire for solitude however jacopo_manfredi insisted on following him and edmond_dantã_s did not oppose this fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust scarcely however had they gone a quarter of a league when having killed a kid he begged jacopo_manfredi to take it to his comrades and request them to cook it and when ready to let him know by firing a gun this and some dried fruits and a flask of monte pulciano was the bill of fare edmond_dantã_s went on looking from time to time behind and around about him having reached the summit of a rock he saw a thousand foot beneath him his companions whom jacopo_manfredi had rejoined and who were all busy preparing the repast which edmondâ skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital dish edmond_dantã_s looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows in two hoursâ time said he these person will depart richer by fifty piastres each to go and risk their life again by endeavoring to gain fifty more then they will return with a fortune of six hundred franc and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of sultans and the insolence of nabobs at this moment hope makes me despise their riches which seem to me contemptible yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me that i shall on compulsion consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost happiness
oh no exclaimed edmond_dantã_s that will not be the wise unerring abbã_faria could not be mistaken in this one thing besides it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched life thus edmond_dantã_s who but three month before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough and panted for wealth the cause was not in edmond_dantã_s but in providence who while limiting the power of man has filled him with boundless desires meanwhile by a cleft between two wall of rock following a path worn by a torrent and which in all human probability human foot had never before trod edmond_dantã_s approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed keeping along the shore and examining the smallest object with serious attention he thought he could trace on certain rocks marks made by the hand of man time which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle as it invests all thing of the mind with forgetfulness seemed to have respected these signs which apparently had been made with some degree of regularity and probably with a definite purpose occasionally the marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle which spread into large bushes laden with blossoms or beneath parasitical lichen so edmond_dantã_s had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guide marks were the sight of marks renewed edmond_dantã_s fondest hopes might it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them in order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe which he could not foresee would have been so complete this solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of burying treasure
only might not these betraying marks have attracted other eye than those for whom they were made and had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret 0295 it seemed however to edmond_dantã_s who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased nor did they terminate at any grotto a large round rock placed solidly on its base was the only spot to which they seemed to lead edmond_dantã_s concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning and he therefore turned round and retraced his step meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast had got some water from a spring spread out the fruit and bread and cooked the kid just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit they saw edmond_dantã_s springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock and they fired the signal agreed upon the sportsman instantly changed his direction and ran quickly towards them but even while they watched his daring progress edmondâ foot slipped and they saw him stagger on the edge of a rock and disappear they all rushed towards him for all loved edmond_dantã_s in spite of his superiority yet jacopo_manfredi reached him first he found edmond_dantã_s lying prone bleeding and almost senseless he had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen foot they poured a little rum down his throat and this remedy which had before been so beneficial to him produced the same effect as formerly edmond_dantã_s opened his eye complained of great pain in his knee a feeling of heaviness in his head and severe pains in his loins
they wished to carry him to the shore but when they touched him although under jacopoâ directions he declared with heavy groans that he could not bear to be moved it may be supposed that edmond_dantã_s did not now think of his dinner but he insisted that his comrades who had not his reasons for fasting should have their meal as for himself he declared that he had only need of a little rest and that when they returned he should be easier the sailors did not require much urging they were hungry and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory and your tars are not very ceremonious an hour afterwards they returned all that edmond_dantã_s had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a moss grown rock but instead of growing easier dantã sâ pains appeared to increase in violence the old patron who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his cargo on the frontiers of piedmont and france between nice and frã jus urged edmond_dantã_s to try and rise edmond_dantã_s made great exertions in order to comply but at each effort he fell back moaning and turning pale he has broken his ribs said the commander in a low voice no matter he is an excellent fellow and we must not leave him we will try and carry him on board the tartan edmond_dantã_s declared however that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him well said the patron let what may happen it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you we will not go till evening this very much astonished the sailors although not one opposed it
the patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise or even delay in its execution edmond_dantã_s would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor no no he said to the patron i was awkward and it is just that i pay the penalty of my clumsiness leave me a small supply of biscuit a gun powder and balls to kill the kids or defend myself at need and a pickaxe that i may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me â but youâ ll die of hunger said the patron i would rather do so was edmondâ reply than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me the patron turned towards his vessel which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor and with sails partly set would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed what are we to do maltese asked the captain we cannot leave you here so and yet we cannot stay â go go exclaimed edmond_dantã_s we shall be absent at least a week said the patron and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up again â why said edmond_dantã_s if in two or three day you hail any fishing boat desire them to come here to me i will pay twenty five piastres for my passage back to leghorn if you do not come across one return for me the patron shook his head listen captain baldi thereâ one way of settling this said jacopo_manfredi
â do you go and i will stay and take care of the wounded man â and give up your share of the venture said edmond_dantã_s to remain with me â_yes said jacopo_manfredi and without any hesitation â you are a good fellow and a kind hearted messmate replied edmond_dantã_s and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions but i do not wish anyone to stay with me a day or two of rest will set me up and i hope i shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for bruises a peculiar smile passed over dantã sâ lip he squeezed jacopoâ hand warmly but nothing could shake his determination to remainâ and remain alone the smugglers left with edmond_dantã_s what he had requested and set sail but not without turning about several time and each time making signs of a cordial farewell to which edmond_dantã_s replied with his hand only as if he could not move the rest of his body then when they had disappeared he said with a smile â tis strange that it should be among such man that we find proofs of friendship and devotion then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock from which he had a full view of the sea and thence he saw the tartan complete her preparations for sailing weigh anchor and balancing herself as gracefully as a water fowl ere it takes to the wing set sail at the end of an hour she was completely out of sight at least it was impossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where he was
then edmond_dantã_s rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated and now he exclaimed remembering the tale of the arabian fisherman which abbã_faria had related to him now open sesame chapter 24 the secret cave the sun had nearly reached the meridian and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks which seemed themselves sensible of the heat thousands of grasshoppers hidden in the bushes chirped with a monotonous and dull note the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the wind at every step that edmond_dantã_s took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag in a word the island was inhabited yet edmond_dantã_s felt himself alone guided by the hand of god he felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dreadâ that dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and observed this feeling was so strong that at the moment when edmond_dantã_s was about to begin his labor he stopped laid down his pickaxe seized his gun mounted to the summit of the highest rock and from thence gazed round in every direction but it was not upon corsica the very house of which he could distinguish or on sardinia or on the island of elba with its historical associations or upon the almost imperceptible line that to the experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of genoa the proud and leghorn the commercial that he gazed
it was at the brigantine that had left in the morning and the tartan that had just set sail that edmond_dantã_s fixed his eye the first was just disappearing in the straits of bonifacio the other following an opposite direction was about to round the island of corsica this sight reassured him he then looked at the objects near him he saw that he was on the highest point of the island a statue on this vast pedestal of granite nothing human appearing in sight while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island and covered it with a fringe of foam then he descended with cautious and slow step for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality edmond_dantã_s as we have said had traced the marks along the rocks and he had noticed that they led to a small creek which was hidden like the bath of some ancient nymph this creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth and deep in the centre to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class which would be perfectly concealed from observation then following the clew that in the hand of the abbã_faria had been so skilfully used to guide him through the dã dalian labyrinth of probabilities he thought that the cardinal_spada anxious not to be watched had entered the creek concealed his little barque followed the line marked by the notches in the rock and at the end of it had buried his treasure it was this idea that had brought edmond_dantã_s back to the circular rock one thing only perplexed edmond_dantã_s and destroyed his theory
how could this rock which weighed several tons have been lifted to this spot without the aid of many man suddenly an idea flashed across his mind instead of raising it thought he they have lowered it and he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly stood he soon perceived that a slope had been formed and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied a large stone had served as a wedge flints and pebbles had been inserted around it so as to conceal the orifice this species of masonry had been covered with earth and grass and weeds had grown there moss had clung to the stones myrtle bushes had taken root and the old rock seemed fixed to the earth 0301 edmond_dantã_s dug away the earth carefully and detected or fancied he detected the ingenious artifice he attacked this wall cemented by the hand of time with his pickaxe after ten minutesâ labor the wall gave way and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened edmond_dantã_s went and cut the strongest olive tree he could find stripped off its branches inserted it in the hole and used it as a lever but the rock was too heavy and too firmly wedged to be moved by anyone man were he hercules himself edmond_dantã_s saw that he must attack the wedge but how he cast his eye around and saw the horn full of powder which his friend jacopo_manfredi had left him he smiled the infernal invention would serve him for this purpose
with the aid of his pickaxe edmond_dantã_s after the manner of a labor saving pioneer dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre he lighted it and retired the explosion soon followed the upper rock was lifted from its base by the terrific force of the powder the lower one flew into pieces thousands of insects escaped from the aperture edmond_dantã_s had previously formed and a huge snake like the guardian demon of the treasure rolled himself along in darkening coils and disappeared edmond_dantã_s approached the upper rock which now without any support leaned towards the sea the intrepid treasure seeker walked round it and selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack placed his lever in one of the crevices and strained every nerve to move the mass the rock already shaken by the explosion tottered on its base edmond_dantã_s redoubled his efforts he seemed like one of the ancient titans who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods the rock yielded rolled over bounded from point to point and finally disappeared in the ocean on the spot it had occupied was a circular space exposing an iron ring let into a square flag stone edmond_dantã_s uttered a cry of joy and surprise never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect success he would fain have continued but his knees trembled and his heart beat so violently and his sight became so dim that he was forced to pause this feeling lasted but for a moment
edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength the flag stone yielded and disclosed step that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous grotto anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy edmond_dantã_s turned pale hesitated and reflected come said he to himself be a man i am accustomed to adversity i must not be cast down by the discovery that i have been deceived what then would be the use of all i have suffered the heart breaks when after having been elated by flattering hopes it sees all its illusions destroyed abbã_faria has dreamed this the cardinal_spada buried no treasure here perhaps he never came here or if he did cã_sar_borgia the intrepid adventurer the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer has followed him discovered his traces pursued them as i have done raised the stone and descending before me has left me nothing he remained motionless and pensive his eye fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his foot now that i expect nothing now that i no longer entertain the slightest hopes the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity and he remained again motionless and thoughtful â_yes yes this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal bandit this fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvels yes cã_sar_borgia has been here a torch in one hand a sword in the other and within twenty paces at the foot of this rock perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea while their master descended as i am about to descend dispelling the darkness before his awe inspiring progress 0303 â but
what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret asked edmond_dantã_s of himself the fate replied he smiling of those who buried alaric and were interred with the corpse â yet had he come thought edmond_dantã_s he would have found the treasure and cã_sar_borgia he who compared italy to an artichoke which he could devour leaf by leaf knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock i will go down then he descended a smile on his lip and murmuring that last word of human philosophy perhaps but instead of the darkness and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find edmond_dantã_s saw a dim and bluish light which as well as the air entered not merely by the aperture he had just formed but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks after having stood a few minute in the cavern the atmosphere of which was rather warm than damp dantã sâ eye habituated as it was to darkness could pierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern which was of granite that sparkled like diamonds alas said edmond_dantã_s smiling these are the treasures the cardinal has left and the good abbã seeing in a dream these glittering wall has indulged in fallacious hopes but he called to mind the word of the will which he knew by heart in the farthest angle of the second opening said the cardinalâ will he had only found the first grotto he had now to seek the second edmond_dantã_s continued his search
he reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island he examined the stones and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed masked for precautionâ sake the pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of dantã sâ forehead large drops of perspiration at last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo he eagerly advanced and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses saw that there in all probability the opening must be however he like cã_sar_borgia knew the value of time and in order to avoid fruitless toil he sounded all the other wall with his pickaxe struck the earth with the butt of his gun and finding nothing that appeared suspicious returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard he again struck it and with greater force then a singular thing occurred as he struck the wall pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off and fell to the ground in flakes exposing a large white stone the aperture of the rock had been closed with stones then this stucco had been applied and painted to imitate granite edmond_dantã_s struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe which entered someway between the interstices it was there he must dig but by some strange play of emotion in proportion as the proofs that abbã_faria had not been deceived became stronger so did his heart give way and a feeling of discouragement stole over him
this last proof instead of giving him fresh strength deprived him of it the pickaxe descended or rather fell he placed it on the ground passed his hand over his brow and remounted the stairs alleging to himself as an excuse a desire to be assured that no one was watching him but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint the island was deserted and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery glance afar off a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue ocean edmond_dantã_s had tasted nothing but he thought not of hunger at such a moment he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum and again entered the cavern the pickaxe that had seemed so heavy was now like a feather in his grasp he seized it and attacked the wall after several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented but had been merely placed one upon the other and covered with stucco he inserted the point of his pickaxe and using the handle as a lever with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on hinges and fall at his foot he had nothing more to do now but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one the aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter but by waiting he could still cling to hope and retard the certainty of deception at last after renewed hesitation edmond_dantã_s entered the second grotto the second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first the air that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell edmond_dantã_s was surprised not to find in the outer cavern
he waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere and then went on at the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle but to dantã sâ eye there was no darkness he glanced around this second grotto it was like the first empty the treasure if it existed was buried in this corner the time had at length arrived two foot of earth removed and dantã sâ fate would be decided he advanced towards the angle and summoning all his resolution attacked the ground with the pickaxe at the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an iron substance never did funeral knell never did alarm bell produce a greater effect on the hearer had edmond_dantã_s found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale he again struck his pickaxe into the earth and encountered the same resistance but not the same sound â_it is a casket of wood bound with iron thought he at this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening edmond_dantã_s seized his gun sprang through the opening and mounted the stair a wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave and was feeding at a little distance this would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner but edmond_dantã_s feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention he thought a moment cut a branch of a resinous tree lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast and descended with this torch he wished to see everything he approached the hole he had dug and now with the aid of the torch saw that his pickaxe had in reality struck against iron and wood he planted his torch in the ground and resumed his labor
in an instant a space three foot long by two foot broad was cleared and edmond_dantã_s could see an oaken coffer bound with cut steel in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate which was still untarnished the arm of the cardinal_spada familyâ viz a sword en pale on an oval shield like all the italian armorial bearings and surmounted by a cardinalâ hat edmond_dantã_s easily recognized them abbã_faria had so often drawn them for him there was no longer any doubt the treasure was thereâ no one would have been at such pains to conceal an empty casket in an instant he had cleared every obstacle away and he saw successively the lock placed between two padlocks and the two handles at each end all carved as thing were carved at that epoch when art rendered the commonest metals precious edmond_dantã_s seized the handles and strove to lift the coffer it was impossible he sought to open it lock and padlock were fastened these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust edmond_dantã_s inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid and pressing with all his force on the handle burst open the fastenings the hinges yielded in their turn and fell still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood and the chest was open 0307 edmond_dantã_s was seized with vertigo he cocked his gun and laid it beside him he then closed his eye as child do in order that they may see in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the firmament then he re opened them and stood motionless with amazement three compartments divided the coffer
in the first blazed piles of golden coin in the second were ranged bars of unpolished gold which possessed nothing attractive save their value in the third edmond_dantã_s grasped handfuls of diamonds pearls and rubies which as they fell on one another sounded like hail against glass after having touched felt examined these treasures edmond_dantã_s rushed through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy he leaped on a rock from whence he could behold the sea he was aloneâ alone with these countless these unheard of treasures was he awake or was it but a dream was it a transient vision or was he face to face with reality he would fain have gazed upon his gold and yet he had not strength enough for an instant he leaned his head in his hand as if to prevent his senses from leaving him and then rushed madly about the rocks of count_of_monte_cristo terrifying the wild goats and scaring the sea fowls with his wild cries and gestures then he returned and still unable to believe the evidence of his senses rushed into the grotto and found himself before this mine of gold and jewels this time he fell on his knees and clasping his hand convulsively uttered a prayer intelligible to god alone he soon became calmer and more happy for only now did he begin to realize his felicity he then set himself to work to count his fortune there were a thousand ingots of gold each weighing from two to three pounds then he piled up twenty five thousand crowns each worth about eighty franc of our money and bearing the effigies of alexander_vi and his predecessors and he saw that the complement was not half empty
and he measured ten double handfuls of pearls diamonds and other gems many of which mounted by the most famous workmen were valuable beyond their intrinsic worth edmond_dantã_s saw the light gradually disappear and fearing to be surprised in the cavern left it his gun in his hand a piece of biscuit and a small quantity of rum formed his supper and he snatched a few hoursâ sleep lying over the mouth of the cave it was a night of joy and terror such as this man of stupendous emotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime chapter 25 the unknown day for which edmond_dantã_s had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open eye again dawned with the first light edmond_dantã_s resumed his search again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape but it wore the same wild barren aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of eve descending into the grotto he lifted the stone filled his pockets with gems put the box together as well and securely as he could sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance then quitting the grotto he replaced the stone heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite filling the interstices with earth into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn then carefully watering these new plantations he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps leaving the approach to the cavern as savage looking and untrodden as he had found it
this done he impatiently awaited the return of his companions to wait at count_of_monte_cristo for the purpose of watching like a dragon over the almost incalculable riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied not the cravings of his heart which yearned to return to dwell among mankind and to assume the rank power and influence which are always accorded to wealthâ that first and greatest of all the forces within the grasp of man on the sixth day the smugglers returned from a distance edmond_dantã_s recognized the rig and handling of la_jeune_amã_lie and dragging himself with affected difficulty towards the landing place he met his companions with an assurance that although considerably better than when they quitted him he still suffered acutely from his late accident he then inquired how they had fared in their trip to this question the smugglers replied that although successful in landing their cargo in safety they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guard ship had just quitted the port of toulon and was crowding all sail towards them this obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy when they could but lament the absence of edmond_dantã_s whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so materially in fact the pursuing vessel had almost overtaken them when fortunately night came on and enabled them to double the cape of corsica and so elude all further pursuit upon the whole however the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned while the crew and particularly jacopo_manfredi expressed great regrets that edmond_dantã_s had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits which amounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each 0311
m edmond_dantã_s preserved the most admirable self command not suffering the faintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island but as la_jeune_amã_lie had merely come to count_of_monte_cristo to fetch him away he embarked that same evening and proceeded with the captain to leghorn arrived at leghorn he repaired to the house_of_peers of a jew a dealer in precious stones to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand franc each edmond_dantã_s half feared that such valuable jewels in the hand of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per cent the following day edmond_dantã_s presented jacopo_manfredi with an entirely new vessel accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his outfit upon condition that he would go at once to marseilles for the purpose of inquiring after an old man named louis_xviii edmond_dantã_s residing in the allã es de meilhan and also a young woman called mercã_dã_s an inhabitant of the catalan village jacopo_manfredi could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present which edmond_dantã_s hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend but that on his arrival at leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune left him by an uncle whose sole heir he was
the superior education of edmond_dantã_s gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to jacopo_manfredi to doubt its accuracy the term for which edmond_dantã_s had engaged to serve on board la_jeune_amã_lie having expired edmond_dantã_s took leave of the captain who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew but having been told the history of the legacy he ceased to importune him further the following morning jacopo_manfredi set sail for marseilles with directions from edmond_dantã_s to join him at the island of count_of_monte_cristo having seen jacopo_manfredi fairly out of the harbor edmond_dantã_s proceeded to make his final adieus on board la_jeune_amã_lie distributing so liberal a gratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all and expression of cordial interest in all that concerned him to the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future plans then edmond_dantã_s departed for genoa at the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay this yacht had been built by order of an englishman who having heard that the genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the mediterranean in the construction of fast sailing vessels was desirous of possessing a specimen of their skill the price agreed upon between the englishman and the genoese builder was forty thousand franc edmond_dantã_s struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel applied to its owner to transfer it to him offering sixty thousand franc upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession
the proposal was too advantageous to be refused the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through switzerland and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another a bargain was therefore struck edmond_dantã_s led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a jew retired with the latter for a few minute to a small back parlor and upon their return the jew counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand franc in bright gold pieces the delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable crew for the little vessel but this edmond_dantã_s declined with many thanks saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone and his principal pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself the only thing the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet in the cabin at his bedâ head the closet to contain three divisions so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself the builder cheerfully undertook the commission and promised to have these secret place completed by the next day edmond_dantã_s furnishing the dimensions and plan in accordance with which they were to be constructed 0313 two hour afterward edmond_dantã_s sailed from the port of genoa under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht but their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which edmond_dantã_s handled the helm
the boat indeed seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence so promptly did it obey the slightest touch and edmond_dantã_s required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to acknowledge that the genoese had not without reason attained their high reputation in the art of shipbuilding the spectators followed the little vessel with their eye as long as it remained visible they then turned their conjectures upon her probable destination some insisted she was making for corsica others the island of elba bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for spain while africa was positively reported by many person as her intended course but no one thought of count_of_monte_cristo yet thither it was that edmond_dantã_s guided his vessel and at count_of_monte_cristo he arrived at the close of the second day his boat had proved herself a first class sailor and had come the distance from genoa in thirty five hour edmond_dantã_s had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore and instead of landing at the usual place he dropped anchor in the little creek the island was utterly deserted and bore no evidence of having been visited since he went away his treasure was just as he had left it early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the secret locker a week passed by edmond_dantã_s employed it in manå uvring his yacht round the island studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined for some important service till at the end of that time he was perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities the former edmond_dantã_s proposed to augment the latter to remedy
upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail approaching count_of_monte_cristo as it drew near he recognized it as the boat he had given to jacopo_manfredi he immediately signalled it his signal was returned and in two hour afterwards the new comer lay at anchor beside the yacht a mournful answer awaited each of edmondâ eager inquiries as to the information jacopo_manfredi had obtained old edmond_dantã_s was dead and mercã_dã_s had disappeared edmond_dantã_s listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness but leaping lightly ashore he signified his desire to be quite alone in a couple of hour he returned two of the man from jacopoâ boat came on board the yacht to assist in navigating it and he gave order that she should be steered direct to marseilles for his fatherâ death he was in some manner prepared but he knew not how to account for the mysterious disappearance of mercã_dã_s without divulging his secret edmond_dantã_s could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent there were besides other particulars he was desirous of ascertaining and those were of a nature he alone could investigate in a manner satisfactory to himself his looking glass had assured him during his stay at leghorn that he ran no risk of recognition moreover he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought proper one fine morning then his yacht followed by the little fishing boat boldly entered the port of marseilles and anchored exactly opposite the spot from whence on the never to be forgotten night of his departure for the chã teau dâ if he had been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither 0315 m
still edmond_dantã_s could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore but with that perfect self possession he had acquired during his acquaintance with abbã_faria edmond_dantã_s coolly presented an english passport he had obtained from leghorn and as this gave him a standing which a french passport would not have afforded he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation the first person to attract the attention of edmond_dantã_s as he landed on the canebiã re was one of the crew belonging to the pharaon edmond_dantã_s welcomed the meeting with this fellowâ who had been one of his own sailorsâ as a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance going straight towards him he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects carefully watching the manâ countenance as he did so but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing giving the sailor a piece of money in return for his civility edmond_dantã_s proceeded onwards but ere he had gone many step he heard the man loudly calling him to stop edmond_dantã_s instantly turned to meet him i beg your pardon sir said the honest fellow in almost breathless haste but i believe you made a mistake you intended to give me a two franc piece and see you gave me a double napoleon â thank you my good friend
i see that i have made a trifling mistake as you say but by way of rewarding your honesty i give you another double napoleon that you may drink to my health and be able to ask your messmates to join you so extreme was the surprise of the sailor that he was unable even to thank edmond_dantã_s whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless astonishment some nabob from india was his comment edmond_dantã_s meanwhile went on his way each step he trod oppressed his heart with fresh emotion his first and most indelible recollections were there not a tree not a street that he passed but seemed filled with dear and cherished memories and thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the rue de noailles from whence a full view of the allã es de meilhan was obtained at this spot so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances his heart beat almost to bursting his knees tottered under him a mist floated over his sight and had he not clung for support to one of the trees he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there recovering himself however he wiped the perspiration from his brows and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house_of_peers in which his father had lived the nasturtiums and other plants which his father had delighted to train before his window had all disappeared from the upper part of the house_of_peers leaning against the tree he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper stories of the shabby little house_of_peers then he advanced to the door and asked whether there were any room to be let
though answered in the negative he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor that in despite of the oft repeated assurance of the concierge that they were occupied edmond_dantã_s succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them the tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week and seeing them edmond_dantã_s sighed heavily nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder edmond_dantã_s the very paper was different while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the room had been filled in edmondâ time had all disappeared the four wall alone remained as he had left them the bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his and in spite of his efforts to prevent it the eye of edmond_dantã_s were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last vainly calling for his son the young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitorâ emotion and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features but they felt the sacredness of his grief and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause while with instinctive delicacy they left him to indulge his sorrow alone 0317m when he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections they both accompanied him downstairs reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to him
as edmond_dantã_s passed the door on the fourth floor he paused to inquire whether m_caderousse the tailor still dwelt there but he received for reply that the person in question had got into difficulties and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from bellegarde to beaucaire having obtained the address of the person to whom the house_of_peers in the allã es de meilhan belonged edmond_dantã_s next proceeded thither and under the name of lord_wilmore the name and title inscribed on his passport purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twenty five thousand franc at least ten thousand more than it was worth but had its owner asked half a million it would unhesitatingly have been given the very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house_of_peers now become the property of edmond_dantã_s were duly informed by the notary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds etc that the new landlord gave them their choice of any of the room in the house_of_peers without the least augmentation of rent upon condition of their giving instant possession of the two small chambers they at present inhabited this strange event aroused great wonder and curiosity in the neighborhood of the allã es de meilhan and a multitude of theories were afloat none of which was anywhere near the truth
but what raised public astonishment to a climax and set all conjecture at defiance was the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the allã es de meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the little village of the catalans and afterwards observed to enter a poor fishermanâ hut and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after person who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen year but on the following day the family from whom all these particulars had been asked received a handsome present consisting of an entirely new fishing boat with two seines and a tender the delighted recipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have poured out their thanks to their generous benefactor but they had seen him upon quitting the hut merely give some order to a sailor and then springing lightly on horseback leave marseilles by the porte dâ aix chapter 26 the pont du gard inn such of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of france may perchance have noticed about midway between the town of beaucaire and the village of bellegarde a little nearer to the former than to the latter a small roadside inn from the front of which hung creaking and flapping in the wind a sheet of tin covered with a grotesque representation of the pont du gard this modern place of entertainment stood on the left hand side of the post road and backed upon the rhã ne it also boasted of what in languedoc is styled a garden consisting of a small plot of ground on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests
a few dingy olives and stunted fig trees struggled hard for existence but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic tomatoes and eschalots while lone and solitary like a forgotten sentinel a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot and displayed its flexible stem and fan shaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the sub tropical sun all these trees great or small were turned in the direction to which the mistral blows one of the three curses of provence the others being the durance and the parliament in the surrounding plain which more resembled a dusty lake than solid ground were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat the effect no doubt of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those parched regions was practicable each stalk served as a perch for a grasshopper which regaled the passers by through this egyptian scene with its strident monotonous note for about seven or eight year the little tavern had been kept by a man and his wife with two servant a chambermaid named trinette and a hostler called pecaud this small staff was quite equal to all the requirements for a canal between beaucaire and aiguemortes had revolutionized transportation by substituting boats for the cart and the stagecoach
and as though to add to the daily misery which this prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper whose utter ruin it was fast accomplishing it was situated between the rhã ne from which it had its source and the post road it had depleted not a hundred step from the inn of which we have given a brief but faithful description the innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty five year of age tall strong and bony a perfect specimen of the natives of those southern latitudes he had dark sparkling and deep set eye hooked nose and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal his hair like his beard which he wore under his chin was thick and curly and in spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads his naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door on the lookout for guests who seldom came yet there he stood day after day exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it after the manner of the spanish muleteers this man was our old acquaintance gaspard_caderousse m_caderousse his wife on the contrary whose maiden name had been madeleine radelle was pale meagre and sickly looking born in the neighborhood of arles she had shared in the beauty for which its woman are proverbial but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of aiguemortes and the marshes of camargue
she remained nearly always in her second floor chamber shivering in her chair or stretched languid and feeble on her bed while her husband kept his daily watch at the doorâ a duty he performed with so much the greater willingness as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply in these philosophic word hush la_carconte it is godâ pleasure that thing should be so the sobriquet of la_carconte had been bestowed on madeleine radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village so called situated between salon and lambesc and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of france where m_caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation her husband had bestowed on her the name of la_carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of madeleine which in all probability his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce still let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of providence the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits and the daily infliction of his peevish partnerâ murmurs and lamentations 0323 like other dwellers in the south he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires but fond of external show vain and addicted to display during the day of his prosperity not a festivity took place without himself and wife being among the spectators
he dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of france bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the catalans and andalusians while la_carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the woman of arles a mode of attire borrowed equally from greece and arabia but by degrees watch chains necklaces parti colored scarves embroidered bodices velvet vests elegantly worked stockings striped gaiters and silver buckles for the shoes all disappeared and gaspard_caderousse m_caderousse unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities both for himself and wife although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung more for the shelter than the profit it afforded m_caderousse then was as usual at his place of observation before the door his eye glancing listlessly from a piece of closely shaven grassâ on which some fowls were industriously though fruitlessly endeavoring to turn up some grain or insect suited to their palateâ to the deserted road which led away to the north and south when he was aroused by the shrill voice of his wife and grumbling to himself as he went he mounted to her chamber first taking care however to set the entrance door wide open as an invitation to any chance traveller who might be passing at the moment m_caderousse quitted his sentry like watch before the door the road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and lonely as a desert at midday
there it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand with its side bordered by tall meagre trees altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller at liberty to regulate his hour for journeying would choose to expose himself in such a formidable sahara nevertheless had m_caderousse but retained his post a few minute longer he might have caught a dim outline of something approaching from the direction of bellegarde as the moving object drew nearer he would easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse between whom the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared to exist the horse was of hungarian breed and ambled along at an easy pace his rider was a priest dressed in black and wearing a three cornered hat and spite of the ardent rays of a noonday sun the pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity having arrived before the pont du gard the horse stopped but whether for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to say however that might have been the priest dismounting led his steed by the bridle in search of some place to which he could secure him availing himself of a handle that projected from a half fallen door he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red cotton handkerchief from his pocket wiped away the perspiration that streamed from his brow then advancing to the door struck thrice with the end of his iron shod stick
at this unusual sound a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society at that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor and with many bows and courteous smile the host of the pont du gard besought his guest to enter 0319 â you are welcome sir most welcome repeated the astonished m_caderousse now then margotin cried he speaking to the dog will you be quiet pray donâ heed him sir he only barks he never bites i make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain m_caderousse hastily exclaimed a thousand pardons i really did not observe whom i had the honor to receive under my poor roof what would the abbã please to have what refreshment can i offer all i have is at his service the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gazeâ there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with a strong italian accent you are i presume
m m_caderousse â_yes sir answered the host even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it i am gaspard_caderousse m_caderousse at your service â gaspard_caderousse m_caderousse rejoined the priest â_yes christian and surname are the same you formerly lived i believe in the allã es de meilhan on the fourth floor 0325m i did â and you followed the business of a tailor â true i was a tailor till the trade fell off it is so hot at marseilles that really i believe that the respectable inhabitants will in time go without any clothing whatever but talking of heat is there nothing i can offer you by way of refreshment â_yes let me have a bottle of your best wine and then with your permission we will resume our conversation from where we left off â as you please sir said m_caderousse who anxious not to lose the present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of cahors still remaining in his possession hastily raised a trap door in the floor of the apartment they were in which served both as parlor and kitchen upon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the expiration of five minute he found the abbã seated upon a wooden stool leaning his elbow on a table while margotin whose animosity seemed appeased by the unusual command of the traveller for refreshments had crept up to him and had established himself very comfortably between his knees his long skinny neck resting on his lap while his dim eye was fixed earnestly on the travellerâ face are you quite alone inquired the guest as m_caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass
â quite quite alone replied the manâ or at least practically so for my poor wife who is the only person in the house_of_peers besides myself is laid up with illness and unable to render me the least assistance poor thing â you are married then said the priest with a show of interest glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment ah sir said m_caderousse with a sigh â_it is easy to perceive i am not a rich man but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest the abbã fixed on him a searching penetrating glance â_yes honestâ i can certainly say that much for myself continued the innkeeper fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbã s gaze i can boast with truth of being an honest man and continued he significantly with a hand on his breast and shaking his head that is more than everyone can say nowadays 0327m so much the better for you if what you assert be true said the abbã for i am firmly persuaded that sooner or later the good will be rewarded and the wicked punished â such word as those belong to your profession answered m_caderousse and you do well to repeat them but added he with a bitter expression of countenance one is free to believe them or not as one pleases â you are wrong to speak thus said the abbã and perhaps i may in my own person be able to prove to you how completely you are in error â what mean you inquired m_caderousse with a look of surprise in the first place i must be satisfied that you are the person i am in search of â what proofs do you require
â did you in the year 1814 or 1815 know anything of a young sailor named edmond_dantã_s â edmond_dantã_s did i know poor dear edmond_dantã_s why edmond_dantã_s and myself were intimate friend exclaimed m_caderousse whose countenance flushed darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbã fixed on him while the clear calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny you remind me said the priest that the young man concerning whom i asked you was said to bear the name of edmond_dantã_s â said to bear the name repeated m_caderousse becoming excited and eager why he was so called as truly as i myself bore the appellation of gaspard_caderousse m_caderousse but tell me i pray what has become of poor edmond_dantã_s did you know him is he alive and at liberty is he prosperous and happy â he died a more wretched hopeless heart broken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of toulon a deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of m_caderousse who turned away and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eye with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head poor fellow poor fellow murmured m_caderousse well there sir is another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth and that none but the wicked prosper ah continued m_caderousse speaking in the highly colored language of the south the world grows worse and worse why does not god if he really hates the wicked as he is said to do send down brimstone and fire and consume them altogether â you speak as though you had loved this young edmond_dantã_s observed the abbã without taking any notice of his companionâ vehemence and so i did
replied m_caderousse though once i confess i envied him his good fortune but i swear to you sir i swear to you by everything a man holds dear i have since then deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate there was a brief silence during which the fixed searching eye of the abbã was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper you knew the poor lad then continued m_caderousse i was called to see him on his dying bed that i might administer to him the consolations of religion â and of what did he die asked m_caderousse in a choking voice of what think you do young and strong man die in prison when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year unless it be of imprisonment m_caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his brow 0329m but the strangest part of the story is resumed the abbã that edmond_dantã_s even in his dying moment swore by his crucified redeemer that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention â and so he was murmured m_caderousse how should he have been otherwise ah sir the poor fellow told you the truth â and for that reason he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it and here the look of the abbã becoming more and more fixed seemed to rest with ill concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of m_caderousse
â a rich englishman continued the abbã who had been his companion in misfortune but had been released from prison during the second restoration was possessed of a diamond of immense value this jewel he bestowed on edmond_dantã_s upon himself quitting the prison as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which edmond_dantã_s had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor edmond_dantã_s carefully preserved it that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune â then i suppose asked m_caderousse with eager glowing look that it was a stone of immense value â why everything is relative answered the abbã to one in edmondâ position the diamond certainly was of great value it was estimated at fifty thousand franc â bless me exclaimed m_caderousse fifty thousand franc surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that â no replied the abbã â_it was not of such a size as that but you shall judge for yourself i have it with me the sharp gaze of m_caderousse was instantly directed towards the priestâ garments as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen the abbã opened it and displayed to the dazzled eye of m_caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained set in a ring of admirable workmanship and
that diamond cried m_caderousse almost breathless with eager admiration you say is worth fifty thousand franc â_it is without the setting which is also valuable replied the abbã as he closed the box and returned it to his pocket while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eye of the fascinated innkeeper but how comes the diamond in your possession sir did edmond_dantã_s make you his heir â no merely his testamentary executor i once possessed four dear and faithful friend besides the maiden to whom i was betrothedâ he said and i feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss the name of one of the four friend is m_caderousse â the innkeeper shivered â another of the number â continued the abbã without seeming to notice the emotion of m_caderousse â is called mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and the third in spite of being my rival entertained a very sincere affection for me â a fiendish smile played over the features of m_caderousse who was about to break in upon the abbã s speech when the latter waving his hand said allow me to finish first and then if you have any observations to make you can do so afterwards the third of my friend although my rival was much attached to me his name was m_fernand_mondego that of my betrothed wasâ stay stay continued the abbã i have forgotten what he called her â mercã_dã_s said m_caderousse eagerly true said the abbã with a stifled sigh mercã_dã_s it was â go on urged m_caderousse bring me a carafe of water said the abbã m_caderousse quickly performed the strangerâ bidding and after pouring some into a glass and slowly swallowing its contents the abbã resuming his usual placidity of manner said as he placed his empty glass on the table where did we leave off
â the name of edmondâ betrothed was mercã_dã_s â to be sure you will go to marseilles said edmond_dantã_s for you understand i repeat his word just as he uttered them do you understand â perfectly â you will sell this diamond you will divide the money into five equal part and give an equal portion to these good friend the only person who have loved me upon earth â but why into five part asked m_caderousse you only mentioned four person â because the fifth is dead as i hear the fifth sharer in edmondâ bequest was his own father â too true too true ejaculated m_caderousse almost suffocated by the contending passions which assailed him the poor old man did die â i learned so much at marseilles replied the abbã making a strong effort to appear indifferent but from the length of time that has elapsed since the death of the elder edmond_dantã_s i was unable to obtain any particulars of his end can you enlighten me on that point â i do not know who could if i could not said m_caderousse why i lived almost on the same floor with the poor old man ah yes about a year after the disappearance of his son the poor old man died â of what did he die â why the doctors called his complaint gastro enteritis i believe his acquaintances say he died of grief but i who saw him in his dying moment i say he died ofâ â m_caderousse paused of what asked the priest anxiously and eagerly why of downright starvation â starvation exclaimed the abbã springing from his seat why the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that
the very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread and that a man a christian should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other man who call themselves christians is too horrible for belief oh it is impossible utterly impossible â what i have said i have said answered m_caderousse and you are a fool for having said anything about it said a voice from the top of the stairs why should you meddle with what does not concern you the two man turned quickly and saw the sickly countenance of la_carconte peering between the baluster rails attracted by the sound of voice she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs and seated on the lower step head on knees she had listened to the foregoing conversation mind your own business wife replied m_caderousse sharply this gentleman asks me for information which common politeness will not permit me to refuse â politeness you simpleton retorted la_carconte what have you to do with politeness i should like to know better study a little common prudence how do you know the motives that person may have for trying to extract all he can from you â i pledge you my word madam said the abbã that my intentions are good and that your husband can incur no risk provided he answers me candidly â ah thatâ all very fine retorted the woman
â nothing is easier than to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear but when poor silly folks like my husband there have been persuaded to tell all they know the promises and assurances of safety are quickly forgotten and at some moment when nobody is expecting it behold trouble and misery and all sorts of persecutions are heaped on the unfortunate wretches who cannot even see whence all their afflictions come â nay nay my good woman make yourself perfectly easy i beg of you whatever evils may befall you they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality that i solemnly promise you la_carconte muttered a few inarticulate word then let her head again drop upon her knees and went into a fit of ague leaving the two speakers to resume the conversation but remaining so as to be able to hear every word they uttered again the abbã had been obliged to swallow a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower him when he had sufficiently recovered himself he said â_it appears then that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by everyone surely had not such been the case he would not have perished by so dreadful a death â why he was not altogether forsaken continued m_caderousse for mercã_dã_s the catalan and monsieur_albert m_maximilian_morrel were very kind to him but somehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for fernandâ the very person added m_caderousse with a bitter smile that you named just now as being one of dantã sâ faithful and attached friend â and was he not so asked the abbã gaspard_caderousse gaspard murmured the woman from her seat on the stairs mind what you are saying
caderousse made no reply to these word though evidently irritated and annoyed by the interruption but addressing the abbã said can a man be faithful to another whose wife he covets and desires for himself but edmond_dantã_s was so honorable and true in his own nature that he believed everybodyâ professions of friendship poor edmond_dantã_s he was cruelly deceived but it was fortunate that he never knew or he might have found it more difficult when on his deathbed to pardon his enemies and whatever people may say continued m_caderousse in his native language which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry i cannot help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the living â imbecile exclaimed la_carconte do you then know in what manner m_fernand_mondego injured edmond_dantã_s inquired the abbã of m_caderousse do i no one better â speak out then say what it was â gaspard_caderousse cried la_carconte do as you will you are masterâ but if you take my advice youâ ll hold your tongue â well wife replied m_caderousse i donâ know but what youâ re right â so you will say nothing asked the abbã why what good would it do asked m_caderousse if the poor lad were living and came to me and begged that i would candidly tell which were his true and which his false friend why perhaps i should not hesitate but you tell me he is no more and therefore can have nothing to do with hatred or revenge so let all such feeling be buried with him â you prefer then said the abbã that i should bestow on man you say are false and treacherous the reward intended for faithful friendship â that is true enough returned m_caderousse
â you say truly the gift of poor edmond_dantã_s was not meant for such traitors as m_fernand_mondego and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars besides what would it be to them no more than a drop of water in the ocean â remember chimed in la_carconte those two could crush you at a single blow â how so inquired the abbã are these person then so rich and powerful â do you not know their history â i do not pray relate it to me m_caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moment then said no truly it would take up too much time â well my good friend returned the abbã in a tone that indicated utter indifference on his part you are at liberty either to speak or be silent just as you please for my own part i respect your scruples and admire your sentiments so let the matter end i shall do my duty as conscientiously as i can and fulfil my promise to the dying man my first business will be to dispose of this diamond so saying the abbã again drew the small box from his pocket opened it and contrived to hold it in such a light that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of m_caderousse wife wife cried he in a hoarse voice come here â diamond exclaimed la_carconte rising and descending to the chamber with a tolerably firm step what diamond are you talking about â why did you not hear all we said inquired m_caderousse â_it is a beautiful diamond left by poor edmond_dantã_s to be sold and the money divided between his father mercã_dã_s his betrothed bride m_fernand_mondego mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and myself the jewel is worth at least fifty thousand franc â_oh what a magnificent jewel cried the astonished woman
â the fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then does it not asked m_caderousse â_it does replied the abbã with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder edmond_dantã_s which i believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four survivors â and why among us four inquired m_caderousse as being the friend edmond_dantã_s esteemed most faithful and devoted to him â i donâ call those friend who betray and ruin you murmured the wife in her turn in a low muttering voice of course not rejoined m_caderousse quickly no more do i and that was what i was observing to this gentleman just now i said i looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery perhaps crime â remember answered the abbã calmly as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock â_it is your fault not mine that i do so you will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both m_fernand_mondego and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars in order that i may execute edmondâ last wishes the agitation of m_caderousse became extreme and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated brow as he saw the abbã rise from his seat and go towards the door as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey m_caderousse and his wife exchanged look of deep meaning 0335 â there you see wife said the former this splendid diamond might all be ours if we chose â do you believe it â why surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us â well replied la_carconte do as you like for my part i wash my hand of the affair
so saying she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber her body convulsed with chills and her teeth rattling in her head in spite of the intense heat of the weather arrived at the top stair she turned round and called out in a warning tone to her husband gaspard_caderousse consider well what you are about to do â i have both reflected and decided answered he la_carconte then entered her chamber the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy uncertain tread as she proceeded towards her armchair into which she fell as though exhausted well asked the abbã as he returned to the apartment below what have you made up your mind to do â to tell you all i know was the reply i certainly think you act wisely in so doing said the priest not because i have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me but simply that if through your assistance i could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator why so much the better that is all â i hope it may be so replied m_caderousse his face flushed with cupidity i am all attention said the abbã stop a minute answered m_caderousse we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story which would be a pity and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves with these word he went stealthily to the door which he closed and by way of still greater precaution bolted and barred it as he was accustomed to do at night during this time the abbã had chosen his place for listening at his ease
he removed his seat into a corner of the room where he himself would be in deep shadow while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator then with head bent down and hand clasped or rather clenched together he prepared to give his whole attention to m_caderousse who seated himself on the little stool exactly opposite to him remember this is no affair of mine said the trembling voice of la_carconte as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting below enough enough replied m_caderousse say no more about it i will take all the consequences upon myself and he began his story chapter 27 the story first sir said m_caderousse you must make me a promise â what is that inquired the abbã why if you ever make use of the details i am about to give you that you will never let anyone know that it was i who supplied them for the person of whom i am about to talk are rich and powerful and if they only laid the tips of their fingers on me i should break to pieces like glass â make yourself easy my friend replied the abbã i am a priest and confessions die in my breast recollect our only desire is to carry out in a fitting manner the last wishes of our friend speak then without reserve as without hatred tell the truth the whole truth i do not know never may know the person of whom you are about to speak besides i am an italian and not a frenchman and belong to god and not to man and i shall shortly retire to my convent which i have only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man
this positive assurance seemed to give m_caderousse a little courage well then under these circumstances said m_caderousse i will i even believe i ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor edmond_dantã_s thought so sincere and unquestionable â begin with his father if you please said the abbã edmond_dantã_s talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love â the history is a sad one sir said m_caderousse shaking his head perhaps you know all the earlier part of it â_yes answered the abbã edmond_dantã_s related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to marseilles â at la rã serve oh yes i can see it all before me this moment â was it not his betrothal feast â_it was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending a police commissary followed by four soldiers entered and edmond_dantã_s was arrested â_yes and up to this point i know all said the priest edmond_dantã_s himself only knew that which personally concerned him for he never beheld again the five person i have named to you or heard mention of anyone of them â well when edmond_dantã_s was arrested monsieur_albert m_maximilian_morrel hastened to obtain the particulars and they were very sad the old man returned alone to his home folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eye and paced up and down his chamber the whole day and would not go to bed at all for i was underneath him and heard him walking the whole night and for myself i assure you
i could not sleep either for the grief of the poor father gave me great uneasiness and every step he took went to my heart as really as if his foot had pressed against my breast the next day mercã_dã_s came to implore the protection of m_noirtier_de_villefort she did not obtain it however and went to visit the old man when she saw him so miserable and heart broken having passed a sleepless night and not touched food since the previous day she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him but the old man would not consent no was the old manâ reply i will not leave this house_of_peers for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the world and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing and what would he think if i did not wait here for him i heard all this from the window for i was anxious that mercã_dã_s should persuade the old man to accompany her for his footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a momentâ repose â but did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man asked the abbã ah sir replied m_caderousse we cannot console those who will not be consoled and he was one of these besides i know not why but he seemed to dislike seeing me one night however i heard his sobs and i could not resist my desire to go up to him but when i reached his door he was no longer weeping but praying i cannot now repeat to you sir all the eloquent word and imploring language he made use of
it was more than piety it was more than grief and i who am no canter and hate the jesuits said then to myself â_it is really well and i am very glad that i have not any child for if i were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying i should throw myself into the sea at once for i could not bear it â poor father murmured the priest from day to day he lived on alone and more and more solitary m_maximilian_morrel and mercã_dã_s came to see him but his door was closed and although i was certain he was at home he would not make any answer one day when contrary to his custom he had admitted mercã_dã_s and the poor girl in spite of her own grief and despair endeavored to console him he said to her â be assured my dear daughter he is dead and instead of expecting him it is he who is awaiting us i am quite happy for i am the oldest and of course shall see him first â however well disposed a person may be why you see we leave off after a time seeing person who are in sorrow they make one melancholy and so at last old edmond_dantã_s was left all to himself and i only saw from time to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to hide but i guessed what these bundles were and that he sold by degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence
at length the poor old fellow reached the end of all he had he owed three quartersâ rent and they threatened to turn him out he begged for another week which was granted to him i know this because the landlord came into my apartment when he left his for the first three day i heard him walking about as usual but on the fourth i heard nothing i then resolved to go up to him at all risks the door was closed but i looked through the keyhole and saw him so pale and haggard that believing him very ill i went and told m_maximilian_morrel and then ran on to mercã_dã_s they both came immediately m_maximilian_morrel bringing a doctor and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels and ordered him a limited diet i was there too and i never shall forget the old manâ smile at this prescription from that time he received all who came he had an excuse for not eating any more the doctor had put him on a diet the abbã uttered a kind of groan the story interests you does it not sir inquired m_caderousse â_yes replied the abbã â_it is very affecting â mercã_dã_s came again and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home this was morrelâ wish also who would fain have conveyed the old man against his consent but the old man resisted and cried so that they were actually frightened
mercã dã remained therefore by his bedside and m_maximilian_morrel went away making a sign to the catalan that he had left his purse on the chimney piece but availing himself of the doctorâ order the old man would not take any sustenance at length after nine day of despair and fasting the old man died cursing those who had caused his misery and saying to mercã_dã_s if you ever see my edmond_dantã_s again tell him i die blessing him â the abbã rose from his chair made two turns round the chamber and pressed his trembling hand against his parched throat and you believe he diedâ â of hunger sir of hunger said m_caderousse i am as certain of it as that we two are christians the abbã with a shaking hand seized a glass of water that was standing by him half full swallowed it at one gulp and then resumed his seat with red eye and pale cheeks this was indeed a horrid event said he in a hoarse voice the more so sir as it was menâ and not godâ doing â tell me of those man said the abbã and remember too he added in an almost menacing tone you have promised to tell me everything tell me therefore who are these man who killed the son with despair and the father with famine â two man jealous of him sir one from love and the other from ambition m_fernand_mondego and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â how was this jealousy manifested speak on â they denounced edmond_dantã_s as a bonapartist agent â which of the two denounced him which was the real delinquent â both sir one with a letter and the other put it in the post â and where was this letter written â at la rã serve the day before the betrothal feast â twas so
thenâ twas so then murmured the abbã â_oh abbã_faria faria how well did you judge man and thing â what did you please to say sir asked m_caderousse nothing nothing replied the priest go on â_it was mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand that his writing might not be recognized and m_fernand_mondego who put it in the post â but exclaimed the abbã suddenly you were there yourself â i said m_caderousse astonished who told you i was there the abbã saw he had overshot the mark and he added quickly â no one but in order to have known everything so well you must have been an eye witness â true true said m_caderousse in a choking voice i was there â and did you not remonstrate against such infamy asked the abbã if not you were an accomplice â sir replied m_caderousse they had made me drink to such an excess that i nearly lost all perception i had only an indistinct understanding of what was passing around me i said all that a man in such a state could say but they both assured me that it was a jest they were carrying on and perfectly harmless â next dayâ next day sir you must have seen plain enough what they had been doing yet you said nothing though you were present when edmond_dantã_s was arrested â_yes sir i was there and very anxious to speak but mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars restrained me if he should really be guilty said he and did really put in to the island of elba if he is really charged with a letter for the bonapartist committee at paris and if they find this letter upon him those who have supported him will pass for his accomplices
i confess i had my fears in the state in which politics then were and i held my tongue it was cowardly i confess but it was not criminal 0341m i understandâ you allowed matters to take their course that was all â_yes sir answered m_caderousse and remorse preys on me night and day i often ask pardon of god i swear to you because this action the only one with which i have seriously to reproach myself in all my life is no doubt the cause of my abject condition i am expiating a moment of selfishness and so i always say to la_carconte when she complains hold your tongue woman it is the will of god â and m_caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real repentance well sir said the abbã you have spoken unreservedly and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve pardon â unfortunately edmond_dantã_s is dead and has not pardoned me â he did not know said the abbã but he knows it all now interrupted m_caderousse they say the dead know everything there was a brief silence the abbã rose and paced up and down pensively and then resumed his seat you have two or three time mentioned a m_maximilian_morrel he said who was he â the owner of the pharaon and patron of edmond_dantã_s â and what part did he play in this sad drama inquired the abbã the part of an honest man full of courage and real regard twenty time he interceded for edmond_dantã_s when the emperor returned he wrote implored threatened and so energetically that on the second restoration he was persecuted as a bonapartist
ten time as i told you he came to see dantã sâ father and offered to receive him in his own house_of_peers and the night or two before his death as i have already said he left his purse on the mantelpiece with which they paid the old manâ debts and buried him decently and so edmondâ father died as he had lived without doing harm to anyone i have the purse still by meâ a large one made of red silk â and asked the abbã is m_maximilian_morrel still alive â_yes replied m_caderousse in that case replied the abbã he should be a man blessed of god rich happy m_caderousse smiled bitterly â_yes happy as myself said he what m_maximilian_morrel unhappy exclaimed the abbã he is reduced almost to the last extremityâ nay he is almost at the point of dishonor â how â_yes continued m_caderousse so it is after five and twenty year of labor after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of marseilles m_maximilian_morrel is utterly ruined he has lost five ships in two year has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large house and his only hope now is in that very pharaon which poor edmond_dantã_s commanded and which is expected from the indies with a cargo of cochineal and indigo if this ship founders like the others he is a ruined man â and has the unfortunate man wife or child inquired the abbã â_yes he has a wife who through everything has behaved like an angel he has a daughter who was about to marry the man she loved but whose family now will not allow him to
wed the daughter of a ruined man he has besides a son a lieutenant in the army and as you may suppose all this instead of lessening only augments his sorrows if he were alone in the world he would blow out his brains and there would be an end â horrible ejaculated the priest and it is thus heaven recompenses virtue sir added m_caderousse you see i who never did a bad action but that i have told you ofâ am in destitution with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eye and i unable to do anything in the world for her i shall die of hunger as old edmond_dantã_s did while m_fernand_mondego and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars are rolling in wealth â how is that â because their deeds have brought them good fortune while honest man have been reduced to misery â what has become of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars the instigator and therefore the most guilty â what has become of him why he left marseilles and was taken on the recommendation of m_maximilian_morrel who did not know his crime as cashier into a spanish bank during the war with spain he was employed in the commissariat of the french army and made a fortune then with that money he speculated in the funds and trebled or quadrupled his capital and having first married his bankerâ daughter who left him a widower he has married a second time a widow a madame de nargonne daughter of de servieux the kingâ chamberlain who is in high favor at court he is a millionaire and they have made him a baron and now he is the baron mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with a fine residence in the rue du mont blanc with ten horse in his stables six footmen in his antechamber and
i know not how many millions in his strongbox â ah said the abbã in a peculiar tone he is happy â happy who can answer for that happiness or unhappiness is the secret known but to oneâ self and the wallsâ wall have ears but no tongue but if a large fortune produces happiness mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is happy â and m_fernand_mondego â m_fernand_mondego why much the same story â but how could a poor catalan fisher boy without education or resources make a fortune i confess this staggers me â and it has staggered everybody there must have been in his life some strange secret that no one knows â but then by what visible step has he attained this high fortune or high position â both sirâ he has both fortune and positionâ both â this must be impossible â_it would seem so but listen and you will understand some day before the return of the emperor m_fernand_mondego was drafted the bourbons left him quietly enough at the catalans but napoleon returned a special levy was made and m_fernand_mondego was compelled to join i went too but as i was older than m_fernand_mondego and had just married my poor wife i was only sent to the coast m_fernand_mondego was enrolled in the active army went to the frontier with his regiment and was at the battle of ligny the night after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who carried on a secret correspondence with the enemy that same night the general was to go over to the english he proposed to m_fernand_mondego to accompany him m_fernand_mondego agreed to do so deserted his post and followed the general m_fernand_mondego would have been court martialed if napoleon had remained on the throne but his action was rewarded by the bourbons
he returned to france with the epaulet of sub lieutenant and as the protection of the general who is in the highest favor was accorded to him he was a captain in 1823 during the spanish warâ that is to say at the time when mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars made his early speculations m_fernand_mondego was a spaniard and being sent to spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow countrymen found mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars there got on very intimate terms with him won over the support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces received promises and made pledges on his own part guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists and in fact rendered such services in this brief campaign that after the taking of trocadero he was made colonel and received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the legion of honor â destiny destiny murmured the abbã â_yes but listen this was not all the war with spain being ended fernandâ career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to endure throughout europe greece only had risen against turkey and had begun her war of independence all eye were turned towards athensâ it was the fashion to pity and support the greeks the french government without protecting them openly as you know gave countenance to volunteer assistance m_fernand_mondego sought and obtained leave to go and serve in greece still having his name kept on the army roll 0345 some time after it was stated that the comte de viscount_albert_de_morcerf this was the name he bore had entered the service of ali_pasha_of_yanina with the rank of instructor general
ali pasha was killed as you know but before he died he recompensed the services of m_fernand_mondego by leaving him a considerable sum with which he returned to france when he was gazetted lieutenant general â so that nowâ â inquired the abbã so that now continued m_caderousse he owns a magnificent houseâ no 27 rue du helder paris the abbã opened his mouth hesitated for a moment then making an effort at self control he said and mercã dã sâ they tell me that she has disappeared â disappeared said m_caderousse â_yes as the sun disappears to rise the next day with still more splendor â has she made a fortune also inquired the abbã with an ironical smile mercã_dã_s is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in paris replied m_caderousse go on said the abbã â_it seems as if i were listening to the story of a dream but i have seen thing so extraordinary that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might â mercã_dã_s was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived her of edmond_dantã_s i have told you of her attempts to propitiate m_noirtier_de_villefort her devotion to the elder edmond_dantã_s in the midst of her despair a new affliction overtook her this was the departure of fernandâ of m_fernand_mondego whose crime she did not know and whom she regarded as her brother m_fernand_mondego went and mercã_dã_s remained alone three month passed and still she weptâ no news of edmond_dantã_s no news of m_fernand_mondego no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with despair one evening after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to marseilles from the catalans she returned to her home more depressed than ever
suddenly she heard a step she knew turned anxiously around the door opened and m_fernand_mondego dressed in the uniform of a sub lieutenant stood before her â_it was not the one she wished for most but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her mercã_dã_s seized fernandâ hand with a transport which he took for love but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world and seeing at last a friend after long hour of solitary sorrow and then it must be confessed m_fernand_mondego had never been hatedâ he was only not precisely loved another possessed all mercã dã sâ heart that other was absent had disappeared perhaps was dead at this last thought mercã_dã_s burst into a flood of tears and wrung her hand in agony but the thought which she had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another came now in full force upon her mind and then too old edmond_dantã_s incessantly said to her our edmond_dantã_s is dead if he were not he would return to us â the old man died as i have told you had he lived mercã_dã_s perchance had not become the wife of another for he would have been there to reproach her infidelity m_fernand_mondego saw this and when he learned of the old manâ death he returned he was now a lieutenant at his first coming he had not said a word of love to mercã_dã_s at the second he reminded her that he loved her mercã_dã_s begged for six month more in which to await and mourn for edmond_dantã_s â so that said the abbã with a bitter smile that makes eighteen month in all what more could the most devoted lover desire
then he murmured the word of the english poet â frailty thy name is woman â six month afterwards continued m_caderousse the marriage took place in the church of accoules â the very church in which she was to have married edmond_dantã_s murmured the priest there was only a change of bridegrooms â well mercã_dã_s was married proceeded m_caderousse but although in the eye of the world she appeared calm she nearly fainted as she passed la rã serve where eighteen month before the betrothal had been celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved had she looked to the bottom of her heart m_fernand_mondego more happy but not more at his easeâ for i saw at this time he was in constant dread of edmondâ returnâ m_fernand_mondego was very anxious to get his wife away and to depart himself there were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the catalans and eight day after the wedding they left marseilles â did you ever see mercã_dã_s again inquired the priest â_yes during the spanish war at perpignan where m_fernand_mondego had left her she was attending to the education of her son the abbã started her son said he â_yes replied m_caderousse little monsieur_albert â but then to be able to instruct her child continued the abbã she must have received an education herself i understood from edmond_dantã_s that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman beautiful but uneducated â_oh replied m_caderousse did he know so little of his lovely betrothed mercã_dã_s might have been a queen sir if the crown were to be placed on the head of the loveliest and most intelligent fernandâ fortune was already waxing great and she developed with his growing fortune she learned drawing musicâ everything
besides i believe between ourselves she did this in order to distract her mind that she might forget and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart but now her position in life is assured continued m_caderousse no doubt fortune and honor have comforted her she is rich a countess and yetâ â m_caderousse paused and yet what asked the abbã yet i am sure she is not happy said m_caderousse what makes you believe this â why when i found myself utterly destitute i thought my old friend would perhaps assist me so i went to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who would not even receive me i called on m_fernand_mondego who sent me a hundred franc by his valet de chambre â then you did not see either of them â no but madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf saw me â how was that â as i went away a purse fell at my feetâ it contained five and twenty louis_xviii i raised my head quickly and saw mercã_dã_s who at once shut the blind â and m_noirtier_de_villefort asked the abbã â_oh he never was a friend of mine i did not know him and i had nothing to ask of him â do you not know what became of him and the share he had in edmondâ misfortunes â no i only know that some time after edmondâ arrest he married mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars de madame_de_saint_mã_ran and soon after left marseilles no doubt he has been as lucky as the rest no doubt he is as rich as mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars as high in station as m_fernand_mondego
i only as you see have remained poor wretched and forgotten â you are mistaken my friend replied the abbã god may seem sometimes to forget for a time while his justice reposes but there always comes a moment when he remembersâ and beholdâ a proof as he spoke the abbã took the diamond from his pocket and giving it to m_caderousse said here my friend take this diamond it is yours â what for me only cried m_caderousse ah sir do not jest with me â this diamond was to have been shared among his friend edmond_dantã_s had one friend only and thus it cannot be divided take the diamond then and sell it it is worth fifty thousand franc and i repeat my wish that this sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness 0351m â_oh sir said m_caderousse putting out one hand timidly and with the other wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his brow â_oh sir do not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man â i know what happiness and what despair are and i never make a jest of such feelings take it then but in exchangeâ â m_caderousse who touched the diamond withdrew his hand the abbã smiled in exchange he continued give me the red silk purse that m_maximilian_morrel left on old dantã sâ chimney piece and which you tell me is still in your hand m_caderousse more and more astonished went toward a large oaken cupboard opened it and gave the abbã a long purse of faded red silk round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt the abbã took it and in return gave m_caderousse the diamond
â oh you are a man of god sir cried m_caderousse for no one knew that edmond_dantã_s had given you this diamond and you might have kept it â which said the abbã to himself you would have done the abbã rose took his hat and gloves well he said all you have told me is perfectly true then and i may believe it in every particular â see sir replied m_caderousse in this corner is a crucifix in holy woodâ here on this shelf is my wifeâ testament open this book and i will swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix i will swear to you by my soulâ salvation my faith as a christian i have told everything to you as it occurred and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear of god at the day of the last judgment â tis well said the abbã convinced by his manner and tone that m_caderousse spoke the truth â tis well and may this money profit you adieu i go far from man who thus so bitterly injure each other the abbã with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of m_caderousse opened the door himself got out and mounted his horse once more saluted the innkeeper who kept uttering his loud farewells and then returned by the road he had travelled in coming when m_caderousse turned around he saw behind him la_carconte paler and trembling more than ever is then all that i have heard really true she inquired what that he has given the diamond to us only inquired m_caderousse half bewildered with joy â_yes nothing more true see here it is the woman gazed at it a moment and then said in a gloomy voice suppose itâ false m_caderousse started and turned pale false he muttered
â false why should that man give me a false diamond 0349m to get your secret without paying for it you blockhead m_caderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an idea â_oh he said taking up his hat which he placed on the red handkerchief tied round his head we will soon find out â in what way â why the fair is on at beaucaire there are always jewellers from paris there and i will show it to them look after the house_of_peers wife and i shall be back in two hour and m_caderousse left the house_of_peers in haste and ran rapidly in the direction opposite to that which the priest had taken fifty thousand franc muttered la_carconte when left alone â_it is a large sum of money but it is not a fortune volume two 20009m 20011m 20019m chapter 28 the prison register the day after that in which the scene we have just described had taken place on the road between bellegarde and beaucaire a man of about thirty or two and thirty dressed in a bright blue frock coat nankeen trousers and a white waistcoat having the appearance and accent of an englishman presented himself before the mayor of marseilles sir said he i am chief clerk of the house_of_peers of thomson_french_of_rome we are and have been these ten year connected with the house_of_peers of m_maximilian_morrel son of marseilles we have a hundred thousand franc or thereabouts loaned on their securities and we are a little uneasy at reports that have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin i have come therefore express from rome to ask you for information â sir replied the mayor
â i know very well that during the last four or five year misfortune has seemed to pursue m_maximilian_morrel he has lost four or five vessels and suffered by three or four bankruptcies but it is not for me although i am a creditor myself to the amount of ten thousand franc to give any information as to the state of his finances ask of me as mayor what is my opinion of m_maximilian_morrel and i shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree and who has up to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality this is all i can say sir if you wish to learn more address yourself to m_de_boville the inspector of prisons no 15 rue de nouailles he has i believe two hundred thousand franc in morrelâ hand and if there be any grounds for apprehension as this is a greater amount than mine you will most probably find him better informed than myself the englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy made his bow and went away proceeding with a characteristic british stride towards the street mentioned m_de_boville was in his private room and the englishman on perceiving him made a gesture of surprise which seemed to indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence as to m_de_boville he was in such a state of despair that it was evident all the faculties of his mind absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the past the englishman with the coolness of his nation addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of marseilles
â oh sir exclaimed m_de_boville your fears are unfortunately but too well founded and you see before you a man in despair i had two hundred thousand franc placed in the hand of m_maximilian_morrel son these two hundred thousand franc were the dowry of my daughter who was to be married in a fortnight and these two hundred thousand franc were payable half on the 15th of this month and the other half on the 15th of next month i had informed m_maximilian_morrel of my desire to have these payments punctually and he has been here within the last half hour to tell me that if his ship the pharaon did not come into port on the 15th he would be wholly unable to make this payment â but said the englishman this look very much like a suspension of payment â_it look more like bankruptcy exclaimed m_de_boville despairingly the englishman appeared to reflect a moment and then said from which it would appear sir that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension â to tell you the truth i consider it lost â well then i will buy it of you â you â_yes i â but at a tremendous discount of course â no for two hundred thousand franc our house_of_peers added the englishman with a laugh does not do thing in that way â and you will payâ â ready money 20023 and the englishman drew from his pocket a bundle of bank notes which might have been twice the sum m_de_boville feared to lose a ray of joy passed across de bovilleâ countenance yet he made an effort at self control and said sir i ought to tell you that in all probability you will not realize six per cent of this sum
â thatâ no affair of mine replied the englishman that is the affair of the house_of_peers of thomson_french_of_rome in whose name i act they have perhaps some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of a rival firm but all i know sir is that i am ready to hand you over this sum in exchange for your assignment of the debt i only ask a brokerage â of course that is perfectly just cried m_de_boville the commission is usually one and a half will you have twoâ threeâ five per cent or even more whatever you say â sir replied the englishman laughing i am like my house_of_peers and do not do such thingsâ no the commission i ask is quite different â name it sir i beg â you are the inspector of prisons â i have been so these fourteen year â you keep the registers of entries and departures â i do â to these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners â there are special reports on every prisoner â well sir i was educated at rome by a poor devil of an abbã who disappeared suddenly i have since learned that he was confined in the chã teau dâ if and i should like to learn some particulars of his death â what was his name â the abbã_faria â_oh i recollect him perfectly cried m_de_boville he was crazy â so they said â_oh he was decidedly â very possibly but what sort of madness was it â he pretended to know of an immense treasure and offered vast sums to the government if they would liberate him â poor devil and he is dead â_yes sir
five or six month ago last february â you have a good memory sir to recollect dates so well â i recollect this because the poor devilâ death was accompanied by a singular incident â may i ask what that was said the englishman with an expression of curiosity which a close observer would have been astonished at discovering in his phlegmatic countenance â_oh dear yes sir the abbã s dungeon was forty or fifty foot distant from that of one of bonaparteâ emissaries one of those who had contributed the most to the return of the usurper in 1815 a very resolute and very dangerous man â indeed said the englishman â_yes replied m_de_boville i myself had occasion to see this man in 1816 or 1817 and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of soldiers that man made a deep impression on me i shall never forget his countenance 20025m the englishman smiled imperceptibly and you say sir he interposed that the two dungeonsâ â were separated by a distance of fifty foot but it appears that this edmond_dantã_s dantã sâ â this dangerous manâ name wasâ â edmond_dantã_s it appears sir that this edmond_dantã_s had procured tools or made them for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners held communication with one another â this tunnel was dug no doubt with an intention of escape â no doubt but unfortunately for the prisoners the abbã_faria had an attack of catalepsy and died â that must have cut short the projects of escape â for the dead man yes replied m_de_boville but not for the survivor on the contrary this edmond_dantã_s saw a means of accelerating his escape
he no doubt thought that prisoners who died in the chã teau dâ if were interred in an ordinary burial ground and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse and awaited the moment of interment â_it was a bold step and one that showed some courage remarked the englishman as i have already told you sir he was a very dangerous man and fortunately by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears it had on his account â how was that â how do you not comprehend â no â the chã teau dâ if has no cemetery and they simply throw the dead into the sea after fastening a thirty six pound cannon ball to their foot â well observed the englishman as if he were slow of comprehension well they fastened a thirty six pound ball to his foot and threw him into the sea â really exclaimed the englishman â_yes sir continued the inspector of prisons you may imagine the amazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the rocks i should like to have seen his face at that moment â that would have been difficult â no matter replied m_de_boville in supreme good humor at the certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand franc â no matter i can fancy it and he shouted with laughter so can i said the englishman and he laughed too but he laughed as the english do at the end of his teeth â and so continued the englishman who first gained his composure he was drowned â unquestionably â so that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same time â precisely 20027m but some official document was drawn up as to this affair i suppose inquired the englishman â_yes yes the mortuary deposition
you understand dantã sâ relations if he had any might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or alive â so that now if there were anything to inherit from him they may do so with easy conscience he is dead and no mistake about it â_oh yes and they may have the fact attested whenever they please â so be it said the englishman but to return to these registers â true this story has diverted our attention from them excuse me â excuse you for what for the story by no means it really seems to me very curious â_yes indeed so sir you wish to see all relating to the poor abbã who really was gentleness itself â_yes you will much oblige me â go into my study here and i will show it to you and they both entered de bovilleâ study everything was here arranged in perfect order each register had its number each file of paper its place the inspector begged the englishman to seat himself in an armchair and placed before him the register and documents relative to the chã teau dâ if giving him all the time he desired for the examination while m_de_boville seated himself in a corner and began to read his newspaper the englishman easily found the entries relative to the abbã_faria but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly for after having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting edmond_dantã_s there he found everything arranged in due order the accusation examination morrelâ petition de villefortâ marginal notes
he folded up the accusation quietly and put it as quietly in his pocket read the examination and saw that the name of m_noirtier_de_villefort was not mentioned in it perused too the application dated 10th april 1815 in which m_maximilian_morrel by the deputy procureurâ advice exaggerated with the best intentions for napoleon was then on the throne the services edmond_dantã_s had rendered to the imperial causeâ services which villefortâ certificates rendered indisputable then he saw through the whole thing this petition to napoleon kept back by m_noirtier_de_villefort had become under the second restoration a terrible weapon against him in the hand of the kingâ attorney he was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this note placed in a bracket against his name edmond_dantã_s an inveterate bonapartist took an active part in the return from the island of elba to be kept in strict solitary confinement and to be closely watched and guarded beneath these lines was written in another hand see note aboveâ nothing can be done he compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the certificate placed beneath morrelâ petition and discovered that the note in the bracket was the same writing as the certificateâ that is to say was in villefortâ handwriting 20029m as to the note which accompanied this the englishman understood that it might have been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary interest in dantã sâ situation but who had from the remarks we have quoted found it impossible to give any effect to the interest he had felt as we have said the inspector from discretion and that he might not disturb the abbã fariaâ pupil in his researches had seated himself in a corner and was reading le drapeau blanc
he did not see the englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars under the arbor of la rã serve and which had the postmark marseilles 27th february delivery oâ clock m but it must be said that if he had seen it he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper and so much importance to his two hundred thousand franc that he would not have opposed whatever the englishman might do however irregular it might be thanks said the latter closing the register with a slam i have all i want now it is for me to perform my promise give me a simple assignment of your debt acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash and i will hand you over the money he rose gave his seat to m_de_boville who took it without ceremony and quickly drew up the required assignment while the englishman counted out the bank notes on the other side of the desk chapter 29 the house_of_peers of m_maximilian_morrel son anyone who had quitted marseilles a few year previously well acquainted with the interior of morrelâ warehouse and had returned at this date would have found a great change instead of that air of life of comfort and of happiness that permeates a flourishing and prosperous business establishmentâ instead of merry face at the window busy clerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridorsâ instead of the court filled with bales of goods re echoing with the cries and the jokes of porters one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and gloom out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office but two remained
one was a young man of three or four and twenty who was in love with morrelâ daughter and had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friend to induce him to withdraw the other was an old one eyed cashier called cocles or cock eye a nickname given him by the young man who used to throng this vast now almost deserted bee hive and which had so completely replaced his real name that he would not in all probability have replied to anyone who addressed him by it cocles remained in morrelâ service and a most singular change had taken place in his position he had at the same time risen to the rank of cashier and sunk to the rank of a servant he was however the same cocles good patient devoted but inflexible on the subject of arithmetic the only point on which he would have stood firm against the world even against m_maximilian_morrel and strong in the multiplication table which he had at his fingersâ end no matter what scheme or what trap was laid to catch him in the midst of the disasters that befell the house_of_peers cocles was the only one unmoved but this did not arise from a want of affection on the contrary from a firm conviction like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the warehouse cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their departure
everything was as we have said a question of arithmetic to cocles and during twenty year he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude that it seemed as impossible to him that the house_of_peers should stop payment as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow nothing had as yet occurred to shake coclesâ belief the last monthâ payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude cocles had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash and the same evening he had brought them to m_maximilian_morrel who with a melancholy smile threw them into an almost empty drawer saying thanks cocles you are the pearl of cashiers cocles went away perfectly happy for this eulogium of m_maximilian_morrel himself the pearl of the honest man of marseilles flattered him more than a present of fifty crowns but since the end of the month m_maximilian_morrel had passed many an anxious hour in order to meet the payments then due he had collected all his resources and fearing lest the report of his distress should get bruited abroad at marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity he went to the beaucaire fair to sell his wifeâ and daughterâ jewels and a portion of his plate by this means the end of the month was passed but his resources were now exhausted
credit owing to the reports afloat was no longer to be had and to meet the one hundred thousand franc due on the 15th of the present month and the one hundred thousand franc due on the 15th of the next month to m_de_boville m_maximilian_morrel had in reality no hope but the return of the pharaon of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time and which had already arrived in harbor but this vessel which like the pharaon came from calcutta had been in for a fortnight while no intelligence had been received of the pharaon 20033m such was the state of affairs when the day after his interview with m_de_boville the confidential clerk of the house_of_peers of thomson_french_of_rome presented himself at morrelâ m_emmanuel received him this young man was alarmed by the appearance of every new face for every new face might be that of a new creditor come in anxiety to question the head of the house_of_peers the young man wishing to spare his employer the pain of this interview questioned the new comer but the stranger declared that he had nothing to say to m_emmanuel and that his business was with m_maximilian_morrel in person m_emmanuel sighed and summoned cocles cocles appeared and the young man bade him conduct the stranger to morrelâ apartment cocles went first and the stranger followed him on the staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen who looked with anxiety at the stranger m_maximilian_morrel is in his room is he not mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_julie said the cashier â_yes i think so at least said the young girl hesitatingly
â go and see cocles and if my father is there announce this gentleman â_it will be useless to announce me mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars returned the englishman m_maximilian_morrel does not know my name this worthy gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house_of_peers of thomson_french_of_rome with whom your father does business the young girl turned pale and continued to descend while the stranger and cocles continued to mount the staircase she entered the office where m_emmanuel was while cocles by the aid of a key he possessed opened a door in the corner of a landing place on the second staircase conducted the stranger into an antechamber opened a second door which he closed behind him and after having left the clerk of the house_of_peers of thomson_french_of_rome alone returned and signed to him that he could enter the englishman entered and found m_maximilian_morrel seated at a table turning over the formidable columns of his ledger which contained the list of his liabilities at the sight of the stranger m_maximilian_morrel closed the ledger arose and offered a seat to the stranger and when he had seen him seated resumed his own chair fourteen year had changed the worthy merchant who in his thirty sixth year at the opening of this history was now in his fiftieth his hair had turned white time and sorrow had ploughed deep furrows on his brow and his look once so firm and penetrating was now irresolute and wandering as if he feared being forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person the englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity evidently mingled with interest
â monsieur_albert said m_maximilian_morrel whose uneasiness was increased by this examination you wish to speak to me â_yes monsieur_albert you are aware from whom i come â the house_of_peers of thomson_french_of_rome at least so my cashier tells me â he has told you rightly the house_of_peers of thomson_french_of_rome had 300 000 or 400 000 franc to pay this month in france and knowing your strict punctuality have collected all the bills bearing your signature and charged me as they became due to present them and to employ the money otherwise m_maximilian_morrel sighed deeply and passed his hand over his forehead which was covered with perspiration so then sir said m_maximilian_morrel you hold bills of mine â_yes and for a considerable sum â what is the amount asked m_maximilian_morrel with a voice he strove to render firm 20035 â here is said the englishman taking a quantity of paper from his pocket an assignment of 200 000 franc to our house_of_peers by m_de_boville the inspector of prisons to whom they are due you acknowledge of course that you owe this sum to him â_yes he placed the money in my hand at four and a half per cent nearly five year ago â when are you to pay â half the 15th of this month half the 15th of next â just so and now here are 32 500 franc payable shortly they are all signed by you and assigned to our house_of_peers by the holders â i recognize them said m_maximilian_morrel whose face was suffused as he thought that for the first time in his life he would be unable to honor his own signature is
this all â no i have for the end of the month these bills which have been assigned to us by the house_of_peers of pascal and the house_of_peers of wild turner of marseilles amounting to nearly 55 000 franc in all 287 500 franc â_it is impossible to describe what m_maximilian_morrel suffered during this enumeration two hundred and eighty seven thousand five hundred franc repeated he â_yes sir replied the englishman i will not continued he after a momentâ silence conceal from you that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged yet the report is current in marseilles that you are not able to meet your liabilities at this almost brutal speech m_maximilian_morrel turned deathly pale sir said he up to this timeâ and it is now more than four and twenty year since i received the direction of this house_of_peers from my father who had himself conducted it for five and thirty yearsâ never has anything bearing the signature of m_maximilian_morrel son been dishonored â i know that replied the englishman but as a man of honor should answer another tell me fairly shall you pay these with the same punctuality m_maximilian_morrel shuddered and looked at the man who spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto shown to questions frankly put said he a straightforward answer should be given yes i shall pay if as i hope my vessel arrives safely for its arrival will again procure me the credit which the numerous accidents of which i have been the victim have deprived me but if the pharaon should be lost and this last resource be goneâ â the poor manâ eye filled with tears
â well said the other if this last resource fail you â well returned m_maximilian_morrel â_it is a cruel thing to be forced to say but already used to misfortune i must habituate myself to shame i fear i shall be forced to suspend payment â have you no friend who could assist you m_maximilian_morrel smiled mournfully in business sir said he one has no friend only correspondents â_it is true murmured the englishman then you have but one hope â but one â the last â the last â so that if this failâ â i am ruined completely ruined â as i was on my way here a vessel was coming into port â i know it sir a young man who still adheres to my fallen fortune passes a part of his time in a belvedere at the top of the house_of_peers in hopes of being the first to announce good news to me he has informed me of the arrival of this ship â and it is not yours â no she is a bordeaux vessel la gironde she comes from india also but she is not mine â perhaps she has spoken to the pharaon and brings you some tidings of her â shall i tell you plainly one thing sir i dread almost as much to receive any tidings of my vessel as to remain in doubt uncertainty is still hope then in a low voice m_maximilian_morrel added â this delay is not natural the pharaon left calcutta the 5th of february she ought to have been here a month ago â what is that said the englishman what is the meaning of that noise â_oh my god cried m_maximilian_morrel turning pale what is it a loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily and half stifled sobs
morrel rose and advanced to the door but his strength failed him and he sank into a chair the two man remained opposite one another m_maximilian_morrel trembling in every limb the stranger gazing at him with an air of profound pity the noise had ceased but it seemed that m_maximilian_morrel expected somethingâ something had occasioned the noise and something must follow the stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs and that the footsteps which were those of several person stopped at the door a key was inserted in the lock of the first door and the creaking of hinges was audible there are only two person who have the key to that door murmured m_maximilian_morrel cocles and mademoiselle_julie at this instant the second door opened and the young girl her eye bathed with tears appeared m_maximilian_morrel rose tremblingly supporting himself by the arm of the chair he would have spoken but his voice failed him â_oh father said she clasping her hand forgive your child for being the bearer of evil tidings m_maximilian_morrel again changed color mademoiselle_julie threw herself into his arm â_oh father father murmured she courage â the pharaon has gone down then said m_maximilian_morrel in a hoarse voice the young girl did not speak but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her fatherâ breast and the crew asked m_maximilian_morrel saved said the girl saved by the crew of the vessel that has just entered the harbor m_maximilian_morrel raised his two hand to heaven with an expression of resignation and sublime gratitude thanks my god said he at least thou strikest but me alone a tear moistened the eye of the phlegmatic englishman
â come in come in said m_maximilian_morrel for i presume you are all at the door scarcely had he uttered those word when madame m_maximilian_morrel entered weeping bitterly m_emmanuel followed her and in the antechamber were visible the rough face of seven or eight half naked sailors at the sight of these man the englishman started and advanced a step then restrained himself and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment madame m_maximilian_morrel sat down by her husband and took one of his hand in hers mademoiselle_julie still lay with her head on his shoulder m_emmanuel stood in the centre of the chamber and seemed to form the link between morrelâ family and the sailors at the door how did this happen said m_maximilian_morrel draw nearer penelon said the young man and tell us all about it an old seaman bronzed by the tropical sun advanced twirling the remains of a hat between his hand good day m_maximilian_morrel said he as if he had just quitted marseilles the previous evening and had just returned from aix or toulon good day penelon returned m_maximilian_morrel who could not refrain from smiling through his tears where is the captain â the captain m_maximilian_morrel he has stayed behind sick at palma but please god it wonâ be much and you will see him in a few day all alive and hearty â well now tell your story penelon 20039 penelon rolled his quid in his cheek placed his hand before his mouth turned his head and sent a long jet of tobacco juice into the antechamber advanced his foot balanced himself and began
â you see m_maximilian_morrel said he we were somewhere between cape blanc and cape boyador sailing with a fair breeze south south west after a weekâ calm when captain gaumard comes up to meâ i was at the helm i should tell youâ and says penelon what do you think of those clouds coming up over there i was just then looking at them myself what do i think captain why i think that they are rising faster than they have any business to do and that they would not be so black if they didnâ mean mischief â thatâ my opinion too said the captain and iâ ll take precautions accordingly we are carrying too much canvas avast there all hand take in the studding sails and stow the flying jib â_it was time the squall was on us and the vessel began to heel ah said the captain we have still too much canvas set all hand lower the mainsail five minute after it was down and we sailed under mizzen topsails and top gallant sails well penelon said the captain what makes you shake your head â why i says i still think youâ ve got too much on â i think youâ re right answered he we shall have a gale â a gale more than that we shall have a tempest or i donâ know whatâ what you could see the wind coming like the dust at montredon luckily the captain understood his business take in two reefs in the top sails cried the captain let go the bowlinâ haul the brace lower the top gallant sails haul out the reef tackles on the yards â 20041m that was not enough for those latitudes said the englishman i should have taken four reefs in the topsails and furled the spanker his firm sonorous and unexpected voice made everyone start
penelon put his hand over his eye and then stared at the man who thus criticized the manå uvres of his captain we did better than that sir said the old sailor respectfully we put the helm up to run before the tempest ten minute after we struck our top sails and scudded under bare poles â the vessel was very old to risk that said the englishman eh it was that that did the business after pitching heavily for twelve hour we sprung a leak penelon said the captain i think we are sinking give me the helm and go down into the hold i gave him the helm and descended there was already three foot of water all hand to the pumps i shouted but it was too late and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in ah said i after four hoursâ work since we are sinking let us sink we can die but once â is that the example you set penelon cries the captain very well wait a minute he went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols i will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump said he â well done said the englishman 20043 â thereâ nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons continued the sailor and during that time the wind had abated and the sea gone down but the water kept rising not much only two inches an hour but still it rose two inches an hour does not seem much but in twelve hour that makes two foot and three we had before that makes five
â come said the captain we have done all in our power and m_maximilian_morrel will have nothing to reproach us with we have tried to save the ship let us now save ourselves to the boats my lads as quick as you can now continued penelon you see m_maximilian_morrel a sailor is attached to his ship but still more to his life so we did not wait to be told twice the more so that the ship was sinking under us and seemed to say get alongâ save yourselves we soon launched the boat and all eight of us got into it the captain descended last or rather he did not descend he would not quit the vessel so i took him round the waist and threw him into the boat and then i jumped after him it was time for just as i jumped the deck burst with a noise like the broadside of a man of war ten minute after she pitched forward then the other way spun round and round and then good bye to the pharaon as for us we were three day without anything to eat or drink so that we began to think of drawing lots who should feed the rest when we saw la gironde we made signals of distress she perceived us made for us and took us all on board there now m_maximilian_morrel thatâ the whole truth on the honor of a sailor is not it true you fellows there a general murmur of approbation showed that the narrator had faithfully detailed their misfortunes and sufferings well well said m_maximilian_morrel i know there was no one in fault but destiny it was the will of god that this should happen blessed be his name
what wages are due to you â_oh donâ let us talk of that m_maximilian_morrel â_yes but we will talk of it â well then three month said penelon cocles pay two hundred franc to each of these good fellows said m_maximilian_morrel at another time added he i should have said give them besides two hundred franc over as a present but time are changed and the little money that remains to me is not my own so do not think me mean on this account penelon turned to his companions and exchanged a few word with them as for that m_maximilian_morrel said he again turning his quid as for thatâ â as for what â the money â wellâ â well we all say that fifty franc will be enough for us at present and that we will wait for the rest â thanks my friend thanks cried m_maximilian_morrel gratefully take itâ take it and if you can find another employer enter his service you are free to do so these last word produced a prodigious effect on the seaman penelon nearly swallowed his quid fortunately he recovered what m_maximilian_morrel said he in a low voice you send us away you are then angry with us â no no said m_maximilian_morrel i am not angry quite the contrary and i do not send you away but i have no more ships and therefore i do not want any sailors â no more ships returned penelon well then youâ ll build some weâ ll wait for you â i have no money to build ships with penelon said the poor owner mournfully so i cannot accept your kind offer â no more money
then you must not pay us we can scud like the pharaon under bare poles â enough enough cried m_maximilian_morrel almost overpowered leave me i pray you we shall meet again in a happier time m_emmanuel go with them and see that my order are executed â at least we shall see each other again m_maximilian_morrel asked penelon â_yes i hope so at least now go he made a sign to cocles who went first the seamen followed him and m_emmanuel brought up the rear now said the owner to his wife and daughter leave me i wish to speak with this gentleman 20045m and he glanced towards the clerk of thomson_french_of_rome who had remained motionless in the corner during this scene in which he had taken no part except the few word we have mentioned the two woman looked at this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten and retired but as she left the apartment mademoiselle_julie gave the stranger a supplicating glance to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent spectator would have been surprised to see on his stern features the two man were left alone well sir said m_maximilian_morrel sinking into a chair you have heard all and i have nothing further to tell you â i see returned the englishman that a fresh and unmerited misfortune has overwhelmed you and this only increases my desire to serve you â_oh sir cried m_maximilian_morrel let me see continued the stranger i am one of your largest creditors â your bills at least are the first that will fall due â do you wish for time to pay â a delay would save my honor and consequently my life â how long a delay do you wish for m_maximilian_morrel reflected two month said he
â i will give you three replied the stranger but asked m_maximilian_morrel will the house_of_peers of thomson_french_of_rome consent â_oh i take everything on myself today is the 5th of june â_yes â well renew these bills up to the 5th of september and on the 5th of september at eleven oâ clock the hand of the clock pointed to eleven i shall come to receive the money â i shall expect you returned m_maximilian_morrel and i will pay youâ or i shall be dead these last word were uttered in so low a tone that the stranger could not hear them the bills were renewed the old one destroyed and the poor ship owner found himself with three month before him to collect his resources the englishman received his thanks with the phlegm peculiar to his nation and m_maximilian_morrel overwhelming him with grateful blessings conducted him to the staircase the stranger met mademoiselle_julie on the stairs she pretended to be descending but in reality she was waiting for him â_oh sirâ said she clasping her hand mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars said the stranger one day you will receive a letter signed sinbad the sailor do exactly what the letter bids you however strange it may appear â_yes sir returned mademoiselle_julie do you promise â i swear to you i will â_it is well adieu mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars continue to be the good sweet girl you are at present and i have great hopes that heaven will reward you by giving you m_emmanuel for a husband mademoiselle_julie uttered a faint cry blushed like a rose and leaned against the baluster the stranger waved his hand and continued to descend in the court he found penelon who with a rouleau of a hundred franc in either hand seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them
â come with me my friend said the englishman i wish to speak to you chapter 30 the fifth of september the extension provided for by the agent of thomson_french_of_rome at the moment when m_maximilian_morrel expected it least was to the poor shipowner so decided a stroke of good fortune that he almost dared to believe that fate was at length grown weary of wasting her spite upon him the same day he told his wife m_emmanuel and his daughter all that had occurred and a ray of hope if not of tranquillity returned to the family unfortunately however m_maximilian_morrel had not only engagements with the house_of_peers of thomson_french_of_rome who had shown themselves so considerate towards him and as he had said in business he had correspondents and not friend when he thought the matter over he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of thomson_french_of_rome towards him and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this we had better help a man who owes us nearly 300 000 franc and have those 300 000 franc at the end of three month than hasten his ruin and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again unfortunately whether through envy or stupidity all morrelâ correspondents did not take this view and some even came to a contrary decision the bills signed by m_maximilian_morrel were presented at his office with scrupulous exactitude and thanks to the delay granted by the englishman were paid by cocles with equal punctuality cocles thus remained in his accustomed tranquillity
it was m_maximilian_morrel alone who remembered with alarm that if he had to repay on the 15th the 50 000 franc of m_de_boville and on the 30th the 32 500 franc of bills for which as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons he had time granted he must be a ruined man the opinion of all the commercial man was that under the reverses which had successively weighed down m_maximilian_morrel it was impossible for him to remain solvent great therefore was the astonishment when at the end of the month he cancelled all his obligations with his usual punctuality still confidence was not restored to all mind and the general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only until the end of the month the month passed and m_maximilian_morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his resources formerly his paper at any date was taken with confidence and was even in request m_maximilian_morrel now tried to negotiate bills at ninety day only and none of the banks would give him credit fortunately m_maximilian_morrel had some funds coming in on which he could rely and as they reached him he found himself in a condition to meet his engagements when the end of july came the agent of thomson_french_of_rome had not been again seen at marseilles the day after or two day after his visit to m_maximilian_morrel he had disappeared and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the mayor the inspector of prisons and m_maximilian_morrel his departure left no trace except in the memories of these three person as to the sailors of the pharaon they must have found snug berths elsewhere for they also had disappeared
captain gaumard recovered from his illness had returned from palma he delayed presenting himself at morrelâ but the owner hearing of his arrival went to see him the worthy shipowner knew from penelonâ recital of the captainâ brave conduct during the storm and tried to console him he brought him also the amount of his wages which captain gaumard had not dared to apply for as he descended the staircase m_maximilian_morrel met penelon who was going up penelon had it would seem made good use of his money for he was newly clad when he saw his employer the worthy tar seemed much embarrassed drew on one side into the corner of the landing place passed his quid from one cheek to the other stared stupidly with his great eye and only acknowledged the squeeze of the hand which m_maximilian_morrel as usual gave him by a slight pressure in return m_maximilian_morrel attributed penelonâ embarrassment to the elegance of his attire it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account he was no doubt engaged on board some other vessel and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having if we may so express ourselves worn mourning for the pharaon longer perhaps he had come to tell captain gaumard of his good luck and to offer him employment from his new master worthy fellows said m_maximilian_morrel as he went away may your new master love you as i loved you and be more fortunate than i have been 20049m august rolled by in unceasing efforts on the part of m_maximilian_morrel to renew his credit or revive the old
on the 20th of august it was known at marseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach and then it was said that the bills would go to protest at the end of the month and that m_maximilian_morrel had gone away and left his chief clerk m_emmanuel and his cashier cocles to meet the creditors but contrary to all expectation when the 31st of august came the house_of_peers opened as usual and cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny and from first to last paid all with the usual precision there came in moreover two drafts which m_maximilian_morrel had fully anticipated and which cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had accepted all this was incomprehensible and then with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news the failure was put off until the end of september on the 1st m_maximilian_morrel returned he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety for from this journey to paris they hoped great thing m_maximilian_morrel had thought of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who was now immensely rich and had lain under great obligations to m_maximilian_morrel in former day since to him it was owing that mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars entered the service of the spanish banker with whom he had laid the foundations of his vast wealth it was said at this moment that mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was worth from six to eight millions of franc and had unlimited credit mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars then without taking a crown from his pocket could save m_maximilian_morrel he had but to pass his word for a loan and m_maximilian_morrel was saved m_maximilian_morrel had long thought of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars but had kept away from some instinctive motive and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource
and m_maximilian_morrel was right for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal yet on his arrival m_maximilian_morrel did not utter a complaint or say one harsh word he embraced his weeping wife and daughter pressed emmanuelâ hand with friendly warmth and then going to his private room on the second floor had sent for cocles then said the two woman to m_emmanuel we are indeed ruined â_it was agreed in a brief council held among them that mademoiselle_julie should write to her brother who was in garrison at nã mes to come to them as speedily as possible the poor woman felt instinctively that they required all their strength to support the blow that impended besides m_maximilian_morrel though hardly two and twenty had great influence over his father he was a strong minded upright young man at the time when he decided on his profession his father had no desire to choose for him but had consulted young maximilianâ taste he had at once declared for a military life and had in consequence studied hard passed brilliantly through the polytechnic school and left it as sub lieutenant of the 53rd of the line for a year he had held this rank and expected promotion on the first vacancy in his regiment m_maximilian_morrel was noted for his rigid observance not only of the obligations imposed on a soldier but also of the duties of a man and he thus gained the name of the stoic we need hardly say that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it and did not even know what it meant
this was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid to sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon have to endure they had not mistaken the gravity of this event for the moment after m_maximilian_morrel had entered his private office with cocles mademoiselle_julie saw the latter leave it pale trembling and his features betraying the utmost consternation she would have questioned him as he passed by her but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with unusual precipitation and only raised his hand to heaven and exclaimed â_oh mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort what a dreadful misfortune who could ever have believed it a moment afterwards mademoiselle_julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three heavy ledgers a portfolio and a bag of money m_maximilian_morrel examined the ledgers opened the portfolio and counted the money all his funds amounted to 000 or 000 franc his bills receivable up to the 5th to 000 or 000 which making the best of everything gave him 14 000 franc to meet debts amounting to 287 500 franc he had not even the means for making a possible settlement on account however when m_maximilian_morrel went down to his dinner he appeared very calm this calmness was more alarming to the two woman than the deepest dejection would have been after dinner m_maximilian_morrel usually went out and used to take his coffee at the club of the phocã ens and read the semaphore this day he did not leave the house_of_peers but returned to his office as to cocles he seemed completely bewildered for part of the day he went into the courtyard seated himself on a stone with his head bare and exposed to the blazing sun m_emmanuel tried to comfort the woman but his eloquence faltered
the young man was too well acquainted with the business of the house_of_peers not to feel that a great catastrophe hung over the m_maximilian_morrel family night came the two woman had watched hoping that when he left his room m_maximilian_morrel would come to them but they heard him pass before their door and trying to conceal the noise of his footsteps they listened he went into his sleeping room and fastened the door inside madame m_maximilian_morrel sent her daughter to bed and half an hour after mademoiselle_julie had retired she rose took off her shoes and went stealthily along the passage to see through the keyhole what her husband was doing in the passage she saw a retreating shadow it was mademoiselle_julie who uneasy herself had anticipated her mother the young lady went towards madame m_maximilian_morrel he is writing she said they had understood each other without speaking madame m_maximilian_morrel looked again through the keyhole m_maximilian_morrel was writing but madame m_maximilian_morrel remarked what her daughter had not observed that her husband was writing on stamped paper the terrible idea that he was writing his will flashed across her she shuddered and yet had not strength to utter a word next day m_maximilian_morrel seemed as calm as ever went into his office as usual came to his breakfast punctually and then after dinner he placed his daughter beside him took her head in his arm and held her for a long time against his bosom in the evening mademoiselle_julie told her mother that although he was apparently so calm she had noticed that her fatherâ heart beat violently the next two day passed in much the same way on the evening of the 4th of september m_maximilian_morrel asked his daughter for the key of his study
julie trembled at this request which seemed to her of bad omen why did her father ask for this key which she always kept and which was only taken from her in childhood as a punishment the young girl looked at m_maximilian_morrel what have i done wrong father she said that you should take this key from me â nothing my dear replied the unhappy man the tears starting to his eye at this simple question â nothing only i want it mademoiselle_julie made a pretence to feel for the key i must have left it in my room she said and she went out but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to consult m_emmanuel do not give this key to your father said he and tomorrow morning if possible do not quit him for a moment she questioned m_emmanuel but he knew nothing or would not say what he knew during the night between the 4th and 5th of september madame m_maximilian_morrel remained listening for every sound and until three oâ clock in the morning she heard her husband pacing the room in great agitation it was three oâ clock when he threw himself on the bed the mother and daughter passed the night together they had expected m_maximilian_morrel since the previous evening at eight oâ clock in the morning m_maximilian_morrel entered their chamber he was calm but the agitation of the night was legible in his pale and careworn visage they did not dare to ask him how he had slept m_maximilian_morrel was kinder to his wife more affectionate to his daughter than he had ever been he could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet girl
julie mindful of emmanuelâ request was following her father when he quitted the room but he said to her quickly remain with your mother dearest mademoiselle_julie wished to accompany him i wish you to do so said he this was the first time m_maximilian_morrel had ever so spoken but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness and mademoiselle_julie did not dare to disobey she remained at the same spot standing mute and motionless an instant afterwards the door opened she felt two arm encircle her and a mouth pressed her forehead she looked up and uttered an exclamation of joy 20053m m_maximilian_morrel my dearest brother she cried at these word madame m_maximilian_morrel rose and threw herself into her sonâ arm mother said the young man looking alternately at madame m_maximilian_morrel and her daughter what has occurredâ what has happened your letter has frightened me and i have come hither with all speed â mademoiselle_julie said madame m_maximilian_morrel making a sign to the young man go and tell your father that m_maximilian_morrel has just arrived the young lady rushed out of the apartment but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand are you not mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_julie m_maximilian_morrel inquired the man with a strong italian accent â_yes sir replied mademoiselle_julie with hesitation what is your pleasure i do not know you â read this letter he said handing it to her mademoiselle_julie hesitated â_it concerns the best interests of your father said the messenger the young girl hastily took the letter from him she opened it quickly and read
â go this moment to the allã es de meilhan enter the house_of_peers no 15 ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor enter the apartment take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red silk and give it to your father it is important that he should receive it before eleven oâ clock you promised to obey me implicitly remember your oath sinbad the sailor the young girl uttered a joyful cry raised her eye looked round to question the messenger but he had disappeared she cast her eye again over the note to peruse it a second time and saw there was a postscript she read â_it is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and alone if you go accompanied by any other person or should anyone else go in your place the porter will reply that he does not know anything about it this postscript decreased greatly the young girlâ happiness was there nothing to fear was there not some snare laid for her her innocence had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl of her age but there is no need to know danger in order to fear it indeed it may be observed that it is usually unknown perils that inspire the greatest terror mademoiselle_julie hesitated and resolved to take counsel yet through a singular impulse it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied but to m_emmanuel she hastened down and told him what had occurred on the day when the agent of thomson_french_of_rome had come to her fatherâ related the scene on the staircase repeated the promise she had made and showed him the letter you must go then mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars said m_emmanuel go there
murmured mademoiselle_julie â_yes i will accompany you â but did you not read that i must be alone said mademoiselle_julie and you shall be alone replied the young man i will await you at the corner of the rue du musã and if you are so long absent as to make me uneasy i will hasten to rejoin you and woe to him of whom you shall have cause to complain to me â then m_emmanuel said the young girl with hesitation â_it is your opinion that i should obey this invitation â_yes did not the messenger say your fatherâ safety depended upon it â but what danger threatens him then m_emmanuel she asked m_emmanuel hesitated a moment but his desire to make mademoiselle_julie decide immediately made him reply listen he said today is the 5th of september is it not â_yes â today then at eleven oâ clock your father has nearly three hundred thousand franc to pay â_yes we know that â well then continued m_emmanuel we have not fifteen thousand franc in the house_of_peers â what will happen then â why if today before eleven oâ clock your father has not found someone who will come to his aid he will be compelled at twelve oâ clock to declare himself a bankrupt â_oh come then come cried she hastening away with the young man during this time madame m_maximilian_morrel had told her son everything the young man knew quite well that after the succession of misfortunes which had befallen his father great changes had taken place in the style of living and housekeeping but he did not know that matters had reached such a point he was thunderstruck then rushing hastily out of the apartment he ran upstairs expecting to find his father in his study but he rapped there in vain
while he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open turned and saw his father instead of going direct to his study m_maximilian_morrel had returned to his bedchamber which he was only this moment quitting m_maximilian_morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son of whose arrival he was ignorant he remained motionless on the spot pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat m_maximilian_morrel sprang down the staircase and threw his arm round his fatherâ neck but suddenly he recoiled and placed his right hand on morrelâ breast father he exclaimed turning pale as death what are you going to do with that brace of pistols under your coat â_oh this is what i feared said m_maximilian_morrel father father in heavenâ name exclaimed the young man what are these weapons for â m_maximilian_morrel replied m_maximilian_morrel looking fixedly at his son you are a man and a man of honor come and i will explain to you and with a firm step m_maximilian_morrel went up to his study while m_maximilian_morrel followed him trembling as he went m_maximilian_morrel opened the door and closed it behind his son then crossing the anteroom went to his desk on which he placed the pistols and pointed with his finger to an open ledger in this ledger was made out an exact balance sheet of his affairs m_maximilian_morrel had to pay within half an hour 287 500 franc all he possessed was 15 257 franc read said m_maximilian_morrel the young man was overwhelmed as he read m_maximilian_morrel said not a word what could he say what need he add to such a desperate proof in figures
â and have you done all that is possible father to meet this disastrous result asked the young man after a momentâ pause i have replied m_maximilian_morrel you have no money coming in on which you can rely â none â you have exhausted every resource â all â and in half an hour said m_maximilian_morrel in a gloomy voice our name is dishonored â blood washes out dishonor said m_maximilian_morrel you are right father i understand you then extending his hand towards one of the pistols he said there is one for you and one for meâ thanks m_maximilian_morrel caught his hand your motherâ your sister who will support them a shudder ran through the young manâ frame father he said do you reflect that you are bidding me to live â_yes i do so bid you answered m_maximilian_morrel â_it is your duty you have a calm strong mind m_maximilian_morrel maximilian you are no ordinary man i make no requests or commands i only ask you to examine my position as if it were your own and then judge for yourself the young man reflected for a moment then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eye and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets the insignia of his rank be it so then my father he said extending his hand to m_maximilian_morrel die in peace my father i will live m_maximilian_morrel was about to cast himself on his knees before his son but m_maximilian_morrel caught him in his arm and those two noble heart were pressed against each other for a moment you know it is not my fault said m_maximilian_morrel 20057m m_maximilian_morrel smiled i know father you are the most honorable man i have ever known â good my son
and now there is no more to be said go and rejoin your mother and sister â my father said the young man bending his knee bless me m_maximilian_morrel took the head of his son between his two hand drew him forward and kissing his forehead several time said â_oh yes yes i bless you in my own name and in the name of three generations of irreproachable man who say through me the edifice which misfortune has destroyed providence may build up again on seeing me die such a death the most inexorable will have pity on you to you perhaps they will accord the time they have refused to me then do your best to keep our name free from dishonor go to work labor young man struggle ardently and courageously live yourself your mother and sister with the most rigid economy so that from day to day the property of those whom i leave in your hand may augment and fructify reflect how glorious a day it will be how grand how solemn that day of complete restoration on which you will say in this very office my father died because he could not do what i have this day done but he died calmly and peaceably because in dying he knew what i should do â my father my father cried the young man why should you not live â if i live all would be changed if i live interest would be converted into doubt pity into hostility if i live i am only a man who has broken his word failed in his engagementsâ in fact only a bankrupt if on the contrary i die remember m_maximilian_morrel my corpse is that of an honest but unfortunate man
living my best friend would avoid my house_of_peers dead all marseilles will follow me in tears to my last home living you would feel shame at my name dead you may raise your head and say i am the son of him you killed because for the first time he has been compelled to break his word â the young man uttered a groan but appeared resigned and now said m_maximilian_morrel leave me alone and endeavor to keep your mother and sister away â will you not see my sister once more asked m_maximilian_morrel a last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview and therefore he had suggested it m_maximilian_morrel shook his head i saw her this morning and bade her adieu â have you no particular commands to leave with me my father inquired m_maximilian_morrel in a faltering voice â_yes my son and a sacred command â say it my father â the house_of_peers of thomson_french_of_rome is the only one who from humanity or it may be selfishnessâ it is not for me to read menâ heartsâ has had any pity for me its agent who will in ten minute present himself to receive the amount of a bill of 287 500 franc i will not say granted but offered me three month let this house_of_peers be the first repaid my son and respect this man â father i will said m_maximilian_morrel and now once more adieu said m_maximilian_morrel go leave me i would be alone you will find my will in the secretaire in my bedroom the young man remained standing and motionless having but the force of will and not the power of execution hear me m_maximilian_morrel said his father
â suppose i were a soldier like you and ordered to carry a certain redoubt and you knew i must be killed in the assault would you not say to me as you said just now go father for you are dishonored by delay and death is preferable to shame â â_yes yes said the young man â_yes and once again embracing his father with convulsive pressure he said be it so my father and he rushed out of the study when his son had left him m_maximilian_morrel remained an instant standing with his eye fixed on the door then putting forth his arm he pulled the bell after a momentâ interval cocles appeared it was no longer the same manâ the fearful revelations of the three last day had crushed him this thoughtâ the house_of_peers of m_maximilian_morrel is about to stop paymentâ bent him to the earth more than twenty year would otherwise have done my worthy cocles said m_maximilian_morrel in a tone impossible to describe do you remain in the antechamber when the gentleman who came three month agoâ the agent of thomson_french_of_rome frenchâ arrives announce his arrival to me cocles made no reply he made a sign with his head went into the anteroom and seated himself m_maximilian_morrel fell back in his chair his eye fixed on the clock there were seven minute left that was all the hand moved on with incredible rapidity he seemed to see its motion what passed in the mind of this man at the supreme moment of his agony cannot be told in word
he was still comparatively young he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning illogical perhaps yet certainly plausible that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world even life itself to form the slightest idea of his feelings one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and its tear moistened eye raised to heaven the minute hand moved on the pistols were loaded he stretched forth his hand took one up and murmured his daughterâ name then he laid it down seized his pen and wrote a few word it seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved daughter then he turned again to the clock counting time now not by minute but by seconds he took up the deadly weapon again his lip parted and his eye fixed on the clock and then shuddered at the click of the trigger as he cocked the pistol at this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his brow a pang stronger than death clutched at his heart strings he heard the door of the staircase creak on its hingesâ the clock gave its warning to strike elevenâ the door of his study opened m_maximilian_morrel did not turn roundâ he expected these word of cocles the agent of thomson_french_of_rome he placed the muzzle of the pistol between his teeth suddenly he heard a cryâ it was his daughterâ voice he turned and saw mademoiselle_julie the pistol fell from his hand my father cried the young girl out of breath and half dead with joyâ saved you are saved and she threw herself into his arm holding in her extended hand a red netted silk purse
20061m saved my child said m_maximilian_morrel what do you mean â_yes savedâ saved see see said the young girl m_maximilian_morrel took the purse and started as he did so for a vague remembrance reminded him that it once belonged to himself at one end was the receipted bill for the 287 000 franc and at the other was a diamond as large as a hazel nut with these word on a small slip of parchment julieâ dowry m_maximilian_morrel passed his hand over his brow it seemed to him a dream at this moment the clock struck eleven he felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his heart explain my child he said explain my child he said explainâ where did you find this purse â in a house_of_peers in the allã es de meilhan no 15 on the corner of a mantelpiece in a small room on the fifth floor â but cried m_maximilian_morrel this purse is not yours mademoiselle_julie handed to her father the letter she had received in the morning and did you go alone asked m_maximilian_morrel after he had read it m_emmanuel accompanied me father he was to have waited for me at the corner of the rue du musã but strange to say he was not there when i returned â monsieur_albert m_maximilian_morrel exclaimed a voice on the stairs monsieur_albert m_maximilian_morrel â_it is his voice said mademoiselle_julie at this moment m_emmanuel entered his countenance full of animation and joy the pharaon he cried the pharaon â what what the pharaon are you mad m_emmanuel you know the vessel is lost â the pharaon sirâ they signal the pharaon
the pharaon is entering the harbor m_maximilian_morrel fell back in his chair his strength was failing him his understanding weakened by such events refused to comprehend such incredible unheard of fabulous facts but his son came in father cried m_maximilian_morrel how could you say the pharaon was lost the lookout has signalled her and they say she is now coming into port 20063m my dear friend said m_maximilian_morrel if this be so it must be a miracle of heaven impossible impossible but what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his hand the acceptance receiptedâ the splendid diamond ah sir exclaimed cocles what can it mean the pharaon â come dear one said m_maximilian_morrel rising from his seat let us go and see and heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence they all went out and on the stairs met madame m_maximilian_morrel who had been afraid to go up into the study in a moment they were at the canebiã re there was a crowd on the pier all the crowd gave way before m_maximilian_morrel the pharaon the pharaon said every voice and wonderful to see in front of the tower of saint jean was a ship bearing on her stern these word printed in white letter the pharaon m_maximilian_morrel son of marseilles she was the exact duplicate of the other pharaon and loaded as that had been with cochineal and indigo she cast anchor clued up sails and on the deck was captain gaumard giving order and good old penelon making signals to m_maximilian_morrel to doubt any longer was impossible there was the evidence of the senses and ten thousand person who came to corroborate the testimony
as m_maximilian_morrel and his son embraced on the pier head in the presence and amid the applause of the whole city witnessing this event a man with his face half covered by a black beard and who concealed behind the sentry box watched the scene with delight uttered these word in a low tone be happy noble heart be blessed for all the good thou hast done and wilt do hereafter and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your good deeds 20064m and with a smile expressive of supreme content he left his hiding place and without being observed descended one of the flights of step provided for debarkation and hailing three time shouted jacopo_manfredi jacopo jacopo_manfredi then a launch came to shore took him on board and conveyed him to a yacht splendidly fitted up on whose deck he sprung with the activity of a sailor thence he once again looked towards m_maximilian_morrel who weeping with joy was shaking hand most cordially with all the crowd around him and thanking with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to be seeking in the skies and now said the unknown farewell kindness humanity and gratitude farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart i have been heavenâ substitute to recompense the goodâ now the god of vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked at these word he gave a signal and as if only awaiting this signal the yacht instantly put out to sea chapter 31 italy sinbad the sailor towards the beginning of the year 1838 two young man belonging to the first society of paris the viscount monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf and the baron m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay were at florence
they had agreed to see the carnival at rome that year and that m_franz_de_quesnel who for the last three or four year had inhabited italy should act as cicerone to monsieur_albert as it is no inconsiderable affair to spend the carnival at rome especially when you have no great desire to sleep on the piazza del popolo or the campo vaccino they wrote to signor_pastrini the proprietor of the hã tel de londres piazza di spagna to reserve comfortable apartments for them signor_pastrini replied that he had only two room and a parlor on the third floor which he offered at the low charge of a louis_xviii per diem they accepted his offer but wishing to make the best use of the time that was left monsieur_albert started for naples as for m_franz_de_quesnel he remained at florence and after having passed a few day in exploring the paradise of the cascine and spending two or three evening at the house of the florentine nobility he took a fancy into his head having already visited corsica the cradle of bonaparte to visit elba the waiting place of napoleon one evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring that secured it to the dock at leghorn wrapped himself in his coat and lay down and said to the crew â to the island of elba the boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning m_franz_de_quesnel disembarked at porto ferrajo he traversed the island after having followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left and re embarked for marciana two hour after he again landed at pianosa where he was assured that red partridges abounded
the sport was bad m_franz_de_quesnel only succeeded in killing a few partridges and like every unsuccessful sportsman he returned to the boat very much out of temper ah if your excellency chose said the captain you might have capital sport â where â do you see that island continued the captain pointing to a conical pile rising from the indigo sea well what is this island â the island of count_of_monte_cristo â but i have no permission to shoot over this island â your excellency does not require a permit for the island is uninhabited â ah indeed said the young man a desert island in the midst of the mediterranean must be a curiosity â_it is very natural this island is a mass of rocks and does not contain an acre of land capable of cultivation â to whom does this island belong â to tuscany â what game shall i find there â thousands of wild goats â who live upon the stones i suppose said m_franz_de_quesnel with an incredulous smile no but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices of the rocks â where can i sleep â on shore in the grottos or on board in your cloak besides if your excellency pleases we can leave as soon as you likeâ we can sail as well by night as by day and if the wind drops we can use our oars as m_franz_de_quesnel had sufficient time and his apartments at rome were not yet available he accepted the proposition upon his answer in the affirmative the sailors exchanged a few word together in a low tone well asked he what now is there any difficulty in the way â no replied the captain but
we must warn your excellency that the island is an infected port â what do you mean â count_of_monte_cristo although uninhabited yet serves occasionally as a refuge for the smugglers and pirates who come from corsica sardinia and africa and if it becomes known that we have been there we shall have to perform quarantine for six day on our return to leghorn â the deuce that puts a different face on the matter six day why thatâ as long as the almighty took to make the world too long a waitâ too long â but who will say your excellency has been to count_of_monte_cristo â_oh i shall not cried m_franz_de_quesnel nor i nor i chorused the sailors then steer for count_of_monte_cristo the captain gave his order the helm was put up and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the island m_franz_de_quesnel waited until all was in order and when the sail was filled and the four sailors had taken their placesâ three forward and one at the helmâ he resumed the conversation gaetano said he to the captain you tell me count_of_monte_cristo serves as a refuge for pirates who are it seems to me a very different kind of game from the goats â_yes your excellency and it is true â i knew there were smugglers but i thought that since the capture of algiers and the destruction of the regency pirates existed only in the romances of cooper and captain marryat â your excellency is mistaken there are pirates like the bandits who were believed to have been exterminated by pope leo xii and who yet every day rob travellers at the gates of rome has not your excellency heard that the french chargã dâ affaires was robbed six month ago within five hundred paces of velletri â oh
yes i heard that â well then if like us your excellency lived at leghorn you would hear from time to time that a little merchant vessel or an english yacht that was expected at bastia at porto ferrajo or at civita vecchia has not arrived no one knows what has become of it but doubtless it has struck on a rock and foundered now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight man who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy night near some desert and gloomy island as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest â but asked m_franz_de_quesnel who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat why do not those who have been plundered complain to the french sardinian or tuscan governments â why said gaetano with a smile â_yes why â because in the first place they transfer from the vessel to their own boat whatever they think worth taking then they bind the crew hand and foot they attach to everyoneâ neck a four and twenty pound ball a large hole is chopped in the vesselâ bottom and then they leave her at the end of ten minute the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down first one gunâ goes under then the other then they lift and sink again and both go under at once all at once thereâ a noise like a cannonâ thatâ the air blowing up the deck
soon the water rushes out of the scupper holes like a whale spouting the vessel gives a last groan spins round and round and disappears forming a vast whirlpool in the ocean and then all is over so that in five minute nothing but the eye of god can see the vessel where she lies at the bottom of the sea do you understand now said the captain why no complaints are made to the government and why the vessel never reaches port â_it is probable that if gaetano had related this previous to proposing the expedition m_franz_de_quesnel would have hesitated but now that they had started he thought it would be cowardly to draw back he was one of those man who do not rashly court danger but if danger presents itself combat it with the most unalterable coolness calm and resolute he treated any peril as he would an adversary in a duel calculated its probable method of approach retreated if at all as a point of strategy and not from cowardice was quick to see an opening for attack and won victory at a single thrust bah said he i have travelled through sicily and calabriaâ i have sailed two month in the archipelago and yet i never saw even the shadow of a bandit or a pirate â i did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project replied gaetano but you questioned me and i have answered thatâ all â_yes and your conversation is most interesting and as i wish to enjoy it as long as possible steer for count_of_monte_cristo the wind blew strongly the boat made six or seven knots an hour and they were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage
as they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another like cannon balls in an arsenal with green bushes and trees growing in the crevices as for the sailors although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing and on which a few fishing boats with their white sails were alone visible they were within fifteen miles of count_of_monte_cristo when the sun began to set behind corsica whose mountains appeared against the sky showing their rugged peaks in bold relief this mass of rock like the giant adamastor rose dead ahead a formidable barrier and intercepting the light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the expiring day at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain where it paused an instant like the fiery crest of a volcano then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base and the island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually darker half an hour after the night was quite dark fortunately the mariners were used to these latitudes and knew every rock in the tuscan archipelago for in the midst of this obscurity m_franz_de_quesnel was not without uneasinessâ corsica had long since disappeared and count_of_monte_cristo itself was invisible but the sailors seemed like the lynx to see in the dark and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation
an hour had passed since the sun had set when m_franz_de_quesnel fancied he saw at a quarter of a mile to the left a dark mass but he could not precisely make out what it was and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land he remained silent suddenly a great light appeared on the strand land might resemble a cloud but the fire was not a meteor what is this light asked he hush said the captain â_it is a fire â but you told me the island was uninhabited â i said there were no fixed habitations on it but i said also that it served sometimes as a harbor for smugglers â and for pirates â and for pirates returned gaetano repeating franzâ word â_it is for that reason i have given order to pass the island for as you see the fire is behind us â but this fire continued m_franz_de_quesnel â_it seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise man who did not wish to be seen would not light a fire â_oh that goes for nothing said gaetano if you can guess the position of the island in the darkness you will see that the fire cannot be seen from the side or from pianosa but only from the sea â you think then this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant neighbors â that is what we must find out returned gaetano fixing his eye on this terrestrial star how can you find out â you shall see gaetano consulted with his companions and after five minutesâ discussion a manå uvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about they returned the way they had come and in a few minute the fire disappeared hidden by an elevation of the land
the pilot again changed the course of the boat which rapidly approached the island and was soon within fifty paces of it gaetano lowered the sail and the boat came to rest all this was done in silence and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken gaetano who had proposed the expedition had taken all the responsibility on himself the four sailors fixed their eye on him while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row away which thanks to the darkness would not be difficult as for m_franz_de_quesnel he examined his arm with the utmost coolness he had two double barrelled guns and a rifle he loaded them looked at the priming and waited quietly during this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt and secured his trousers round his waist his foot were naked so he had no shoes and stockings to take off after these preparations he placed his finger on his lip and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea swam towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake this track soon disappeared it was evident that he had touched the shore everyone on board remained motionless for half an hour when the same luminous track was again observed and the swimmer was soon on board well exclaimed m_franz_de_quesnel and the sailors in unison they are spanish smugglers said he they have with them two corsican bandits â and what are these corsican bandits doing here with spanish smugglers â alas returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity we ought always to help one another
very often the bandits are hard pressed by gendarmes or carbineers well they see a vessel and good fellows like us on board they come and demand hospitality of us you canâ refuse help to a poor hunted devil we receive them and for greater security we stand out to sea this costs us nothing and saves the life or at least the liberty of a fellow creature who on the first occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where we can land our goods without interruption â ah said m_franz_de_quesnel then you are a smuggler occasionally gaetano â your excellency we must live somehow returned the other smiling impenetrably then you know the man who are now on count_of_monte_cristo â_oh yes we sailors are like freemasons and recognize each other by signs â and do you think we have nothing to fear if we land â nothing at all smugglers are not thieves â but these two corsican bandits said m_franz_de_quesnel calculating the chances of peril â_it is not their fault that they are bandits but that of the authorities â how so â because they are pursued for having made a stiff as if it was not in a corsicanâ nature to revenge himself â what do you mean by having made a stiff having assassinated a man said m_franz_de_quesnel continuing his investigation i mean that they have killed an enemy which is a very different thing returned the captain well said the young man let us demand hospitality of these smugglers and bandits do you think they will grant it â without doubt
â how many are they â four and the two bandits make six â just our number so that if they prove troublesome we shall be able to hold them in check so for the last time steer to count_of_monte_cristo â_yes but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions â by all means be as wise as nestor and as prudent as ulysses i do more than permit i exhort you â silence then said gaetano everyone obeyed for a man who like m_franz_de_quesnel viewed his position in its true light it was a grave one he was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know and who had no reason to be devoted to him who knew that he had several thousand franc in his belt and who had often examined his weapons which were very beautiful if not with envy at least with curiosity on the other hand he was about to land without any other escort than these man on an island which had indeed a very religious name but which did not seem to m_franz_de_quesnel likely to afford him much hospitality thanks to the smugglers and bandits the history of the scuttled vessels which had appeared improbable during the day seemed very probable at night placed as he was between two possible sources of danger he kept his eye on the crew and his gun in his hand the sailors had again hoisted sail and the vessel was once more cleaving the waves through the darkness m_franz_de_quesnel whose eye were now more accustomed to it could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing and then as they rounded a rocky point he saw the fire more brilliant than ever and about it five or six person seated
the blaze illumined the sea for a hundred paces around gaetano skirted the light carefully keeping the boat in the shadow then when they were opposite the fire he steered to the centre of the circle singing a fishing song of which his companions sung the chorus at the first word of the song the man seated round the fire arose and approached the landing place their eye fixed on the boat evidently seeking to know who the new comers were and what were their intentions they soon appeared satisfied and returned with the exception of one who remained at the shore to their fire at which the carcass of a goat was roasting when the boat was within twenty paces of the shore the man on the beach who carried a carbine presented arm after the manner of a sentinel and cried who comes there in sardinian m_franz_de_quesnel coolly cocked both barrels gaetano then exchanged a few word with this man which the traveller did not understand but which evidently concerned him will your excellency give your name or remain incognito asked the captain my name must rest unknown replied m_franz_de_quesnel merely say i am a frenchman travelling for pleasure as soon as gaetano had transmitted this answer the sentinel gave an order to one of the man seated round the fire who rose and disappeared among the rocks not a word was spoken everyone seemed occupied m_franz_de_quesnel with his disembarkment the sailors with their sails the smugglers with their goat but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other
the man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left he made a sign with his head to the sentinel who turning to the boat said sâ accommodi the italian sâ accommodi is untranslatable it means at once come enter you are welcome make yourself at home you are the master â_it is like that turkish phrase of moliã reâ that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of thing implied in its utterance the sailors did not wait for a second invitation four strokes of the oar brought them to land gaetano sprang to shore exchanged a few word with the sentinel then his comrades disembarked and lastly came m_franz_de_quesnel one of his guns was swung over his shoulder gaetano had the other and a sailor held his rifle his dress half artist half dandy did not excite any suspicion and consequently no disquietude the boat was moored to the shore and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac but doubtless the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel for he cried out not that way if you please gaetano faltered an excuse and advanced to the opposite side while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way they advanced about thirty paces and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks in which seats had been cut not unlike sentry boxes around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrtles
franz lowered a torch and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat which was doubtless one of the halting place of the wandering visitors of count_of_monte_cristo as for his suspicions once on terra firma once that he had seen the indifferent if not friendly appearance of his hosts his anxiety had quite disappeared or rather at sight of the goat had turned to appetite he mentioned this to gaetano who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat bread wine half a dozen partridges and a good fire to roast them by besides added he if the smell of their roast meat tempts you i will go and offer them two of our birds for a slice â you are a born diplomat returned m_franz_de_quesnel go and try meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which they made a fire m_franz_de_quesnel waited impatiently inhaling the aroma of the roasted meat when the captain returned with a mysterious air well said m_franz_de_quesnel anything new do they refuse â on the contrary returned gaetano the chief who was told you were a young frenchman invites you to sup with him â well observed m_franz_de_quesnel this chief is very polite and i see no objectionâ the more so as i bring my share of the supper â_oh it is not that he has plenty and to spare for supper but he makes one condition and rather a peculiar one before he will receive you at his house_of_peers â his house_of_peers has he built one here then â no but he has a very comfortable one all the same so they say
â you know this chief then â i have heard talk of him â favorably or otherwise â both â the deuce and what is this condition â that you are blindfolded and do not take off the bandage until he himself bids you m_franz_de_quesnel looked at gaetano to see if possible what he thought of this proposal ah replied he guessing franzâ thought i know this is a serious matter â what should you do in my place â i who have nothing to lose i should go 20075m you would accept â_yes were it only out of curiosity â there is something very peculiar about this chief then â listen said gaetano lowering his voice i do not know if what they say is trueâ he stopped to see if anyone was near what do they say â that this chief inhabits a cavern to which the pitti palace is nothing â what nonsense said m_franz_de_quesnel reseating himself â_it is no nonsense it is quite true cama the pilot of the saint ferdinand went in once and he came back amazed vowing that such treasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales â do you know observed m_franz_de_quesnel that with such stories you make me think of ali_pasha_of_yanina babaâ enchanted cavern â i tell you what i have been told â then you advise me to accept â_oh i donâ say that your excellency will do as you please i should be sorry to advise you in the matter m_franz_de_quesnel pondered the matter for a few moment concluded that a man so rich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he had and seeing only the prospect of a good supper accepted gaetano departed with the reply m_franz_de_quesnel was prudent and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host
he turned towards the sailor who during this dialogue had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the air of a man proud of his office and asked him how these man had landed as no vessel of any kind was visible never mind that returned the sailor i know their vessel â is it a very beautiful vessel â i would not wish for a better to sail round the world â of what burden is she â about a hundred tons but she is built to stand any weather she is what the english call a yacht â where was she built â i know not but my own opinion is she is a genoese â and how did a leader of smugglers continued m_franz_de_quesnel venture to build a vessel designed for such a purpose at genoa â i did not say that the owner was a smuggler replied the sailor no but gaetano did i thought â gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance he had not then spoken to anyone â and if this person be not a smuggler who is he â a wealthy signor who travels for his pleasure â come thought m_franz_de_quesnel he is still more mysterious since the two accounts do not agree â what is his name â if you ask him he says sinbad the sailor but i doubt if it be his real name â sinbad the sailor â_yes â and where does he reside â on the sea â what country does he come from â i do not know â have you ever seen him â sometimes
â what sort of a man is he â your excellency will judge for yourself â where will he receive me â no doubt in the subterranean palace gaetano told you of â have you never had the curiosity when you have landed and found this island deserted to seek for this enchanted palace â_oh yes more than once but always in vain we examined the grotto all over but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening they say that the door is not opened by a key but a magic word â decidedly muttered m_franz_de_quesnel this is an arabian nightsâ adventure â his excellency waits for you said a voice which he recognized as that of the sentinel he was accompanied by two of the yachtâ crew m_franz_de_quesnel drew his handkerchief from his pocket and presented it to the man who had spoken to him without uttering a word they bandaged his eye with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indiscretion afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the bandage he promised then his two guides took his arm and he went on guided by them and preceded by the sentinel after going about thirty paces he smelt the appetizing odor of the kid that was roasting and knew thus that he was passing the bivouac they then led him on about fifty paces farther evidently advancing towards that part of the shore where they would not allow gaetano to goâ a refusal he could now comprehend presently by a change in the atmosphere he knew that they were entering a cave after going on for a few seconds more he heard a crackling and it seemed to him as though the atmosphere again changed and became balmy and perfumed
at length his foot touched on a thick and soft carpet and his guides let go their hold of him there was a momentâ silence and then a voice in excellent french although with a foreign accent said welcome sir i beg you will remove your bandage â_it may be supposed then m_franz_de_quesnel did not wait for a repetition of this permission but took off the handkerchief and found himself in the presence of a man from thirty eight to forty year of age dressed in a tunisian costume that is to say a red cap with a long blue silk tassel a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold pantaloons of deep red large and full gaiters of the same color embroidered with gold like the vest and yellow slippers he had a splendid cashmere round his waist and a small sharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his girdle although of a paleness that was almost livid this man had a remarkably handsome face his eye were penetrating and sparkling his nose quite straight and projecting direct from the brow was of the pure greek type while his teeth as white as pearls were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled them his pallor was so peculiar that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of life he was not particularly tall but extremely well made and like the man of the south had small hand and foot but what astonished m_franz_de_quesnel who had treated gaetanoâ description as a fable was the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself the entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade worked with flowers of gold
in a recess was a kind of divan surmounted with a stand of arabian swords in silver scabbards and the handles resplendent with gems from the ceiling hung a lamp of venetian glass of beautiful shape and color while the foot rested on a turkey carpet in which they sunk to the instep tapestry hung before the door by which m_franz_de_quesnel had entered and also in front of another door leading into a second apartment which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated the host gave m_franz_de_quesnel time to recover from his surprise and moreover returned look for look not even taking his eye off him sir he said after a pause a thousand excuses for the precaution taken in your introduction hither but as during the greater portion of the year this island is deserted if the secret of this abode were discovered i should doubtless find on my return my temporary retirement in a state of great disorder which would be exceedingly annoying not for the loss it occasioned me but because i should not have the certainty i now possess of separating myself from all the rest of mankind at pleasure let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find hereâ that is to say a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable bed â ma foi my dear sir replied m_franz_de_quesnel make no apologies i have always observed that they bandage peopleâ eye who penetrate enchanted palaces for instance those of raoul in the huguenots and really i have nothing to complain of for what i see makes me think of the wonders of the arabian night 20079m alas
i may say with lucullus if i could have anticipated the honor of your visit i would have prepared for it but such as is my hermitage it is at your disposal such as is my supper it is yours to share if you will ali_pasha_of_yanina is the supper ready at this moment the tapestry moved aside and a nubian black as ebony and dressed in a plain white tunic made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the dining room now said the unknown to m_franz_de_quesnel i do not know if you are of my opinion but i think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hour together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one another pray observe that i too much respect the laws of hospitality to ask your name or title i only request you to give me one by which i may have the pleasure of addressing you as for myself that i may put you at your ease i tell you that i am generally called sinbad the sailor â and i replied m_franz_de_quesnel will tell you as i only require his wonderful lamp to make me precisely like aladdin that i see no reason why at this moment i should not be called aladdin that will keep us from going away from the east whither i am tempted to think i have been conveyed by some good genius â well then signor aladdin replied the singular amphitryon you heard our repast announced will you now take the trouble to enter the dining room your humble servant going first to show the way at these word moving aside the tapestry sinbad preceded his guest
franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment the table was splendidly covered and once convinced of this important point he cast his eye around him the dining room was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left it was entirely of marble with antique bas reliefs of priceless value and at the four corners of this apartment which was oblong were four magnificent statues having baskets in their hand these baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit there were sicily pine apples pomegranates from malaga oranges from the balearic isles peaches from france and dates from tunis the supper consisted of a roast pheasant garnished with corsican blackbirds a boarâ ham with jelly a quarter of a kid with tartar sauce a glorious turbot and a gigantic lobster between these large dishes were smaller one containing various dainties the dishes were of silver and the plates of japanese china m_franz_de_quesnel rubbed his eye in order to assure himself that this was not a dream ali_pasha_of_yanina alone was present to wait at table and acquitted himself so admirably that the guest complimented his host thereupon â_yes replied he while he did the honor of the supper with much ease and graceâ â_yes he is a poor devil who is much devoted to me and does all he can to prove it he remembers that i saved his life and as he has a regard for his head he feels some gratitude towards me for having kept it on his shoulders ali_pasha_of_yanina approached his master took his hand and kissed it would it be impertinent signor sinbad said m_franz_de_quesnel to ask you the particulars of this kindness 20081m â_oh they are simple enough replied the host
â it seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the bey of tunis than etiquette permits to one of his color and he was condemned by the bey to have his tongue cut out and his hand and head cut off the tongue the first day the hand the second and the head the third i always had a desire to have a mute in my service so learning the day his tongue was cut out i went to the bey and proposed to give him for ali_pasha_of_yanina a splendid double barreled gun which i knew he was very desirous of having he hesitated a moment he was so very desirous to complete the poor devilâ punishment but when i added to the gun an english cutlass with which i had shivered his highnessâ yataghan to pieces the bey yielded and agreed to forgive the hand and head but on condition that the poor fellow never again set foot in tunis this was a useless clause in the bargain for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the shores of africa he runs down below and can only be induced to appear again when we are out of sight of that quarter of the globe m_franz_de_quesnel remained a moment silent and pensive hardly knowing what to think of the half kindness half cruelty with which his host related the brief narrative and like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed he said by way of changing the conversation you pass your life in travelling â_yes i made a vow at a time when i little thought i should ever be able to accomplish it said the unknown with a singular smile and i made some others also which i hope i may fulfil in due season
although sinbad pronounced these word with much calmness his eye gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity you have suffered a great deal sir said m_franz_de_quesnel inquiringly sinbad started and looked fixedly at him as he replied what makes you suppose so â everything answered m_franz_de_quesnel â your voice your look your pallid complexion and even the life you lead â i i live the happiest life possible the real life of a pasha i am king of all creation i am pleased with one place and stay there i get tired of it and leave it i am free as a bird and have wings like one my attendants obey my slightest wish sometimes i amuse myself by delivering some bandit or criminal from the bonds of the law then i have my mode of dispensing justice silent and sure without respite or appeal which condemns or pardons and which no one sees ah if you had tasted my life you would not desire any other and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there â revenge for instance observed m_franz_de_quesnel the unknown fixed on the young man one of those look which penetrate into the depth of the heart and thoughts and why revenge he asked because replied m_franz_de_quesnel you seem to me like a man who persecuted by society has a fearful account to settle with it â ah responded sinbad laughing with his singular laugh which displayed his white and sharp teeth you have not guessed rightly such as you see me i am a sort of philosopher and one day perhaps i shall go to paris to rival monsieur_albert appert and the man in the little blue cloak â and will that be the first time you ever took that journey â_yes it will
i must seem to you by no means curious but i assure you that it is not my fault i have delayed it so longâ it will happen one day or the other 20083m and do you propose to make this journey very shortly â i do not know it depends on circumstances which depend on certain arrangements â i should like to be there at the time you come and i will endeavor to repay you as far as lies in my power for your liberal hospitality displayed to me at count_of_monte_cristo â i should avail myself of your offer with pleasure replied the host but unfortunately if i go there it will be in all probability incognito the supper appeared to have been supplied solely for m_franz_de_quesnel for the unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to which his guest did ample justice then ali_pasha_of_yanina brought on the dessert or rather took the baskets from the hand of the statues and placed them on the table between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver cover the care with which ali_pasha_of_yanina placed this cup on the table roused franzâ curiosity he raised the cover and saw a kind of greenish paste something like preserved angelica but which was perfectly unknown to him he replaced the lid as ignorant of what the cup contained as he was before he had looked at it and then casting his eye towards his host he saw him smile at his disappointment
â you cannot guess said he what there is in that small vase can you â no i really cannot â well then that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which hebe served at the table of jupiter â but replied m_franz_de_quesnel this ambrosia no doubt in passing through mortal hand has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human name in vulgar phrase what may you term this composition for which to tell the truth i do not feel any particular desire â ah thus it is that our material origin is revealed cried sinbad we frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing without regarding it or if we do see and regard it yet without recognizing it are you a man for the substantials and is gold your god taste this and the mines of peru guzerat and golconda are opened to you are you a man of imaginationâ a poet taste this and the boundaries of possibility disappear the fields of infinite space open to you you advance free in heart free in mind into the boundless realms of unfettered reverie are you ambitious and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth taste this and in an hour you will be a king not a king of a petty kingdom hidden in some corner of europe like france spain or england but king of the world king of the universe king of creation without bowing at the foot of satan you will be king and master of all the kingdoms of the earth is it not tempting what i offer you and is it not an easy thing since it is only to do thus look
at these word he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so lauded took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat raised it to his lip and swallowed it slowly with his eye half shut and his head bent backwards m_franz_de_quesnel did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite sweetmeat but when he had finished he inquired what then is this precious stuff â did you ever hear he replied of the old man of the mountain who attempted to assassinate philippe auguste â of course i have â well you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the mountain whence he derived his picturesque name in this valley were magnificent gardens planted by hassen ben sabah and in these gardens isolated pavilions into these pavilions he admitted the elect and there says marco polo gave them to eat a certain herb which transported them to paradise in the midst of ever blooming shrubs ever ripe fruit and ever lovely virgins what these happy person took for reality was but a dream but it was a dream so soft so voluptuous so enthralling that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave it to them and obedient to his order as to those of a deity struck down the designated victim died in torture without a murmur believing that the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life of delights of which the holy herb now before you had given them a slight foretaste â then cried m_franz_de_quesnel â_it is hashish
i know thatâ by name at least â that is it precisely signor aladdin it is hashishâ the purest and most unadulterated hashish of alexandria the hashish of abou gor the celebrated maker the only man the man to whom there should be built a palace inscribed with these word a grateful world to the dealer in happiness â do you know said m_franz_de_quesnel i have a very great inclination to judge for myself of the truth or exaggeration of your eulogies â judge for yourself signor aladdinâ judge but do not confine yourself to one trial like everything else we must habituate the senses to a fresh impression gentle or violent sad or joyous there is a struggle in nature against this divine substance in nature which is not made for joy and clings to pain nature subdued must yield in the combat the dream must succeed to reality and then the dream reigns supreme then the dream becomes life and life becomes the dream but what changes occur it is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the joys of the assumed existence that you would desire to live no longer but to dream thus forever when you return to this mundane sphere from your visionary world you would seem to leave a neapolitan spring for a lapland winterâ to quit paradise for earthâ heaven for hell taste the hashish guest of mineâ taste the hashish franzâ only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous preparation about as much in quantity as his host had eaten and lift it to his mouth diable he said after having swallowed the divine preserve
â i do not know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe but the thing does not appear to me as palatable as you say â because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of the substances it flavors tell me the first time you tasted oysters tea porter truffles and sundry other dainties which you now adore did you like them could you comprehend how the romans stuffed their pheasants with assafå tida and the chinese eat swallowsâ nests eh no well it is the same with hashish only eat for a week and nothing in the world will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor which now appears to you flat and distasteful let us now go into the adjoining chamber which is your apartment and ali_pasha_of_yanina will bring us coffee and pipes they both arose and while he who called himself sinbadâ and whom we have occasionally named so that we might like his guest have some title by which to distinguish himâ gave some order to the servant m_franz_de_quesnel entered still another apartment it was simply yet richly furnished it was round and a large divan completely encircled it divan wall ceiling floor were all covered with magnificent skins as soft and downy as the richest carpets there were heavy maned lion skins from atlas striped tiger skins from bengal panther skins from the cape spotted beautifully like those that appeared to dante bear skins from siberia fox skins from norway and so on and all these skins were strewn in profusion one on the other so that it seemed like walking over the most mossy turf or reclining on the most luxurious bed
both laid themselves down on the divan chibouques with jasmine tubes and amber mouthpieces were within reach and all prepared so that there was no need to smoke the same pipe twice each of them took one which ali_pasha_of_yanina lighted and then retired to prepare the coffee there was a momentâ silence during which sinbad gave himself up to thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly even in the midst of his conversation and m_franz_de_quesnel abandoned himself to that mute reverie into which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco which seems to remove with its fume all the troubles of the mind and to give the smoker in exchange all the visions of the soul ali_pasha_of_yanina brought in the coffee how do you take it inquired the unknown in the french or turkish style strong or weak sugar or none cool or boiling as you please it is ready in all way â i will take it in the turkish style replied m_franz_de_quesnel and you are right said his host â_it shows you have a tendency for an oriental life ah those orientals they are the only man who know how to live as for me he added with one of those singular smile which did not escape the young man when i have completed my affairs in paris i shall go and die in the east and should you wish to see me again you must seek me at cairo bagdad or ispahan 20087m ma foi said m_franz_de_quesnel â_it would be the easiest thing in the world for i feel eagleâ wings springing out at my shoulders and with those wings i could make a tour of the world in four and twenty hour â ah yes the hashish is beginning its work
well unfurl your wings and fly into superhuman regions fear nothing there is a watch over you and if your wings like those of icarus melt before the sun we are here to ease your fall he then said something in arabic to ali_pasha_of_yanina who made a sign of obedience and withdrew but not to any distance as to m_franz_de_quesnel a strange transformation had taken place in him all the bodily fatigue of the day all the preoccupation of mind which the events of the evening had brought on disappeared as they do at the first approach of sleep when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of the coming of slumber his body seemed to acquire an airy lightness his perception brightened in a remarkable manner his senses seemed to redouble their power the horizon continued to expand but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms and which he had seen before he slept but a blue transparent unbounded horizon with all the blue of the ocean all the spangles of the sun all the perfumes of the summer breeze then in the midst of the songs of his sailors songs so clear and sonorous that they would have made a divine harmony had their notes been taken down he saw the island of count_of_monte_cristo no longer as a threatening rock in the midst of the waves but as an oasis in the desert then as his boat drew nearer the songs became louder for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven as if some loreley had decreed to attract a soul thither or amphion the enchanter intended there to build a city
at length the boat touched the shore but without effort without shock as lip touch lip and he entered the grotto amidst continued strains of most delicious melody he descended or rather seemed to descend several step inhaling the fresh and balmy air like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of circe formed from such perfumes as set the mind a dreaming and such fires as burn the very senses and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep from sinbad his singular host to ali_pasha_of_yanina the mute attendant then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his eye like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is extinguished and he was again in the chamber of statues lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure they were the same statues rich in form in attraction and poesy with eye of fascination smile of love and bright and flowing hair they were phryne cleopatra messalina those three celebrated courtesans then among them glided like a pure ray like a christian angel in the midst of olympus one of those chaste figures those calm shadows those soft visions which seemed to veil its virgin brow before these marble wantons
then the three statues advanced towards him with look of love and approached the couch on which he was reposing their foot hidden in their long white tunics their throats bare hair flowing like waves and assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist but which saints withstood and look inflexible and ardent like those with which the serpent charms the bird and then he gave way before look that held him in a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss it seemed to m_franz_de_quesnel that he closed his eye and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the prophet to the elect lip of stone turned to flame breasts of ice became like heated lava so that to m_franz_de_quesnel yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug love was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lip and he was held in cool serpent like embraces the more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more his senses yielded to its thrall and at length weary of a struggle that taxed his very soul he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble goddesses and the enchantment of his marvellous dream chapter 32 the waking when m_franz_de_quesnel returned to himself he seemed still to be in a dream he thought himself in a sepulchre into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely penetrated he stretched forth his hand and touched stone he rose to his seat and found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of dry heather very soft and odoriferous
the vision had fled and as if the statues had been but shadows from the tomb they had vanished at his waking he advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came and to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality he found that he was in a grotto went towards the opening and through a kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky the air and water were shining in the beams of the morning sun on the shore the sailors were sitting chatting and laughing and at ten yards from them the boat was at anchor undulating gracefully on the water there for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach that left against the rocks a lace of foam as white as silver he was for some time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the thing of nature specially after a fantastic dream then gradually this view of the outer world so calm so pure so grand reminded him of the illusiveness of his vision and once more awakened memory he recalled his arrival on the island his presentation to a smuggler chief a subterranean palace full of splendor an excellent supper and a spoonful of hashish it seemed however even in the very face of open day that at least a year had elapsed since all these thing had passed so deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream and so strong a hold had it taken of his imagination
thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors seated on a rock or undulating in the vessel one of the shadows which had shared his dream with look and kisses otherwise his head was perfectly clear and his body refreshed he was free from the slightest headache on the contrary he felt a certain degree of lightness a faculty for absorbing the pure air and enjoying the bright sunshine more vividly than ever he went gayly up to the sailors who rose as soon as they perceived him and the patron accosting him said the signor sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency and desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his leave in person but he trusts you will excuse him as very important business calls him to malaga â so then gaetano said m_franz_de_quesnel this is then all reality there exists a man who has received me in this island entertained me right royally and has departed while i was asleep â he exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails spread and if you will use your glass you will in all probability recognize your host in the midst of his crew so saying gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was making sail towards the southern point of corsica m_franz_de_quesnel adjusted his telescope and directed it towards the yacht gaetano was not mistaken at the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards the shore and holding a spy glass in his hand he was attired as he had been on the previous evening and waved his pocket handkerchief to his guest in token of adieu
franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of signals after a second a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel which rose gracefully as it expanded in the air and then m_franz_de_quesnel heard a slight report there do you hear observed gaetano he is bidding you adieu the young man took his carbine and fired it in the air but without any idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the yacht from the shore what are your excellencyâ order inquired gaetano in the first place light me a torch â ah yes i understand replied the patron to find the entrance to the enchanted apartment with much pleasure your excellency if it would amuse you and i will get you the torch you ask for but i too have had the idea you have and two or three time the same fancy has come over me but i have always given it up giovanni light a torch he added and give it to his excellency giovanni obeyed m_franz_de_quesnel took the lamp and entered the subterranean grotto followed by gaetano he recognized the place where he had awaked by the bed of heather that was there but it was in vain that he carried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto he saw nothing unless that by traces of smoke others had before him attempted the same thing and like him in vain
yet he did not leave a foot of this granite wall as impenetrable as futurity without strict scrutiny he did not see a fissure without introducing the blade of his hunting sword into it or a projecting point on which he did not lean and press in the hopes it would give way all was vain and he lost two hour in his attempts which were at last utterly useless at the end of this time he gave up his search and gaetano smiled when m_franz_de_quesnel appeared again on the shore the yacht only seemed like a small white speck on the horizon he looked again through his glass but even then he could not distinguish anything gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats which he had utterly forgotten he took his fowling piece and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty rather than enjoying a pleasure and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two kids these animals though wild and agile as chamois were too much like domestic goats and m_franz_de_quesnel could not consider them as game moreover other idea much more enthralling occupied his mind since the evening before he had really been the hero of one of the tales of the thousand and one night and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto then in spite of the failure of his first search he began a second after having told gaetano to roast one of the two kids the second visit was a long one and when he returned the kid was roasted and the repast ready
franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper and he saw the little yacht now like a sea gull on the wave continuing her flight towards corsica why he remarked to gaetano you told me that signor sinbad was going to malaga while it seems he is in the direction of porto vecchio â donâ you remember said the patron i told you that among the crew there were two corsican brigands â true and he is going to land them added m_franz_de_quesnel precisely so replied gaetano ah he is one who fears neither god nor satan they say and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his course to do a poor devil a service 20093m but such services as these might involve him with the authorities of the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy said m_franz_de_quesnel and what cares he for that replied gaetano with a laugh or any authorities he smile at them let them try to pursue him why in the first place his yacht is not a ship but a bird and he would beat any frigate three knots in every nine and if he were to throw himself on the coast why is he not certain of finding friend everywhere â_it was perfectly clear that the signor sinbad franzâ host had the honor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along the whole coast of the mediterranean and so enjoyed exceptional privileges as to m_franz_de_quesnel he had no longer any inducement to remain at count_of_monte_cristo
he had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the grotto he consequently despatched his breakfast and his boat being ready he hastened on board and they were soon under way at the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht as it disappeared in the gulf of porto vecchio with it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night and then supper sinbad hashish statues all became a dream for m_franz_de_quesnel the boat sailed on all day and all night and next morning when the sun rose they had lost sight of count_of_monte_cristo when m_franz_de_quesnel had once again set foot on shore he forgot for the moment at least the events which had just passed while he finished his affairs of pleasure at florence and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion who was awaiting him at rome he set out and on the saturday evening reached the place de la douane by the mail coach an apartment as we have said had been retained beforehand and thus he had but to go to signor pastriniâ hotel but this was not so easy a matter for the streets were thronged with people and rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events and at rome there are four great events in every year the carnival holy week corpus christi and the feast of st peter
all the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy between life and death which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the nextâ a sublime spot a resting place full of poetry and character and at which m_franz_de_quesnel had already halted five or six time and at each time found it more marvellous and striking at last he made his way through the mob which was continually increasing and getting more and more turbulent and reached the hotel on his first inquiry he was told with the impertinence peculiar to hired hackney coachmen and innkeepers with their house full that there was no room for him at the hã tel de londres then he sent his card to signor_pastrini and asked for monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf this plan succeeded and signor_pastrini himself ran to him excusing himself for having made his excellency wait scolding the waiters taking the candlestick from the porter who was ready to pounce on the traveller and was about to lead him to monsieur_albert when viscount_albert_de_morcerf himself appeared the apartment consisted of two small room and a parlor the two room looked on to the streetâ a fact which signor_pastrini commented upon as an inappreciable advantage the rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be a sicilian or maltese but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller belonged very good signor_pastrini said m_franz_de_quesnel but we must have some supper instantly and a carriage for tomorrow and the following day â as to supper replied the landlord you shall be served immediately but as for the carriageâ â what as to the carriage exclaimed monsieur_albert
â come come signor_pastrini no joking we must have a carriage â sir replied the host we will do all in our power to procure you oneâ this is all i can say â and when shall we know inquired m_franz_de_quesnel tomorrow morning answered the innkeeper â_oh the deuce then we shall pay the more thatâ all i see plainly enough at drakeâ or aaronâ one pays twenty five lire for common day and thirty or thirty five lire a day more for sundays and feast day add five lire a day more for extras that will make forty and thereâ an end of it â i am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a carriage â then they must put horse to mine it is a little worse for the journey but thatâ no matter â there are no horse monsieur_albert looked at m_franz_de_quesnel like a man who hears a reply he does not understand do you understand that my dear franzâ no horse he said but canâ we have post horse â they have been all hired this fortnight and there are none left but those absolutely requisite for posting â what are we to say to this asked m_franz_de_quesnel i say that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension i am accustomed not to dwell on that thing but to pass to another is supper ready signor_pastrini â_yes your excellency â well then let us sup â but the carriage and horse said m_franz_de_quesnel be
easy my dear boy they will come in due season it is only a question of how much shall be charged for them viscount_albert_de_morcerf then with that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to a full purse or well lined pocketbook supped went to bed slept soundly and dreamed he was racing all over rome at carnival time in a coach with six horse chapter 33 roman bandits the next morning m_franz_de_quesnel woke first and instantly rang the bell the sound had not yet died away when signor_pastrini himself entered well excellency said the landlord triumphantly and without waiting for m_franz_de_quesnel to question him i feared yesterday when i would not promise you anything that you were too lateâ there is not a single carriage to be hadâ that is for the three last daysâ â_yes returned m_franz_de_quesnel for the very three day it is most needed â what is the matter said monsieur_albert entering no carriage to be had â just so returned m_franz_de_quesnel you have guessed it â well your eternal city is a nice sort of place â that is to say excellency replied signor_pastrini who was desirous of keeping up the dignity of the capital of the christian world in the eye of his guest that there are no carriage to be had from sunday to tuesday evening but from now till sunday you can have fifty if you please â ah that is something said monsieur_albert today is thursday and who knows what may arrive between this and sunday â ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive replied m_franz_de_quesnel which will make it still more difficult â my friend said viscount_albert_de_morcerf let us enjoy the present without gloomy forebodings for the future â at least we can have a window â where â in the corso â ah a window exclaimed signor_pastrini â utterly impossible
there was only one left on the fifth floor of the doria palace and that has been let to a russian prince for twenty sequins a day the two young man looked at each other with an air of stupefaction well said m_franz_de_quesnel to monsieur_albert do you know what is the best thing we can do it is to pass the carnival at venice there we are sure of obtaining gondolas if we cannot have carriage â ah the devil no cried monsieur_albert i came to rome to see the carnival and i will though i see it on stilts â bravo an excellent idea we will disguise ourselves as monster pulchinellos or shepherds of the landes and we shall have complete success â do your excellencies still wish for a carriage from now to sunday morning â parbleu said monsieur_albert do you think we are going to run about on foot in the streets of rome like lawyersâ clerks â i hasten to comply with your excellenciesâ wishes only i tell you beforehand the carriage will cost you six piastres a day â and as i am not a millionaire like the gentleman in the next apartments said m_franz_de_quesnel i warn you that as i have been four time before at rome i know the prices of all the carriage we will give you twelve piastres for today tomorrow and the day after and then you will make a good profit â but excellencyâ said signor_pastrini still striving to gain his point
â now go returned m_franz_de_quesnel or i shall go myself and bargain with your affettatore who is mine also he is an old friend of mine who has plundered me pretty well already and in the hope of making more out of me he will take a less price than the one i offer you you will lose the preference and that will be your fault â do not give yourselves the trouble excellency returned signor_pastrini with the smile peculiar to the italian speculator when he confesses defeat i will do all i can and i hope you will be satisfied â and now we understand each other â when do you wish the carriage to be here â in an hour â in an hour it will be at the door an hour after the vehicle was at the door it was a hack conveyance which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion but in spite of its humble exterior the young man would have thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three day of the carnival excellency cried the cicerone seeing m_franz_de_quesnel approach the window shall i bring the carriage nearer to the palace accustomed as m_franz_de_quesnel was to the italian phraseology his first impulse was to look round him but these word were addressed to him m_franz_de_quesnel was the excellency the vehicle was the carriage and the hã tel de londres was the palace the genius for laudation characteristic of the race was in that phrase m_franz_de_quesnel and monsieur_albert descended the carriage approached the palace their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats the cicerone sprang into the seat behind where do your excellencies wish to go asked he to
saint peterâ first and then to the colosseum returned monsieur_albert but monsieur_albert did not know that it takes a day to see saint peterâ and a month to study it the day was passed at saint peterâ alone suddenly the daylight began to fade away m_franz_de_quesnel took out his watchâ it was half past four they returned to the hotel at the door m_franz_de_quesnel ordered the coachman to be ready at eight he wished to show monsieur_albert the colosseum by moonlight as he had shown him saint peterâ by daylight when we show a friend a city one has already visited we feel the same pride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have been he was to leave the city by the porta del popolo skirt the outer wall and re enter by the porta san giovanni thus they would behold the colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the capitol the forum the arch of septimus severus the temple of antoninus and faustina and the via sacra they sat down to dinner signor_pastrini had promised them a banquet he gave them a tolerable repast at the end of the dinner he entered in person m_franz_de_quesnel thought that he came to hear his dinner praised and began accordingly but at the first word he was interrupted excellency said signor_pastrini i am delighted to have your approbation but it was not for that i came â did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage asked monsieur_albert lighting his cigar no and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer at rome thing can or cannot be done when you are told anything cannot be done there is an end of it â_it is much more convenient at paris
when anything cannot be done you pay double and it is done directly â that is what all the french say returned signor_pastrini somewhat piqued for that reason i do not understand why they travel â but said monsieur_albert emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs only madmen or blockheads like us ever do travel man in their senses do not quit their hotel in the rue du helder their walk on the boulevard de gand and the cafã de paris â_it is of course understood that monsieur_albert resided in the aforesaid street appeared every day on the fashionable walk and dined frequently at the only restaurant where you can really dine that is if you are on good terms with its waiters signor_pastrini remained silent a short time it was evident that he was musing over this answer which did not seem very clear but said m_franz_de_quesnel in his turn interrupting his hostâ meditations you had some motive for coming here may i beg to know what it was 20099m ah yes you have ordered your carriage at eight oâ clock precisely â i have â you intend visiting il colosseo â you mean the colosseum â_it is the same thing you have told your coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo to drive round the wall and re enter by the porta san giovanni â these are my word exactly â well this route is impossible â impossible â very dangerous to say the least â dangerous and why â on account of the famous luigi_vampa â pray who may this famous luigi_vampa be inquired monsieur_albert he may be very famous at rome but i can assure you he is quite unknown at paris â what do you not know
him â i have not that honor â you have never heard his name â never â well then he is a bandit compared to whom the decesaris and the gasparones were mere child â now then monsieur_albert cried m_franz_de_quesnel here is a bandit for you at last â i forewarn you signor_pastrini that i shall not believe one word of what you are going to tell us having told you this begin once upon a timeâ â well go on signor_pastrini turned toward m_franz_de_quesnel who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two we must do him justice he had had a great many frenchmen in his house_of_peers but had never been able to comprehend them excellency said he gravely addressing m_franz_de_quesnel if you look upon me as a liar it is useless for me to say anything it was for your interest iâ â monsieur_albert does not say you are a liar signor_pastrini said m_franz_de_quesnel but that he will not believe what you are going to tell us but i will believe all you say so proceed â but if your excellency doubt my veracityâ â signor_pastrini returned m_franz_de_quesnel you are more susceptible than cassandra who was a prophetess and yet no one believed her while you at least are sure of the credence of half your audience
come sit down and tell us all about this signor luigi_vampa â i had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had since the day of mastrilla â well what has this bandit to do with the order i have given the coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo and to re enter by the porta san giovanni 20101m this replied signor_pastrini that you will go out by one but i very much doubt your returning by the other â why asked m_franz_de_quesnel because after nightfall you are not safe fifty yards from the gates â on your honor is that true cried monsieur_albert count returned signor_pastrini hurt at albertâ repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions i do not say this to you but to your companion who knows rome and knows too that these thing are not to be laughed at â my dear fellow said monsieur_albert turning to m_franz_de_quesnel here is an admirable adventure we will fill our carriage with pistols blunderbusses and double barrelled guns luigi_vampa comes to take us and we take himâ we bring him back to rome and present him to his holiness the pope who asks how he can repay so great a service then we merely ask for a carriage and a pair of horse and we see the carnival in the carriage and doubtless the roman people will crown us at the capitol and proclaim us like curtius and horatius cocles the preservers of their country whilst monsieur_albert proposed this scheme signor pastriniâ face assumed an expression impossible to describe and pray asked m_franz_de_quesnel where are these pistols blunderbusses and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage â not out of my armory for at terracina i was plundered even of my hunting knife
and you â i shared the same fate at aquapendente â do you know signor_pastrini said monsieur_albert lighting a second cigar at the first that this practice is very convenient for bandits and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own doubtless signor_pastrini found this pleasantry compromising for he only answered half the question and then he spoke to m_franz_de_quesnel as the only one likely to listen with attention your excellency knows that it is not customary to defend yourself when attacked by bandits â what cried monsieur_albert whose courage revolted at the idea of being plundered tamely not make any resistance â no for it would be useless what could you do against a dozen bandits who spring out of some pit ruin or aqueduct and level their pieces at you â eh parbleu they should kill me the innkeeper turned to m_franz_de_quesnel with an air that seemed to say your friend is decidedly mad â my dear monsieur_albert returned m_franz_de_quesnel your answer is sublime and worthy the let him die of corneille only when horace made that answer the safety of rome was concerned but as for us it is only to gratify a whim and it would be ridiculous to risk our life for so foolish a motive monsieur_albert poured himself out a glass of lacryma christi which he sipped at intervals muttering some unintelligible word well signor_pastrini said m_franz_de_quesnel now that my companion is quieted and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are tell me who is this luigi_vampa is he a shepherd or a nobleman young or old tall or short
describe him in order that if we meet him by chance like jean sbogar or lara we may recognize him â you could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these points for i knew him when he was a child and one day that i fell into his hand going from ferentino to alatri he fortunately for me recollected me and set me free not only without ransom but made me a present of a very splendid watch and related his history to me â let us see the watch said monsieur_albert signor_pastrini drew from his fob a magnificent brã guet bearing the name of its maker of parisian manufacture and a countâ coronet here it is said he peste returned monsieur_albert i compliment you on it i have its fellowâ he took his watch from his waistcoat pocketâ and it cost me 000 franc â let us hear the history said m_franz_de_quesnel motioning signor_pastrini to seat himself your excellencies permit it asked the host pardieu cried monsieur_albert you are not a preacher to remain standing the host sat down after having made each of them a respectful bow which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning luigi_vampa you tell me said m_franz_de_quesnel at the moment signor_pastrini was about to open his mouth that you knew luigi_vampa when he was a childâ he is still a young man then â a young man he is only two and twenty he will gain himself a reputation
â what do you think of that monsieur_albert at two and twenty to be thus famous â_yes and at his age alexander_vi cã_sar_borgia and napoleon who have all made some noise in the world were quite behind him â so continued m_franz_de_quesnel the hero of this history is only two and twenty â scarcely so much â is he tall or short â of the middle heightâ about the same stature as his excellency returned the host pointing to monsieur_albert thanks for the comparison said monsieur_albert with a bow go on signor_pastrini continued m_franz_de_quesnel smiling at his friendâ susceptibility to what class of society does he belong â he was a shepherd boy attached to the farm of the count of san felice situated between palestrina and the lake of gabri he was born at pampinara and entered the countâ service when he was five year old his father was also a shepherd who owned a small flock and lived by the wool and the milk which he sold at rome when quite a child the little luigi_vampa displayed a most extraordinary precocity one day when he was seven year old he came to the curate of palestrina and asked to be taught to read it was somewhat difficult for he could not quit his flock but the good curate went every day to say mass at a little hamlet too poor to pay a priest and which having no other name was called borgo he told luigi_vampa that he might meet him on his return and that then he would give him a lesson warning him that it would be short and that he must profit as much as possible by it the child accepted joyfully
every day luigi_vampa led his flock to graze on the road that leads from palestrina to borgo every day at nine oâ clock in the morning the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside and the little shepherd took his lesson out of the priestâ breviary at the end of three month he had learned to read this was not enoughâ he must now learn to write the priest had a writing teacher at rome make three alphabetsâ one large one middling and one small and pointed out to him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the letter on a slate and thus learn to write the same evening when the flock was safe at the farm the little luigi_vampa hastened to the smith at palestrina took a large nail heated and sharpened it and formed a sort of stylus the next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and began at the end of three month he had learned to write the curate astonished at his quickness and intelligence made him a present of pens paper and a penknife this demanded new effort but nothing compared to the first at the end of a week he wrote as well with this pen as with the stylus the curate related the incident to the count of san felice who sent for the little shepherd made him read and write before him ordered his attendant to let him eat with the domestics and to give him two piastres a month with this luigi_vampa purchased books and pencils he applied his imitative powers to everything and like giotto when young he drew on his slate sheep house and trees
then with his knife he began to carve all sorts of objects in wood it was thus that pinelli the famous sculptor had commenced 20105m a girl of six or sevenâ that is a little younger than vampaâ tended sheep on a farm near palestrina she was an orphan born at valmontone and was named _teresa the two child met sat down near each other let their flocks mingle together played laughed and conversed together in the evening they separated the count of san feliceâ flock from those of baron cervetri and the child returned to their respective farms promising to meet the next morning the next day they kept their word and thus they grew up together luigi_vampa was twelve and _teresa eleven and yet their natural disposition revealed itself beside his taste for the fine arts which luigi_vampa had carried as far as he could in his solitude he was given to alternating fits of sadness and enthusiasm was often angry and capricious and always sarcastic none of the lads of pampinara palestrina or valmontone had been able to gain any influence over him or even to become his companion his disposition always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make them kept him aloof from all friendships _teresa alone ruled by a look a word a gesture this impetuous character which yielded beneath the hand of a woman and which beneath the hand of a man might have broken but could never have been bended _teresa was lively and gay but coquettish to excess the two piastres that luigi_vampa received every month from the count of san feliceâ steward and the price of all the little carvings in wood he sold at rome were expended in ear rings necklaces and gold hairpins
so that thanks to her friendâ generosity _teresa was the most beautiful and the best attired peasant near rome the two child grew up together passing all their time with each other and giving themselves up to the wild idea of their different characters thus in all their dreams their wishes and their conversations luigi_vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel general of an army or governor of a province _teresa saw herself rich superbly attired and attended by a train of liveried domestics then when they had thus passed the day in building castles in the air they separated their flocks and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the reality of their humble position one day the young shepherd told the countâ steward that he had seen a wolf come out of the sabine mountains and prowl around his flock the steward gave him a gun this was what luigi_vampa longed for this gun had an excellent barrel made at brescia and carrying a ball with the precision of an english rifle but one day the count broke the stock and had then cast the gun aside this however was nothing to a sculptor like luigi_vampa he examined the broken stock calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder and made a fresh stock so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres had he chosen to sell it but nothing could be farther from his thoughts for a long time a gun had been the young manâ greatest ambition
in every country where independence has taken the place of liberty the first desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon which at once renders him capable of defence or attack and by rendering its owner terrible often makes him feared from this moment luigi_vampa devoted all his leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious weapon he purchased powder and ball and everything served him for a markâ the trunk of some old and moss grown olive tree that grew on the sabine mountains the fox as he quitted his earth on some marauding excursion the eagle that soared above their head and thus he soon became so expert that _teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at the report and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever he pleased with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand 20107 â one evening a wolf emerged from a pine wood near which they were usually stationed but the wolf had scarcely advanced ten yards ere he was dead proud of this exploit luigi_vampa took the dead animal on his shoulders and carried him to the farm these exploits had gained luigi_vampa considerable reputation the man of superior abilities always finds admirers go where he will he was spoken of as the most adroit the strongest and the most courageous contadino for ten leagues around and although _teresa was universally allowed to be the most beautiful girl of the sabines no one had ever spoken to her of love because it was known that she was beloved by luigi_vampa and yet the two young people had never declared their affection they had grown together like two trees whose roots are mingled whose branches intertwined and whose intermingled perfume rises to the heavens
only their wish to see each other had become a necessity and they would have preferred death to a dayâ separation _teresa was sixteen and luigi_vampa seventeen about this time a band of brigands that had established itself in the lepini mountains began to be much spoken of the brigands have never been really extirpated from the neighborhood of rome sometimes a chief is wanted but when a chief presents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of followers the celebrated cucumetto pursued in the abruzzo driven out of the kingdom of naples where he had carried on a regular war had crossed the garigliano like manfred and had taken refuge on the banks of the amasine between sonnino and juperno he strove to collect a band of followers and followed the footsteps of decesaris and gasparone whom he hoped to surpass many young man of palestrina frascati and pampinara had disappeared their disappearance at first caused much disquietude but it was soon known that they had joined cucumetto after some time cucumetto became the object of universal attention the most extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were related of him one day he carried off a young girl the daughter of a surveyor of frosinone the banditâ laws are positive a young girl belongs first to him who carries her off then the rest draw lots for her and she is abandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings when their parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom a messenger is sent to negotiate the prisoner is hostage for the security of the messenger should the ransom be refused the prisoner is irrevocably lost the young girlâ lover was in cucumettoâ troop his name was carlini
when she recognized her lover the poor girl extended her arm to him and believed herself safe but carlini felt his heart sink for he but too well knew the fate that awaited her however as he was a favorite with cucumetto as he had for three year faithfully served him and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down he hoped the chief would have pity on him he took cucumetto one side while the young girl seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest made a veil of her picturesque head dress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits there he told the chief allâ his affection for the prisoner their promises of mutual fidelity and how every night since he had been near they had met in some neighboring ruins 20109m â_it so happened that night that cucumetto had sent carlini to a village so that he had been unable to go to the place of meeting cucumetto had been there however by accident as he said and had carried the maiden off carlini besought his chief to make an exception in ritaâ favor as her father was rich and could pay a large ransom cucumetto seemed to yield to his friendâ entreaties and bade him find a shepherd to send to ritaâ father at frosinone carlini flew joyfully to rita telling her she was saved and bidding her write to her father to inform him what had occurred and that her ransom was fixed at three hundred piastres twelve hoursâ delay was all that was grantedâ that is until nine the next morning
the instant the letter was written carlini seized it and hastened to the plain to find a messenger he found a young shepherd watching his flock the natural messengers of the bandits are the shepherds who live between the city and the mountains between civilized and savage life the boy undertook the commission promising to be in frosinone in less than an hour carlini returned anxious to see his mistress and announce the joyful intelligence he found the troop in the glade supping off the provisions exacted as contributions from the peasants but his eye vainly sought rita and cucumetto among them he inquired where they were and was answered by a burst of laughter a cold perspiration burst from every pore and his hair stood on end he repeated his question one of the bandits rose and offered him a glass filled with orvietto saying to the health of the brave cucumetto and the fair rita at this moment carlini heard a womanâ cry he divined the truth seized the glass broke it across the face of him who presented it and rushed towards the spot whence the cry came after a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket he found rita senseless in the arm of cucumetto at the sight of carlini cucumetto rose a pistol in each hand the two brigands looked at each other for a momentâ the one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lip the other with the pallor of death on his brow a terrible battle between the two man seemed imminent but by degrees carliniâ features relaxed his hand which had grasped one of the pistols in his belt fell to his side rita lay between them the moon lighted the group
â well said cucumetto have you executed your commission â â_yes captain returned carlini at nine oâ clock tomorrow ritaâ father will be here with the money â â_it is well in the meantime we will have a merry night this young girl is charming and does credit to your taste now as i am not egotistical we will return to our comrades and draw lots for her â you have determined then to abandon her to the common law said carlini â why should an exception be made in her favor â i thought that my entreatiesâ â â what right have you any more than the rest to ask for an exception â â_it is true â but never mind continued cucumetto laughing sooner or later your turn will come carliniâ teeth clenched convulsively â now then said cucumetto advancing towards the other bandits are you coming â i follow you 20111m cucumetto departed without losing sight of carlini for doubtless he feared lest he should strike him unawares but nothing betrayed a hostile design on carliniâ part he was standing his arm folded near rita who was still insensible cucumetto fancied for a moment the young man was about to take her in his arm and fly but this mattered little to him now rita had been his and as for the money three hundred piastres distributed among the band was so small a sum that he cared little about it he continued to follow the path to the glade but to his great surprise carlini arrived almost as soon as himself â let us draw lots let us draw lots cried all the brigands when they saw the chief their demand was fair and the chief inclined his head in sign of acquiescence
the eye of all shone fiercely as they made their demand and the red light of the fire made them look like demons the name of all including carlini were placed in a hat and the youngest of the band drew forth a ticket the ticket bore the name of diavolaccio he was the man who had proposed to carlini the health of their chief and to whom carlini replied by breaking the glass across his face a large wound extending from the temple to the mouth was bleeding profusely diavolaccio seeing himself thus favored by fortune burst into a loud laugh â captain said he just now carlini would not drink your health when i proposed it to him propose mine to him and let us see if he will be more condescending to you than to me â everyone expected an explosion on carliniâ part but to their great surprise he took a glass in one hand and a flask in the other and filling it â your health diavolaccio said he calmly and he drank it off without his hand trembling in the least then sitting down by the fire my supper said he my expedition has given me an appetite â well done carlini cried the brigands that is acting like a good fellow and they all formed a circle round the fire while diavolaccio disappeared carlini ate and drank as if nothing had happened the bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps they turned round and saw diavolaccio bearing the young girl in his arm her head hung back and her long hair swept the ground as they entered the circle the bandits could perceive by the firelight the unearthly pallor of the young girl and of diavolaccio
this apparition was so strange and so solemn that everyone rose with the exception of carlini who remained seated and ate and drank calmly diavolaccio advanced amidst the most profound silence and laid rita at the captainâ foot then everyone could understand the cause of the unearthly pallor in the young girl and the bandit a knife was plunged up to the hilt in ritaâ left breast everyone looked at carlini the sheath at his belt was empty â ah ah said the chief i now understand why carlini stayed behind â all savage natures appreciate a desperate deed no other of the bandits would perhaps have done the same but they all understood what carlini had done â now then cried carlini rising in his turn and approaching the corpse his hand on the butt of one of his pistols does anyone dispute the possession of this woman with me â no returned the chief she is thine â carlini raised her in his arm and carried her out of the circle of firelight cucumetto placed his sentinels for the night and the bandits wrapped themselves in their cloaks and lay down before the fire at midnight the sentinel gave the alarm and in an instant all were on the alert it was ritaâ father who brought his daughterâ ransom in person â here said he to cucumetto here are three hundred piastres give me back my child but the chief without taking the money made a sign to him to follow the old man obeyed they both advanced beneath the trees through whose branches streamed the moonlight cucumetto stopped at last and pointed to two person grouped at the foot of a tree â there
â said he demand thy child of carlini he will tell thee what has become of her and he returned to his companions the old man remained motionless he felt that some great and unforeseen misfortune hung over his head at length he advanced toward the group the meaning of which he could not comprehend as he approached carlini raised his head and the forms of two person became visible to the old manâ eye a woman lay on the ground her head resting on the knees of a man who was seated by her as he raised his head the womanâ face became visible the old man recognized his child and carlini recognized the old man â i expected thee said the bandit to ritaâ father â wretch returned the old man what hast thou done and he gazed with terror on rita pale and bloody a knife buried in her bosom a ray of moonlight poured through the trees and lighted up the face of the dead â cucumetto had violated thy daughter said the bandit i loved her therefore i slew her for she would have served as the sport of the whole band the old man spoke not and grew pale as death now continued carlini if i have done wrongly avenge her and withdrawing the knife from the wound in ritaâ bosom he held it out to the old man with one hand while with the other he tore open his vest â thou hast done well returned the old man in a hoarse voice embrace me my son 20115m carlini threw himself sobbing like a child into the arm of his mistressâ father these were the first tears the man of blood had ever wept â now said the old man aid me to bury my child
carlini fetched two pickaxes and the father and the lover began to dig at the foot of a huge oak beneath which the young girl was to repose when the grave was formed the father embraced her first and then the lover afterwards one taking the head the other the foot they placed her in the grave then they knelt on each side of the grave and said the prayers of the dead then when they had finished they cast the earth over the corpse until the grave was filled then extending his hand the old man said i thank you my son and now leave me alone â yetâ â replied carlini â leave me i command you â carlini obeyed rejoined his comrades folded himself in his cloak and soon appeared to sleep as soundly as the rest it had been resolved the night before to change their encampment an hour before daybreak cucumetto aroused his man and gave the word to march but carlini would not quit the forest without knowing what had become of ritaâ father he went toward the place where he had left him he found the old man suspended from one of the branches of the oak which shaded his daughterâ grave he then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead body of the one and the tomb of the other but he was unable to complete this oath for two day afterwards in an encounter with the roman carbineers carlini was killed there was some surprise however that as he was with his face to the enemy he should have received a ball between his shoulders that astonishment ceased when one of the brigands remarked to his comrades that cucumetto was stationed ten paces in carliniâ rear when he fell
on the morning of the departure from the forest of frosinone he had followed carlini in the darkness and heard this oath of vengeance and like a wise man anticipated it they told ten other stories of this bandit chief each more singular than the other thus from fondi to perusia everyone trembles at the name of cucumetto these narratives were frequently the theme of conversation between luigi_vampa and _teresa the young girl trembled very much at hearing the stories but luigi_vampa reassured her with a smile tapping the butt of his good fowling piece which threw its ball so well and if that did not restore her courage he pointed to a crow perched on some dead branch took aim touched the trigger and the bird fell dead at the foot of the tree time passed on and the two young people had agreed to be married when luigi_vampa should be twenty and _teresa nineteen year of age they were both orphans and had only their employersâ leave to ask which had been already sought and obtained one day when they were talking over their plans for the future they heard two or three reports of firearms and then suddenly a man came out of the wood near which the two young person used to graze their flocks and hurried towards them when he came within hearing he exclaimed i am pursued can you conceal me â they knew full well that this fugitive must be a bandit but there is an innate sympathy between the roman brigand and the roman peasant and the latter is always ready to aid the former
vampa without saying a word hastened to the stone that closed up the entrance to their grotto drew it away made a sign to the fugitive to take refuge there in a retreat unknown to everyone closed the stone upon him and then went and resumed his seat by _teresa instantly afterwards four carbineers on horseback appeared on the edge of the wood three of them appeared to be looking for the fugitive while the fourth dragged a brigand prisoner by the neck the three carbineers looked about carefully on every side saw the young peasants and galloping up began to question them they had seen no one â that is very annoying said the brigadier for the man we are looking for is the chief â cucumetto cried luigi_vampa and _teresa at the same moment â_yes replied the brigadier and as his head is valued at a thousand roman crowns there would have been five hundred for you if you had helped us to catch him the two young person exchanged look the brigadier had a momentâ hope five hundred roman crowns are three thousand lire and three thousand lire are a fortune for two poor orphans who are going to be married â_yes it is very annoying said luigi_vampa but we have not seen him â then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions but in vain then after a time they disappeared luigi_vampa then removed the stone and cucumetto came out through the crevices in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers and guessed the subject of their parley he had read in the countenances of luigi_vampa and _teresa their steadfast resolution not to surrender him and he drew from his pocket a purse full of gold which he offered to them
but luigi_vampa raised his head proudly as to _teresa her eye sparkled when she thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of gold cucumetto was a cunning fiend and had assumed the form of a brigand instead of a serpent and this look from _teresa showed to him that she was a worthy daughter of eve and he returned to the forest pausing several time on his way under the pretext of saluting his protectors several day elapsed and they neither saw nor heard of cucumetto the time of the carnival was at hand the count of san felice announced a grand masked ball to which all that were distinguished in rome were invited _teresa had a great desire to see this ball luigi_vampa asked permission of his protector the steward that she and he might be present amongst the servant of the house_of_peers this was granted the ball was given by the count for the particular pleasure of his daughter carmela whom he adored carmela was precisely the age and figure of _teresa and _teresa was as handsome as carmela on the evening of the ball _teresa was attired in her best her most brilliant ornaments in her hair and gayest glass beads she was in the costume of the woman of frascati luigi_vampa wore the very picturesque garb of the roman peasant at holiday time they both mingled as they had leave to do with the servant and peasants the festa was magnificent not only was the villa brilliantly illuminated but thousands of colored lanterns were suspended from the trees in the garden and very soon the palace overflowed to the terraces and the terraces to the garden walks
at each cross path was an orchestra and tables spread with refreshments the guests stopped formed quadrilles and danced in any part of the grounds they pleased carmela was attired like a woman of sonnino her cap was embroidered with pearls the pins in her hair were of gold and diamonds her girdle was of turkey silk with large embroidered flowers her bodice and skirt were of cashmere her apron of indian muslin and the buttons of her corset were of jewels two of her companions were dressed the one as a woman of nettuno and the other as a woman of la riccia four young man of the richest and noblest families of rome accompanied them with that italian freedom which has not its parallel in any other country in the world they were attired as peasants of albano velletri civita castellana and sora we need hardly add that these peasant costumes like those of the young woman were brilliant with gold and jewels carmela wished to form a quadrille but there was one lady wanting carmela looked all around her but not one of the guests had a costume similar to her own or those of her companions the count of san felice pointed out _teresa who was hanging on luigiâ arm in a group of peasants â will you allow me father said carmela â certainly replied the count are we not in carnival time â carmela turned towards the young man who was talking with her and saying a few word to him pointed with her finger to _teresa the young man looked bowed in obedience and then went to _teresa and invited her to dance in a quadrille directed by the countâ daughter _teresa felt a flush pass over her face she looked at luigi_vampa who could not refuse his assent
luigi slowly relinquished teresaâ arm which he had held beneath his own and _teresa accompanied by her elegant cavalier took her appointed place with much agitation in the aristocratic quadrille certainly in the eye of an artist the exact and strict costume of _teresa had a very different character from that of carmela and her companions and _teresa was frivolous and coquettish and thus the embroidery and muslins the cashmere waist girdles all dazzled her and the reflection of sapphires and diamonds almost turned her giddy brain luigi_vampa felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his mind it was like an acute pain which gnawed at his heart and then thrilled through his whole body he followed with his eye each movement of _teresa and her cavalier when their hand touched he felt as though he should swoon every pulse beat with violence and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his ears when they spoke although _teresa listened timidly and with downcast eye to the conversation of her cavalier as luigi_vampa could read in the ardent look of the good looking young man that his language was that of praise it seemed as if the whole world was turning round with him and all the voice of hell were whispering in his ears idea of murder and assassination then fearing that his paroxysm might get the better of him he clutched with one hand the branch of a tree against which he was leaning and with the other convulsively grasped the dagger with a carved handle which was in his belt and which unwittingly he drew from the scabbard from time to time luigi_vampa was jealous he felt that influenced by her ambitions and coquettish disposition _teresa might escape him
â the young peasant girl at first timid and scared soon recovered herself we have said that _teresa was handsome but this is not all _teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more potent than our affected and studied elegancies she had almost all the honor of the quadrille and if she were envious of the count of san feliceâ daughter we will not undertake to say that carmela was not jealous of her and with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her and where luigi_vampa awaited her twice or thrice during the dance the young girl had glanced at luigi_vampa and each time she saw that he was pale and that his features were agitated once even the blade of his knife half drawn from its sheath had dazzled her eye with its sinister glare thus it was almost tremblingly that she resumed her loverâ arm the quadrille had been most perfect and it was evident there was a great demand for a repetition carmela alone objecting to it but the count of san felice besought his daughter so earnestly that she acceded one of the cavaliers then hastened to invite _teresa without whom it was impossible for the quadrille to be formed but the young girl had disappeared the truth was that luigi_vampa had not felt the strength to support another such trial and half by persuasion and half by force he had removed _teresa toward another part of the garden _teresa had yielded in spite of herself but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young man she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something strange was passing within him
she herself was not exempt from internal emotion and without having done anything wrong yet fully comprehended that luigi_vampa was right in reproaching her why she did not know but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches were merited however to teresaâ great astonishment luigi_vampa remained mute and not a word escaped his lip the rest of the evening when the chill of the night had driven away the guests from the gardens and the gates of the villa were closed on them for the festa in door he took _teresa quite away and as he left her at her home he said â _teresa what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young countess of san felice â i thought replied the young girl with all the frankness of her nature that i would give half my life for a costume such as she wore â and what said your cavalier to you â he said it only depended on myself to have it and i had only one word to say â he was right said luigi_vampa do you desire it as ardently as you say â â_yes â well then you shall have it â the young girl much astonished raised her head to look at him but his face was so gloomy and terrible that her word froze to her lip as luigi_vampa spoke thus he left her _teresa followed him with her eye into the darkness as long as she could and when he had quite disappeared she went into the house_of_peers with a sigh 20121m that night a memorable event occurred due no doubt to the imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the light the villa of san felice took fire in the room adjoining the very apartment of the lovely carmela
awakened in the night by the light of the flames she sprang out of bed wrapped herself in a dressing gown and attempted to escape by the door but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already a prey to the flames she then returned to her room calling for help as loudly as she could when suddenly her window which was twenty foot from the ground was opened a young peasant jumped into the chamber seized her in his arm and with superhuman skill and strength conveyed her to the turf of the grass plot where she fainted when she recovered her father was by her side all the servant surrounded her offering her assistance an entire wing of the villa was burnt down but what of that as long as carmela was safe and uninjured her preserver was everywhere sought for but he did not appear he was inquired after but no one had seen him carmela was greatly troubled that she had not recognized him as the count was immensely rich excepting the danger carmela had run and the marvellous manner in which she had escaped made that appear to him rather a favor of providence than a real misfortune the loss occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle the next day at the usual hour the two young peasants were on the borders of the forest luigi_vampa arrived first he came toward _teresa in high spirits and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the previous evening the young girl was very pensive but seeing luigi_vampa so cheerful she on her part assumed a smiling air which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion
â luigi_vampa took her arm beneath his own and led her to the door of the grotto then he paused the young girl perceiving that there was something extraordinary looked at him steadfastly â _teresa said luigi_vampa yesterday evening you told me you would give all the world to have a costume similar to that of the countâ daughter â â_yes replied _teresa with astonishment but i was mad to utter such a wish â and i replied very well you shall have it â â_yes replied the young girl whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by luigi_vampa but of course your reply was only to please me â i have promised no more than i have given you _teresa said luigi_vampa proudly go into the grotto and dress yourself â at these word he drew away the stone and showed _teresa the grotto lighted up by two wax light which burnt on each side of a splendid mirror on a rustic table made by luigi_vampa were spread out the pearl necklace and the diamond pins and on a chair at the side was laid the rest of the costume _teresa uttered a cry of joy and without inquiring whence this attire came or even thanking luigi_vampa darted into the grotto transformed into a dressing room luigi_vampa pushed the stone behind her for on the crest of a small adjacent hill which cut off the view toward palestrina he saw a traveller on horseback stopping a moment as if uncertain of his road and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is peculiar to distant objects in southern climes when he saw luigi_vampa he put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him luigi_vampa was not mistaken
the traveller who was going from palestrina to tivoli had mistaken his way the young man directed him but as at a distance of a quarter of a mile the road again divided into three way and on reaching these the traveller might again stray from his route he begged luigi_vampa to be his guide luigi_vampa threw his cloak on the ground placed his carbine on his shoulder and freed from his heavy covering preceded the traveller with the rapid step of a mountaineer which a horse can scarcely keep up with in ten minute luigi_vampa and the traveller reached the cross roads on arriving there with an air as majestic as that of an emperor he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to follow â that is your road excellency and now you cannot again mistake â and here is your recompense said the traveller offering the young herdsman some small pieces of money â thank you said luigi_vampa drawing back his hand i render a service i do not sell it â well replied the traveller who seemed used to this difference between the servility of a man of the cities and the pride of the mountaineer if you refuse wages you will perhaps accept a gift â ah yes that is another thing â then said the traveller take these two venetian sequins and give them to your bride to make herself a pair of earrings â and then do you take this poniard said the young herdsman you will not find one better carved between albano and civita castellana â i accept it answered the traveller
â but then the obligation will be on my side for this poniard is worth more than two sequins â for a dealer perhaps but for me who engraved it myself it is hardly worth a piastre â what is your name inquired the traveller â luigi_vampa replied the shepherd with the same air as he would have replied alexander_vi king of macedon and yours â i said the traveller am called sinbad the sailor â m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay started with surprise sinbad the sailor he said â_yes replied the narrator that was the name which the traveller gave to luigi_vampa as his own â well and what may you have to say against this name inquired monsieur_albert â_it is a very pretty name and the adventures of the gentleman of that name amused me very much in my youth i must confess m_franz_de_quesnel said no more the name of sinbad the sailor as may well be supposed awakened in him a world of recollections as had the name of the count_of_monte_cristo on the previous evening proceed said he to the host luigi_vampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket and slowly returned by the way he had gone as he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto he thought he heard a cry he listened to know whence this sound could proceed a moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced distinctly the cry proceeded from the grotto he bounded like a chamois cocking his carbine as he went and in a moment reached the summit of a hill opposite to that on which he had perceived the traveller three cries for help came more distinctly to his ear
he cast his eye around him and saw a man carrying off _teresa as nessus the centaur carried deianira this man who was hastening towards the wood was already three quarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the forest luigi_vampa measured the distance the man was at least two hundred paces in advance of him and there was not a chance of overtaking him the young shepherd stopped as if his foot had been rooted to the ground then he put the butt of his carbine to his shoulder took aim at the ravisher followed him for a second in his track and then fired the ravisher stopped suddenly his knees bent under him and he fell with _teresa in his arm the young girl rose instantly but the man lay on the earth struggling in the agonies of death luigi_vampa then rushed towards _teresa for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed her and she had dropped on her knees so that the young man feared that the ball that had brought down his enemy had also wounded his betrothed fortunately she was unscathed and it was fright alone that had overcome _teresa when luigi_vampa had assured himself that she was safe and unharmed he turned towards the wounded man he had just expired with clenched hand his mouth in a spasm of agony and his hair on end in the sweat of death his eye remained open and menacing luigi_vampa approached the corpse and recognized cucumetto from the day on which the bandit had been saved by the two young peasants he had been enamoured of _teresa and had sworn she should be his
from that time he had watched them and profiting by the moment when her lover had left her alone had carried her off and believed he at length had her in his power when the ball directed by the unerring skill of the young herdsman had pierced his heart luigi_vampa gazed on him for a moment without betraying the slightest emotion while on the contrary _teresa shuddering in every limb dared not approach the slain ruffian but by degrees and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the shoulder of her lover suddenly luigi_vampa turned toward his mistress â ah said heâ good good you are dressed it is now my turn to dress myself 20125m _teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the count of san feliceâ daughter luigi_vampa took cucumettoâ body in his arm and conveyed it to the grotto while in her turn _teresa remained outside if a second traveller had passed he would have seen a strange thing a shepherdess watching her flock clad in a cashmere grown with ear rings and necklace of pearls diamond pins and buttons of sapphires emeralds and rubies he would no doubt have believed that he had returned to the time of florian and would have declared on reaching paris that he had met an alpine shepherdess seated at the foot of the sabine hill at the end of a quarter of an hour luigi_vampa quitted the grotto his costume was no less elegant than that of _teresa
he wore a vest of garnet colored velvet with buttons of cut gold a silk waistcoat covered with embroidery a roman scarf tied round his neck a cartridge box worked with gold and red and green silk sky blue velvet breeches fastened above the knee with diamond buckles garters of deerskin worked with a thousand arabesques and a hat whereon hung ribbons of all colors two watches hung from his girdle and a splendid poniard was in his belt _teresa uttered a cry of admiration luigi_vampa in this attire resembled a painting by lã opold robert or schnetz he had assumed the entire costume of cucumetto the young man saw the effect produced on his betrothed and a smile of pride passed over his lip â now he said to _teresa are you ready to share my fortune whatever it may be â â_oh yes exclaimed the young girl enthusiastically â and follow me wherever i go â to the worldâ end â then take my arm and let us on we have no time to lose â the young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he was conducting her for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome proud and powerful as a god they went towards the forest and soon entered it we need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known to luigi_vampa he therefore went forward without a momentâ hesitation although there was no beaten track but he knew his path by looking at the trees and bushes and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an hour and a half at the end of this time they had reached the thickest part of the forest a torrent whose bed was dry led into a deep gorge
vampa took this wild road which enclosed between two ridges and shadowed by the tufted umbrage of the pines seemed but for the difficulties of its descent that path to avernus of which virgil speaks _teresa had become alarmed at the wild and deserted look of the plain around her and pressed closely against her guide not uttering a syllable but as she saw him advance with even step and composed countenance she endeavored to repress her emotion suddenly about ten paces from them a man advanced from behind a tree and aimed at luigi_vampa â not another step he said or you are a dead man â what then said luigi_vampa raising his hand with a gesture of disdain while _teresa no longer able to restrain her alarm clung closely to him do wolves rend each other â who are you inquired the sentinel â i am luigi_vampa shepherd of the san felice farm â what do you want â i would speak with your companions who are in the glade at rocca bianca â follow me then said the sentinel or as you know your way go first â luigi_vampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the bandit went before _teresa and continued to advance with the same firm and easy step as before at the end of ten minute the bandit made them a sign to stop the two young person obeyed then the bandit thrice imitated the cry of a crow a croak answered this signal â good said the sentry you may now go on â luigi_vampa and _teresa again set forward as they went on _teresa clung tremblingly to her lover at the sight of weapons and the glistening of carbines through the trees
the retreat of rocca bianca was at the top of a small mountain which no doubt in former day had been a volcanoâ an extinct volcano before the day when remus and romulus had deserted alba to come and found the city of rome _teresa and luigi_vampa reached the summit and all at once found themselves in the presence of twenty bandits â here is a young man who seeks and wishes to speak to you said the sentinel â what has he to say inquired the young man who was in command in the chiefâ absence â i wish to say that i am tired of a shepherdâ life was vampaâ reply â ah i understand said the lieutenant and you seek admittance into our ranks â welcome cried several bandits from ferrusino pampinara and anagni who had recognized luigi_vampa â_yes but i came to ask something more than to be your companion â and what may that be inquired the bandits with astonishment â i come to ask to be your captain said the young man the bandits shouted with laughter â and what have you done to aspire to this honor demanded the lieutenant â i have killed your chief cucumetto whose dress i now wear and i set fire to the villa san felice to procure a wedding dress for my betrothed â an hour afterwards luigi_vampa was chosen captain vice cucumetto deceased 20129m well my dear monsieur_albert said m_franz_de_quesnel turning towards his friend what think you of citizen luigi_vampa â i say he is a myth replied monsieur_albert and never had an existence â and what may a myth be inquired signor_pastrini the explanation would be too long my dear landlord replied m_franz_de_quesnel and
you say that signor luigi_vampa exercises his profession at this moment in the environs of rome â and with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an example â then the police have vainly tried to lay hand on him â why you see he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the plains the fishermen of the tiber and the smugglers of the coast they seek for him in the mountains and he is on the waters they follow him on the waters and he is on the open sea then they pursue him and he has suddenly taken refuge in the islands at giglio giannutri or count_of_monte_cristo and when they hunt for him there he reappears suddenly at albano tivoli or la riccia â and how does he behave towards travellers â alas his plan is very simple it depends on the distance he may be from the city whether he gives eight hour twelve hour or a day wherein to pay their ransom and when that time has elapsed he allows another hourâ grace at the sixtieth minute of this hour if the money is not forthcoming he blows out the prisonerâ brains with a pistol shot or plants his dagger in his heart and that settles the account â well monsieur_albert inquired m_franz_de_quesnel of his companion are you still disposed to go to the colosseum by the outer wall â quite so said monsieur_albert if the way be picturesque the clock struck nine as the door opened and a coachman appeared excellencies said he the coach is ready â well then said m_franz_de_quesnel let us to the colosseum â by the porta del popolo or by the streets your excellencies â by the streets morbleu by the streets cried m_franz_de_quesnel
â ah my dear fellow said monsieur_albert rising and lighting his third cigar really i thought you had more courage so saying the two young man went down the staircase and got into the carriage 20131 chapter 34 the colosseum m_franz_de_quesnel had so managed his route that during the ride to the colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin so that no preliminary impression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to admire the road selected was a continuation of the via sistina then by cutting off the right angle of the street in which stands santa maria maggiore and proceeding by the via urbana and san pietro in vincoli the travellers would find themselves directly opposite the colosseum this itinerary possessed another great advantage that of leaving m_franz_de_quesnel at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of signor pastriniâ story in which his mysterious host of count_of_monte_cristo was so strangely mixed up seated with folded arm in a corner of the carriage he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately listened to and to ask himself an interminable number of questions touching its various circumstances without however arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of them one fact more than the rest brought his friend sinbad the sailorâ back to his recollection and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors and pastriniâ account of vampaâ having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers and fishermen reminded m_franz_de_quesnel of the two corsican bandits he had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht which had even deviated from its course and touched at porto vecchio for the sole purpose of landing them
the very name assumed by his host of count_of_monte_cristo and again repeated by the landlord of the hã tel de londres abundantly proved to him that his island friend was playing his philanthropic part on the shores of piombino civita vecchia ostia and gaã ta as on those of corsica tuscany and spain and further m_franz_de_quesnel bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer speak both of tunis and palermo proving thereby how largely his circle of acquaintances extended but however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these reflections they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark frowning ruins of the stupendous colosseum through the various openings of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly gleam from the eye of the wandering dead the carriage stopped near the meta sudans the door was opened and the young man eagerly alighting found themselves opposite a cicerone who appeared to have sprung up from the ground so unexpected was his appearance the usual guide from the hotel having followed them they had paid two conductors nor is it possible at rome to avoid this abundant supply of guides besides the ordinary cicerone who seizes upon you directly you set foot in your hotel and never quits you while you remain in the city there is also a special cicerone belonging to each monumentâ nay almost to each part of a monument
it may therefore be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the colosseum that wonder of all ages which martial thus eulogizes let memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids and the wonders of babylon be talked of no more among us all must bow to the superiority of the gigantic labor of the cã sars and the many voice of fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable monument as for monsieur_albert and m_franz_de_quesnel they essayed not to escape from their ciceronian tyrants and indeed it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their hand thus then the young man made no attempt at resistance but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors m_franz_de_quesnel had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the colosseum while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the classic ground forming the monument of flavius vespasian and to his credit be it spoken his mind even amid the glib loquacity of the guides was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he saw and certainly no adequate notion of these stupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them and more especially by moonlight at which time the vast proportions of the building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern moonlit sky whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western clime scarcely therefore had the reflective m_franz_de_quesnel walked a hundred step beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin
when abandoning monsieur_albert to the guides who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down and as regularly followed by them but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal beginning as a matter of course with the lionsâ denâ the hall of the gladiatorsâ and finishing with cã sarâ podiumâ to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded m_franz_de_quesnel ascended a half dilapidated staircase and leaving them to follow their monotonous round seated himself at the foot of a column and immediately opposite a large aperture which permitted him to enjoy a full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin m_franz_de_quesnel had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a resting place and from whence his eye followed the motions of monsieur_albert and his guides who holding torches in their hand had emerged from a vomitorium at the opposite extremity of the colosseum and then again disappeared down the step conducting to the seats reserved for the vestal virgins resembling as they glided along some restless shades following the flickering glare of so many ignes fatui all at once his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself ascended
there was nothing remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily below but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave way beneath the pressure of a foot and also that someone who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard was approaching the spot where he sat conjecture soon became certainty for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to m_franz_de_quesnel gradually emerging from the staircase opposite upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery brightness the stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who like m_franz_de_quesnel preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the guides and his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it but the hesitation with which he proceeded stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took convinced m_franz_de_quesnel that he expected the arrival of some person by a sort of instinctive impulse m_franz_de_quesnel withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar about ten foot from the spot where he and the stranger were the roof had given way leaving a large round opening through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven thickly studded with stars around this opening which had possibly for ages permitted a free entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile grew a quantity of creeping plants whose delicate green branches stood out in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament while large masses of thick strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the chasm and hung floating to and fro like so many waving strings
the person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of m_franz_de_quesnel stood in a kind of half light that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features although his dress was easily made out he wore a large brown mantle one fold of which thrown over his left shoulder served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance while the upper part was completely hidden by his broad brimmed hat the lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon which entering through the broken ceiling shed their refulgent beams on foot cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black cloth 20135m from the imperfect means m_franz_de_quesnel had of judging he could only come to one conclusion that the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of life some few minute had elapsed and the stranger began to show manifest signs of impatience when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture in the roof and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct the flood of light that had entered it and the figure of a man was clearly seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him then as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle he grasped a floating mass of thickly matted boughs and glided down by their help to within three or four foot of the ground and then leaped lightly on his foot the man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the transtevere costume i beg your excellencyâ pardon for keeping you waiting said the man in the roman dialect but
i donâ think iâ many minute after my time ten oâ clock has just struck by the clock of saint john lateran â say not a word about being late replied the stranger in purest tuscan â tis i who am too soon but even if you had caused me to wait a little while i should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours â your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking said the man i came here direct from the castle of st angelo and i had an immense deal of trouble before i could get a chance to speak to beppo â and who is beppo â_oh beppo is employed in the prison and i give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his holinessâ castle â indeed you are a provident person i see â why you see no one knows what may happen perhaps some of these day i may be entrapped like poor peppino and may be very glad to have some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net and so help me out of prison â briefly what did you learn â that two executions of considerable interest will take place the day after tomorrow at two oâ clock as is customary at rome at the commencement of all great festivals one of the culprits will be mazzolato he is an atrocious villain who murdered the priest who brought him up and deserves not the smallest pity the other sufferer is sentenced to be decapitato and he your excellency is poor peppino
â the fact is that you have inspired not only the pontifical government but also the neighboring states with such extreme fear that they are glad of all opportunity of making an example â but peppino did not even belong to my band he was merely a poor shepherd whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with provisions â which makes him your accomplice to all intents and purposes but mark the distinction with which he is treated instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you he is simply sentenced to be guillotined by which means too the amusements of the day are diversified and there is a spectacle to please every spectator â without reckoning the wholly unexpected one i am preparing to surprise them with â my good friend said the man in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act â perhaps i am but one thing i have resolved on and that is to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty who has got into this scrape solely from having served me i should hate and despise myself as a coward did i desert the brave fellow in his present extremity â and what do you mean to do â to surround the scaffold with twenty of my best man who at a signal from me will rush forward directly peppino is brought for execution and by the assistance of their stilettos drive back the guard and carry off the prisoner â that seems to me as hazardous as uncertain and convinces me that my scheme is far better than yours â and what is your excellencyâ project â just this
i will so advantageously bestow 000 piastres that the person receiving them shall obtain a respite till next year for peppino and during that year another skilfully placed 000 piastres will afford him the means of escaping from his prison â and do you feel sure of succeeding â pardieu exclaimed the man in the cloak suddenly expressing himself in french what did your excellency say inquired the other i said my good fellow that i would do more single handed by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos pistols carbines and blunderbusses included leave me then to act and have no fears for the result â at least there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness in case your excellency should fail â none whatever take what precautions you please if it is any satisfaction to you to do so but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve i seek â remember the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow and that you have but one day to work in â and what of that is not a day divided into twenty four hour each hour into sixty minute and every minute sub divided into sixty seconds now in 86 400 seconds very many thing can be done â and how shall i know whether your excellency has succeeded or not â_oh that is very easily arranged
i have engaged the three lower window at the cafã rospoli should i have obtained the requisite pardon for peppino the two outside window will be hung with yellow damasks and the centre with white having a large cross in red marked on it â and whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing the execution â send one of your man disguised as a penitent friar and i will give it to him his dress will procure him the means of approaching the scaffold itself and he will deliver the official order to the officer who in his turn will hand it to the executioner in the meantime it will be as well to acquaint peppino with what we have determined on if it be only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses because in either case a very useless expense will have been incurred â your excellency said the man you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you are you not â nay i flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it replied the cavalier in the cloak
â well then only fulfil your promise of rescuing peppino and henceforward you shall receive not only devotion but the most absolute obedience from myself and those under me that one human being can render to another â have a care how far you pledge yourself my good friend for i may remind you of your promise at some perhaps not very distant period when i in my turn may require your aid and influence â let that day come sooner or later your excellency will find me what i have found you in this my heavy trouble and if from the other end of the world you but write me word to do such or such a thing you may regard it as done for done it shall be on the word and faith ofâ â hush interrupted the stranger i hear a noise â tis some travellers who are visiting the colosseum by torchlight â twere better we should not be seen together those guides are nothing but spies and might possibly recognize you and however i may be honored by your friendship my worthy friend if once the extent of our intimacy were known i am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit would suffer thereby â well then if you obtain the reprieve â the middle window at the cafã rospoli will be hung with white damask bearing a red cross â and if you fail â then all three window will have yellow draperies â and then â and then my good fellow use your daggers in any way you please and i further promise you to be there as a spectator of your prowess â we understand each other perfectly then
adieu your excellency depend upon me as firmly as i do upon you saying these word the transteverin disappeared down the staircase while his companion muffling his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle passed almost close to m_franz_de_quesnel and descended to the arena by an outward flight of step the next minute m_franz_de_quesnel heard himself called by monsieur_albert who made the lofty building re echo with the sound of his friendâ name m_franz_de_quesnel however did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two man whose conversation he had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his descent in ten minute after the strangers had departed m_franz_de_quesnel was on the road to the piazza di spagna listening with studied indifference to the learned dissertation delivered by monsieur_albert after the manner of pliny and calpurnius touching the iron pointed nets used to prevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators m_franz_de_quesnel let him proceed without interruption and in fact did not hear what was said he longed to be alone and free to ponder over all that had occurred one of the two man whose mysterious meeting in the colosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed was an entire stranger to him but not so the other and though m_franz_de_quesnel had been unable to distinguish his features from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the shadow the tone of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them hear them when or where he might
it was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting half bitter that franzâ ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous yet well pitched voice that had addressed him in the grotto of count_of_monte_cristo and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the colosseum and the more he thought the more entire was his conviction that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer sinbad the sailor 20139m under any other circumstances m_franz_de_quesnel would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance but in the present instance the confidential nature of the conversation he had overheard made him with propriety judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable as we have seen therefore he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance should chance afford him another opportunity in vain did m_franz_de_quesnel endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which assailed him in vain did he court the refreshment of sleep slumber refused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish contemplation of the chain of circumstances tending to prove the identity of the mysterious visitant to the colosseum with the inhabitant of the grotto of count_of_monte_cristo and the more he thought the firmer grew his opinion on the subject worn out at length he fell asleep at daybreak and did not awake till late
like a genuine frenchman monsieur_albert had employed his time in arranging for the eveningâ diversion he had sent to engage a box at the teatro argentina and m_franz_de_quesnel having a number of letter to write relinquished the carriage to monsieur_albert for the whole of the day at five oâ clock monsieur_albert returned delighted with his dayâ work he had been occupied in leaving his letter of introduction and had received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept besides this he had seen as he called it all the remarkable sights at rome yes in a single day he had accomplished what his more serious minded companion would have taken weeks to effect neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the teatro argentina and also what performers appeared in it the opera of parisina was announced for representation and the principal actors were coselli moriani and la specchia the young man therefore had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of lucia di lammermoor supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of italy monsieur_albert had never been able to endure the italian theatres with their orchestras from which it is impossible to see and the absence of balconies or open boxes all these defects pressed hard on a man who had had his stall at the bouffes and had shared a lower box at the opera
still in spite of this monsieur_albert displayed his most dazzling and effective costumes each time he visited the theatres but alas his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away and one of the most worthy representatives of parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun italy without meeting with a single adventure sometimes monsieur_albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success but internally he was deeply wounded and his self love immensely piqued to think that monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day should thus be passed over and merely have his labor for his pains and the thing was so much the more annoying as according to the characteristic modesty of a frenchman monsieur_albert had quitted paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in italy to carry all before him and that upon his return he should astonish the parisian world with the recital of his numerous love affairs alas poor monsieur_albert none of those interesting adventures fell in his way the lovely genoese florentines and neapolitans were all faithful if not to their husbands at least to their lovers and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of italy have this advantage over those of france that they are faithful even in their infidelity yet he could not restrain a hope that in italy as elsewhere there might be an exception to the general rule
albert besides being an elegant well looking young man was also possessed of considerable talent and ability moreover he was a viscountâ a recently created one certainly but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as noah in tracing a descent and a genealogical tree is equally estimated whether dated from 1399 or merely 1815 but to crown all these advantages monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf commanded an income of 50 000 livres a more than sufficient sum to render him a personage of considerable importance in paris it was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in italy without having excited the most trifling observation monsieur_albert however hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifferences during the carnival knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their life and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation the carnival was to commence on the morrow therefore monsieur_albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes expectations and claims to notice with this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet the box taken by monsieur_albert was in the first circle although each of the three tiers of boxes is deemed equally aristocratic and is for this reason generally styled the nobilityâ boxes
and although the box engaged for the two friend was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen person it had cost less than would be paid at some of the french theatres for one admitting merely four occupants another motive had influenced albertâ selection of his seat who knew but that thus advantageously placed he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair roman and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage or a place in a princely balcony from which he might behold the gayeties of the carnival these united considerations made monsieur_albert more lively and anxious to please than he had hitherto been totally disregarding the business of the stage he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman aided by a powerful opera glass but alas this attempt to attract notice wholly failed not even curiosity had been excited and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing were all so much engrossed with themselves their lovers or their own thoughts that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass the truth was that the anticipated pleasures of the carnival with the holy weekâ that was to succeed it so filled every fair breast as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the stage
the actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought of at certain conventional moment the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation or rouse themselves from their musings to listen to some brilliant effort of morianiâ a well executed recitative by coselli or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of la specchia but that momentary excitement over they quickly relapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting conversation towards the close of the first act the door of a box which had been hitherto vacant was opened a lady entered to whom m_franz_de_quesnel had been introduced in paris where indeed he had imagined she still was the quick eye of monsieur_albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new arrival and turning to him he said hastily do you know the woman who has just entered that box â_yes what do you think of her â_oh she is perfectly lovelyâ what a complexion and such magnificent hair is she french â no a venetian â and her name isâ â countess gâ â ah i know her by name exclaimed monsieur_albert she is said to possess as much wit and cleverness as beauty i was to have been presented to her when i met her at madame villefortâ ball â shall i assist you in repairing your negligence asked m_franz_de_quesnel my
dear fellow are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her box â why i have only had the honor of being in her society and conversing with her three or four time in my life but you know that even such an acquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask at that instant the countess perceived m_franz_de_quesnel and graciously waved her hand to him to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the head upon my word said monsieur_albert you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful countess â you are mistaken in thinking so returned m_franz_de_quesnel calmly but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to commit the most egregious blunders i mean that of judging the habits and customs of italy and spain by our parisian notions believe me nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among person by the familiar terms they seem upon there is a similarity of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countessâ nothing more â is there indeed my good fellow pray tell me is it sympathy of heart â no of taste continued m_franz_de_quesnel gravely and in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced â by the countessâ visiting the colosseum as we did last night by moonlight and nearly alone â you were with her then â i was â and
what did you say to her â_oh we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument â upon my word cried monsieur_albert you must have been a very entertaining companion alone or all but alone with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the colosseum and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead all i can say is if ever i should get such a chance the living should be my theme 20143m and you will probably find your theme ill chosen â but said monsieur_albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past let us only remember the present are you not going to keep your promise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks â certainly directly the curtain falls on the stage â what a confounded long time this first act lasts i believe on my soul that they never mean to finish it â_oh yes they will only listen to that charming finale how exquisitely coselli sings his part â but what an awkward inelegant fellow he is â well then what do you say to la specchia did you ever see anything more perfect than her acting â why you know my dear fellow when one has been accustomed to malibran and sontag such singers as these donâ make the same impression on you they perhaps do on others â at least you must admire morianiâ style and execution â i never fancied man of his dark ponderous appearance singing with a voice like a womanâ â my good friend said m_franz_de_quesnel turning to him while monsieur_albert continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre you seem determined not to approve you are really too difficult to please
the curtain at length fell on the performances to the infinite satisfaction of the viscount of viscount_albert_de_morcerf who seized his hat rapidly passed his fingers through his hair arranged his cravat and wristbands and signified to m_franz_de_quesnel that he was waiting for him to lead the way m_franz_de_quesnel who had mutely interrogated the countess and received from her a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome sought not to retard the gratification of albertâ eager impatience but began at once the tour of the house_of_peers closely followed by monsieur_albert who availed himself of the few minute required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar and to arrange the lappets of his coat this important task was just completed as they arrived at the countessâ box at the knock the door was immediately opened and the young man who was seated beside the countess in obedience to the italian custom instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers who in turn would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other visitors m_franz_de_quesnel presented monsieur_albert as one of the most distinguished young man of the day both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents nor did he say more than the truth for in paris and the circle in which the viscount moved he was looked upon and cited as a model of perfection
franz added that his companion deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in paris was most anxious to make up for it and had requested him m_franz_de_quesnel to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do so the countess in reply bowed gracefully to monsieur_albert and extended her hand with cordial kindness to m_franz_de_quesnel then inviting monsieur_albert to take the vacant seat beside her she recommended m_franz_de_quesnel to take the next best if he wished to view the ballet and pointed to the one behind her own chair monsieur_albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon paris and parisian matters speaking to the countess of the various person they both knew there m_franz_de_quesnel perceived how completely he was in his element and unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt took up albertâ glass and began in his turn to survey the audience sitting alone in the front of a box immediately opposite but situated on the third row was a woman of exquisite beauty dressed in a greek costume which evidently from the ease and grace with which she wore it was her national attire behind her but in deep shadow was the outline of a masculine figure but the features of this latter personage it was not possible to distinguish m_franz_de_quesnel could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and monsieur_albert to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair albanian opposite since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either sex all i can tell about her
replied the countess is that she has been at rome since the beginning of the season for i saw her where she now sits the very first night of the season and since then she has never missed a performance sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her and at others she is merely attended by a black servant â and what do you think of her personal appearance â_oh i consider her perfectly lovelyâ she is just my idea of what medora must have been m_franz_de_quesnel and the countess exchanged a smile and then the latter resumed her conversation with monsieur_albert while m_franz_de_quesnel returned to his previous survey of the house_of_peers and company the curtain rose on the ballet which was one of those excellent specimens of the italian school admirably arranged and put on the stage by henri who has established for himself a great reputation throughout italy for his taste and skill in the choreographic artâ one of those masterly productions of grace method and elegance in which the whole corps de ballet from the principal dancers to the humblest supernumerary are all engaged on the stage at the same time and a hundred and fifty person may be seen exhibiting the same attitude or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous movement that would lead you to suppose that but one mind one act of volition influenced the moving mass the ballet was called poliska
however much the ballet might have claimed his attention m_franz_de_quesnel was too deeply occupied with the beautiful greek to take any note of it while she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it her eager animated look contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of her companion who during the whole time the piece lasted never even moved not even when the furious crashing din produced by the trumpets cymbals and chinese bells sounded their loudest from the orchestra of this he took no heed but was as far as appearances might be trusted enjoying soft repose and bright celestial dreams the ballet at length came to a close and the curtain fell amid the loud unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience owing to the very judicious plan of dividing the two acts of the opera with a ballet the pauses between the performances are very short the singers in the opera having time to repose themselves and change their costume when necessary while the dancers are executing their pirouettes and exhibiting their graceful step the overture to the second act began and at the first sound of the leaderâ bow across his violin m_franz_de_quesnel observed the sleeper slowly arise and approach the greek girl who turned around to say a few word to him and then leaning forward again on the railing of her box she became as absorbed as before in what was going on the countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade that though m_franz_de_quesnel tried his utmost he could not distinguish a single feature
the curtain rose and the attention of m_franz_de_quesnel was attracted by the actors and his eye turned from the box containing the greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the stage most of my readers are aware that the second act of parisina opens with the celebrated and effective duet in which parisina while sleeping betrays to azzo the secret of her love for ugo the injured husband goes through all the emotions of jealousy until conviction seizes on his mind and then in a frenzy of rage and indignation he awakens his guilty wife to tell her that he knows her guilt and to threaten her with his vengeance this duet is one of the most beautiful expressive and terrible conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of donizetti m_franz_de_quesnel now listened to it for the third time yet its notes so tenderly expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent to their different griefs and passions thrilled through the soul of m_franz_de_quesnel with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it excited beyond his usual calm demeanor m_franz_de_quesnel rose with the audience and was about to join the loud enthusiastic applause that followed but suddenly his purpose was arrested his hand fell by his side and the half uttered bravosâ expired on his lip
the occupant of the box in which the greek girl sat appeared to share the universal admiration that prevailed for he left his seat to stand up in front so that his countenance being fully revealed m_franz_de_quesnel had no difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of count_of_monte_cristo and the very same person he had encountered the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum and whose voice and figure had seemed so familiar to him all doubt of his identity was now at an end his singular host evidently resided at rome the surprise and agitation occasioned by this full confirmation of franzâ former suspicion had no doubt imparted a corresponding expression to his features for the countess after gazing with a puzzled look at his face burst into a fit of laughter and begged to know what had happened countess returned m_franz_de_quesnel totally unheeding her raillery i asked you a short time since if you knew any particulars respecting the albanian lady opposite i must now beseech you to inform me who and what is her husband â nay answered the countess i know no more of him than yourself â perhaps you never before noticed him â what a questionâ so truly french do you not know that we italians have eye only for the man we love â true replied m_franz_de_quesnel all i can say is continued the countess taking up the lorgnette and directing it toward the box in question that the gentleman whose history i am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up he look more like a corpse permitted by some friendly grave digger to quit his tomb for a while and revisit this earth of ours than anything human
how ghastly pale he is â_oh he is always as colorless as you now see him said m_franz_de_quesnel then you know him almost screamed the countess â_oh pray do for heavenâ sake tell us all aboutâ is he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse or what â i fancy i have seen him before and i even think he recognizes me â and i can well understand said the countess shrugging up her beautiful shoulders as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget him the sensation experienced by m_franz_de_quesnel was evidently not peculiar to himself another and wholly uninterested person felt the same unaccountable awe and misgiving well inquired m_franz_de_quesnel after the countess had a second time directed her lorgnette at the box what do you think of our opposite neighbor 20147m why that he is no other than lord_ruthven himself in a living form this fresh allusion to byron5 drew a smile to franzâ countenance although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him i must positively find out who and what he is said m_franz_de_quesnel rising from his seat no no cried the countess you must not leave me i depend upon you to escort me home oh indeed i cannot permit you to go â is it possible whispered m_franz_de_quesnel that you entertain any fear â iâ ll tell you answered the countess byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires and even assured me that he had seen them the description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character of the man before us
oh he is the exact personification of what i have been led to expect the coal black hair large bright glittering eye in which a wild unearthly fire seems burning the same ghastly paleness then observe too that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex she is a foreignerâ a stranger nobody knows who she is or where she comes from no doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does and is like himself a dealer in magical arts i entreat of you not to go near himâ at least tonight and if tomorrow your curiosity still continues as great pursue your researches if you will but tonight you neither can nor shall for that purpose i mean to keep you all to myself m_franz_de_quesnel protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day for many reasons listen to me said the countess and do not be so very headstrong i am going home i have a party at my house_of_peers tonight and therefore cannot possibly remain till the end of the opera now i cannot for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it there was nothing else left for m_franz_de_quesnel to do but to take up his hat open the door of the box and offer the countess his arm it was quite evident by her manner that her uneasiness was not feigned and m_franz_de_quesnel himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dreadâ so much the stronger in him as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths
franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage upon arriving at her hotel m_franz_de_quesnel perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company on the contrary her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly to astonish the servant excuse my little subterfuge said the countess in reply to her companionâ half reproachful observation on the subject but that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable and i longed to be alone that i might compose my startled mind m_franz_de_quesnel essayed to smile nay said she do not smile it ill accords with the expression of your countenance and i am sure it does not spring from your heart however promise me one thing â what is it â promise me i say â i will do anything you desire except relinquish my determination of finding out who this man is i have more reasons than you can imagine for desiring to know who he is from whence he came and whither he is going â where he comes from i am ignorant but i can readily tell you where he is going to and that is down below without the least doubt â let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make said m_franz_de_quesnel well then you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel and make no attempt to follow this man tonight there are certain affinities between the person we quit and those we meet afterwards for heavenâ sake do not serve as a conductor between that man and me pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please but never bring him near me if you would not see me die of terror
and now good night go to your room and try to sleep away all recollections of this evening for my own part i am quite sure i shall not be able to close my eye so saying the countess quitted m_franz_de_quesnel leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense or whether her fears and agitations were genuine upon his return to the hotel m_franz_de_quesnel found monsieur_albert in his dressing gown and slippers listlessly extended on a sofa smoking a cigar my dear fellow cried he springing up is it really you why i did not expect to see you before tomorrow â my dear monsieur_albert replied m_franz_de_quesnel i am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning italian woman i should have thought the continual failures you have met with in all your own love affairs might have taught you better by this time â upon my soul these woman would puzzle the very devil to read them aright why hereâ they give you their handâ they press yours in returnâ they keep up a whispering conversationâ permit you to accompany them home why if a parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these marks of flattering attention her reputation would be gone forever â and the very reason why the woman of this fine country where sounds the si as dante writes put so little restraint on their word and actions is because they live so much in public and have really nothing to conceal besides you must have perceived that the countess was really alarmed â at what at the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting opposite to us in the same box with the lovely greek girl
now for my part i met them in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece and hang me if i can guess where you took your notions of the other world from i can assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced fine looking fellowâ admirably dressed indeed i feel quite sure from the cut of his clothes they are made by a first rate paris tailorâ probably blin or humann he was rather too pale certainly but then you know paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and distinguished breeding m_franz_de_quesnel smiled for he well remembered that monsieur_albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion well that tends to confirm my own idea said m_franz_de_quesnel that the countessâ suspicions were destitute alike of sense and reason did he speak in your hearing and did you catch any of his word â i did but they were uttered in the romaic dialect i knew that from the mixture of greek word i donâ know whether i ever told you that when i was at college i was ratherâ rather strong in greek â he spoke the romaic language did he â i think so â that settles it murmured m_franz_de_quesnel â tis he past all doubt â what do you say â nothing nothing but tell me what were you thinking about when i came in â_oh i was arranging a little surprise for you â indeed of what nature â why you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage â certainly and i also know that we have done all that human means afforded to endeavor to get one â now then in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my brain
franz looked at monsieur_albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his imagination i tell you what m_franz_de_quesnel cried monsieur_albert you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were pleased to bestow on me just now â and i promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your scheme turns out as ingenious as you assert â well then hearken to me â i listen â you agree do you not that obtaining a carriage is out of the question â i do â neither can we procure horse â true we have offered any sum but have failed â well now what do you say to a cart i dare say such a thing might be had â very possibly â and a pair of oxen â as easily found as the cart â then you see my good fellow with a cart and a couple of oxen our business can be managed the cart must be tastefully ornamented and if you and i dress ourselves as neapolitan reapers we may get up a striking tableau after the manner of that splendid picture by lã opold robert it would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us in the costume of a peasant from puzzoli or sorrento our group would then be quite complete more especially as the countess is quite beautiful enough to represent a madonna â well said m_franz_de_quesnel this time monsieur_albert i am bound to give you credit for having hit upon a most capital idea â and quite a national one too replied monsieur_albert with gratified pride a mere masque borrowed from our own festivities ha ha ye romans
you thought to make us unhappy strangers trot at the heels of your processions like so many lazzaroni because no carriage or horse are to be had in your beggarly city but you donâ know us when we canâ have one thing we invent another â and have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody â only to our host upon my return home i sent for him and i then explained to him what i wished to procure he assured me that nothing would be easier than to furnish all i desired one thing i was sorry for when i bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three day to do that so you see we must do without this little superfluity â and where is he now â who â our host â gone out in search of our equipage by tomorrow it might be too late â then he will be able to give us an answer tonight â_oh i expect him every minute at this instant the door opened and the head of signor_pastrini appeared permesso inquired he certainlyâ certainly cried m_franz_de_quesnel come in my host â now then asked monsieur_albert eagerly have you found the desired cart and oxen â better than that replied signor_pastrini with the air of a man perfectly well satisfied with himself take care my worthy host said monsieur_albert better is a sure enemy to well â let your excellencies only leave the matter to me returned signor_pastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded self confidence but what have you done asked m_franz_de_quesnel
â speak out thereâ a worthy fellow â your excellencies are aware responded the landlord swelling with importance that the count_of_monte_cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves â i should think we did know it exclaimed monsieur_albert since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small room like two poor students in the back streets of paris â when then the count_of_monte_cristo hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two place at his window in the palazzo rospoli the friend looked at each other with unutterable surprise but do you think asked monsieur_albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger â what sort of person is this count_of_monte_cristo asked m_franz_de_quesnel of his host a very great nobleman but whether maltese or sicilian i cannot exactly say but this i know that he is noble as a borghese and rich as a gold mine â_it seems to me said m_franz_de_quesnel speaking in an undertone to monsieur_albert that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way he would have writtenâ orâ â at this instant someone knocked at the door come in said m_franz_de_quesnel a servant wearing a livery of considerable style and richness appeared at the threshold and placing two cards in the landlordâ hand who forthwith presented them to the two young man he said please to deliver these from the count_of_monte_cristo to vicomte monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf and m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay
the count_of_monte_cristo continued the servant begs these gentlemenâ permission to wait upon them as their neighbor and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will please to receive him â faith m_franz_de_quesnel whispered monsieur_albert there is not much to find fault with here â tell the count replied m_franz_de_quesnel that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on him the servant bowed and retired that is what i call an elegant mode of attack said monsieur_albert you were quite correct in what you said signor_pastrini the count_of_monte_cristo is unquestionably a man of first rate breeding and knowledge of the world â then you accept his offer said the host of course we do replied monsieur_albert still i must own i am sorry to be obliged to give up the cart and the group of reapersâ it would have produced such an effect and were it not for the window at the palazzo rospoli by way of recompense for the loss of our beautiful scheme i donâ know but what i should have held on by my original plan what say you m_franz_de_quesnel â_oh i agree with you the window in the palazzo rospoli alone decided me
the truth was that the mention of two place in the palazzo rospoli had recalled to m_franz_de_quesnel the conversation he had overheard the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum between the mysterious unknown and the transteverin in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal and if this muffled up individual proved as m_franz_de_quesnel felt sure he would the same as the person he had just seen in the teatro argentina then he should be able to establish his identity and also to prosecute his researches respecting him with perfect facility and freedom m_franz_de_quesnel passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had already had with his mysterious tormentor and in waking speculations as to what the morrow would produce the next day must clear up every doubt and unless his near neighbor and would be friend the count_of_monte_cristo possessed the ring of gyges and by its power was able to render himself invisible it was very certain he could not escape this time eight oâ clock found m_franz_de_quesnel up and dressed while monsieur_albert who had not the same motives for early rising was still soundly asleep the first act of m_franz_de_quesnel was to summon his landlord who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness
â pray signor_pastrini asked m_franz_de_quesnel is not some execution appointed to take place today â_yes your excellency but if your reason for inquiry is that you may procure a window to view it from you are much too late â_oh no answered m_franz_de_quesnel i had no such intention and even if i had felt a wish to witness the spectacle i might have done so from monte pincio could i not â ah exclaimed mine host i did not think it likely your excellency would have chosen to mingle with such a rabble as are always collected on that hill which indeed they consider as exclusively belonging to themselves â very possibly i may not go answered m_franz_de_quesnel but in case i feel disposed give me some particulars of todayâ executions â what particulars would your excellency like to hear â why the number of person condemned to suffer their name and description of the death they are to die â that happens just lucky your excellency only a few minute ago they brought me the tavolettas â what are they â sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening before an execution on which is pasted up a paper containing the name of the condemned person their crimes and mode of punishment the reason for so publicly announcing all this is that all good and faithful catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits and above all beseech of heaven to grant them a sincere repentance â and these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful are they asked m_franz_de_quesnel somewhat incredulously â_oh dear no your excellency
i have not time for anybodyâ affairs but my own and those of my honorable guests but i make an agreement with the man who pastes up the paper and he brings them to me as he would the playbills that in case any person staying at my hotel should like to witness an execution he may obtain every requisite information concerning the time and place etc â upon my word that is a most delicate attention on your part signor_pastrini cried m_franz_de_quesnel why your excellency returned the landlord chuckling and rubbing his hand with infinite complacency i think i may take upon myself to say i neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor hotel â i see that plainly enough my most excellent host and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever i go meanwhile oblige me by a sight of one of these tavolettas â nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellencyâ wish said the landlord opening the door of the chamber i have caused one to be placed on the landing close by your apartment
then taking the tablet from the wall he handed it to m_franz_de_quesnel who read as follows â the public is informed that on wednesday february 23rd being the first day of the carnival executions will take place in the piazza del popolo by order of the tribunal of the rota of two person named m_andrea_cavalcanti rondolo and peppino otherwise called rocca priori the former found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest named don cã_sar_borgia torlini canon of the church of st john lateran and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit luigi_vampa and his band the first named malefactor will be mazzolato the second culprit decapitato â the prayers of all good christians are entreated for these unfortunate man that it may please god to awaken them to a sense of their guilt and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their crimes â this was precisely what m_franz_de_quesnel had heard the evening before in the ruins of the colosseum no part of the programme differed the name of the condemned person their crimes and mode of punishment all agreed with his previous information in all probability therefore the transteverin was no other than the bandit luigi_vampa himself and the man shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as sinbad the sailor but who no doubt was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition in rome as he had already done at porto vecchio and tunis time was getting on however and m_franz_de_quesnel deemed it advisable to awaken monsieur_albert but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber his friend entered the room in perfect costume for the day
the anticipated delights of the carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual hour now my excellent signor_pastrini said m_franz_de_quesnel addressing his landlord since we are both ready do you think we may proceed at once to visit the count_of_monte_cristo â most assuredly replied he the count_of_monte_cristo is always an early riser and i can answer for his having been up these two hour â then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our respects to him directly 20155m â_oh i am quite sure i will take all the blame on myself if you find i have led you into an error â well then if it be so are you ready monsieur_albert â perfectly â let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy â_yes let us do so the landlord preceded the friend across the landing which was all that separated them from the apartments of the count rang at the bell and upon the door being opened by a servant said i signori francesi the domestic bowed respectfully and invited them to enter they passed through two room furnished in a luxurious manner they had not expected to see under the roof of signor_pastrini and were shown into an elegantly fitted up drawing room the richest turkey carpets covered the floor and the softest and most inviting couches easy chairs and sofas offered their high piled and yielding cushions to such as desired repose or refreshment splendid paintings by the first masters were ranged against the wall intermingled with magnificent trophies of war while heavy curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before the different door of the room if your excellencies will please to be seated said the man
i will let the count know that you are here and with these word he disappeared behind one of the tapestried portiã res as the door opened the sound of a guzla reached the ears of the young man but was almost immediately lost for the rapid closing of the door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to enter m_franz_de_quesnel and monsieur_albert looked inquiringly at each other then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment everything seemed more magnificent at a second view than it had done at their first rapid survey well said m_franz_de_quesnel to his friend what think you of all this â why upon my soul my dear fellow it strikes me that our elegant and attentive neighbor must either be some successful stock jobber who has speculated in the fall of the spanish funds or some prince travelling incog â hush hush replied m_franz_de_quesnel we shall ascertain who and what he isâ he comes as m_franz_de_quesnel spoke he heard the sound of a door turning on its hinges and almost immediately afterwards the tapestry was drawn aside and the owner of all these riches stood before the two young man monsieur_albert instantly rose to meet him but m_franz_de_quesnel remained in a manner spellbound on his chair for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the colosseum and the occupant of the box at the teatro argentina but also his extraordinary host of count_of_monte_cristo 20157 chapter 35
la mazzolata gentlemen said the count_of_monte_cristo as he entered i pray you excuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated but i feared to disturb you by presenting myself earlier at your apartments besides you sent me word that you would come to me and i have held myself at your disposal â m_franz_de_quesnel and i have to thank you a thousand time count returned monsieur_albert you extricated us from a great dilemma and we were on the point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly invitation reached us â indeed returned the count motioning the two young man to sit down â_it was the fault of that blockhead signor_pastrini that i did not sooner assist you in your distress he did not mention a syllable of your embarrassment to me when he knows that alone and isolated as i am i seek every opportunity of making the acquaintance of my neighbors as soon as i learned i could in any way assist you i most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my services the two young man bowed m_franz_de_quesnel had as yet found nothing to say he had come to no determination and as nothing in the countâ manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past or wait until he had more proof besides although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the colosseum he resolved therefore to let thing take their course without making any direct overture to the count
moreover he had this advantage he was master of the countâ secret while the count had no hold on m_franz_de_quesnel who had nothing to conceal however he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his doubts count said he you have offered us place in your carriage and at your window in the rospoli palace can you tell us where we can obtain a sight of the piazza del popolo â ah said the count negligently looking attentively at viscount_albert_de_morcerf is there not something like an execution upon the piazza del popolo â_yes returned m_franz_de_quesnel finding that the count was coming to the point he wished stay i think i told my steward yesterday to attend to this perhaps i can render you this slight service also he extended his hand and rang the bell thrice did you ever occupy yourself said he to m_franz_de_quesnel with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servant i have when i ring once it is for my valet twice for my majordomo thrice for my steward thus i do not waste a minute or a word here he is a man of about forty five or fifty entered exactly resembling the smuggler who had introduced m_franz_de_quesnel into the cavern but he did not appear to recognize him it was evident he had his order monsieur_albert monsieur_bertuccio said the count you have procured me window looking on the piazza del popolo as i ordered you yesterday â_yes excellency returned the steward but it was very late â did i not tell you i wished for one replied the count frowning and
your excellency has one which was let to prince lobanieff but i was obliged to pay a hundredâ â that will doâ that will do monsieur_albert monsieur_bertuccio spare these gentlemen all such domestic arrangements you have the window that is sufficient give order to the coachman and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to it the steward bowed and was about to quit the room ah continued the count be good enough to ask signor_pastrini if he has received the tavoletta and if he can send us an account of the execution â there is no need to do that said m_franz_de_quesnel taking out his tablets for i saw the account and copied it down â very well you can retire monsieur_bertuccio i need you no longer let us know when breakfast is ready these gentlemen added he turning to the two friend will i trust do me the honor to breakfast with me â but my dear count said monsieur_albert we shall abuse your kindness â not at all on the contrary you will give me great pleasure you will one or other of you perhaps both return it to me at paris monsieur_bertuccio lay covers for three he then took franzâ tablets out of his hand â we announce he read in the same tone with which he would have read a newspaper that today the 23rd of february will be executed m_andrea_cavalcanti rondolo guilty of murder on the person of the respected and venerated don cã_sar_borgia torlini canon of the church of st john lateran and peppino called rocca priori convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit luigi_vampa and the man of his band â hum the first will be mazzolato the second decapitato
yes continued the count â_it was at first arranged in this way but i think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the ceremony â really said m_franz_de_quesnel â_yes i passed the evening at the cardinal rospigliosiâ and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two man â for m_andrea_cavalcanti rondolo asked m_franz_de_quesnel no replied the count carelessly for the other he glanced at the tablets as if to recall the name for peppino called rocca priori you are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined but the mazzolata still remains which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time and even the second while the other as you must know is very simple the mandaã a never fails never trembles never strikes thirty time ineffectually like the soldier who beheaded the count of chalais and to whose tender mercy richelieu had doubtless recommended the sufferer ah added the count in a contemptuous tone do not tell me of european punishments they are in the infancy or rather the old age of cruelty â really count replied m_franz_de_quesnel one would think that you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the world â there are at least few that i have not seen said the count coldly and you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles â my first sentiment was horror the second indifference the third curiosity â curiosityâ that is a terrible word â why so in life our greatest preoccupation is death is it not then curious to study the different way by which the soul and body can part and how according to their different characters temperaments and even the different customs of their countries different person bear the transition from life to death from existence to annihilation
as for myself i can assure you of one thing the more man you see die the easier it becomes to die yourself and in my opinion death may be a torture but it is not an expiation â i do not quite understand you replied m_franz_de_quesnel pray explain your meaning for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch â listen said the count and deep hatred mounted to his face as the blood would to the face of any other if a man had by unheard of and excruciating tortures destroyed your father your mother your betrothed a being who when torn from you left a desolation a wound that never closes in your breast do you think the reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of the murderer and allows him who has caused us year of moral sufferings to escape with a few moment of physical pain â_yes i know said m_franz_de_quesnel that human justice is insufficient to console us she can give blood in return for blood that is all but you must demand from her only what it is in her power to grant â i will put another case to you continued the count that where society attacked by the death of a person avenges death by death but are there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer without society taking the least cognizance of them or offering him even the insufficient means of vengeance of which we have just spoken are there not crimes for which the impalement of the turks the augers of the persians the stake and the brand of the iroquois indians are inadequate tortures and which are unpunished by society
answer me do not these crimes exist â_yes answered m_franz_de_quesnel and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated â ah duelling cried the count a pleasant manner upon my soul of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance a man has carried off your mistress a man has seduced your wife a man has dishonored your daughter he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to expect from heaven that portion of happiness god has promised to everyone of his creatures an existence of misery and infamy and you think you are avenged because you send a ball through the head or pass a sword through the breast of that man who has planted madness in your brain and despair in your heart and remember moreover that it is often he who comes off victorious from the strife absolved of all crime in the eye of the world no no continued the count had i to avenge myself it is not thus i would take revenge â then you disapprove of duelling you would not fight a duel asked monsieur_albert in his turn astonished at this strange theory â_oh yes replied the count understand me i would fight a duel for a trifle for an insult for a blow and the more so that thanks to my skill in all bodily exercises and the indifference to danger i have gradually acquired i should be almost certain to kill my man
oh i would fight for such a cause but in return for a slow profound eternal torture i would give back the same were it possible an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth as the orientalists say our masters in everything those favored creatures who have formed for themselves a life of dreams and a paradise of realities â but said m_franz_de_quesnel to the count with this theory which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause it would be difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power of the law hatred is blind rage carries you away and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught â_yes if he be poor and inexperienced not if he be rich and skilful besides the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of which we have already spoken and which the philanthropic french revolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horse or broken on the wheel what matters this punishment as long as he is avenged on my word i almost regret that in all probability this miserable peppino will not be beheaded as you might have had an opportunity then of seeing how short a time the punishment lasts and whether it is worth even mentioning but really this is a most singular conversation for the carnival gentlemen how did it arise ah i recollect you asked for a place at my window you shall have it but let us first sit down to table for here comes the servant to inform us that breakfast is ready as he spoke a servant opened one of the four door of the apartment saying al suo commodo
the two young man arose and entered the breakfast room during the meal which was excellent and admirably served m_franz_de_quesnel looked repeatedly at monsieur_albert in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the word of their entertainer but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him whether the explanation of the count_of_monte_cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him or whether the events which m_franz_de_quesnel knew of had had their effect on him alone he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five month had been condemned to partake of italian cookeryâ that is the worst in the world as for the count he just touched the dishes he seemed to fulfil the duties of a host by sitting down with his guests and awaited their departure to be served with some strange or more delicate food this brought back to m_franz_de_quesnel in spite of himself the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the countess gâ and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was a vampire at the end of the breakfast m_franz_de_quesnel took out his watch well said the count what are you doing â you must excuse us count returned m_franz_de_quesnel but we have still much to do â what may that be â we have no masks and it is absolutely necessary to procure them â do not concern yourself about that
we have i think a private room in the piazza del popolo i will have whatever costumes you choose brought to us and you can dress there â after the execution cried m_franz_de_quesnel before or after whichever you please â opposite the scaffold â the scaffold forms part of the fãªte â count i have reflected on the matter said m_franz_de_quesnel i thank you for your courtesy but i shall content myself with accepting a place in your carriage and at your window at the rospoli palace and i leave you at liberty to dispose of my place at the piazza del popolo â but i warn you you will lose a very curious sight returned the count you will describe it to me replied m_franz_de_quesnel and the recital from your lip will make as great an impression on me as if i had witnessed it i have more than once intended witnessing an execution but i have never been able to make up my mind and you monsieur_albert â i replied the viscount â i saw castaing executed but i think i was rather intoxicated that day for i had quitted college the same morning and we had passed the previous night at a tavern â besides it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at paris that you should not see one anywhere else when you travel it is to see everything think what a figure you will make when you are asked how do they execute at rome and you reply i do not know and besides they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own son
diable when a churchman is killed it should be with a different weapon than a log especially when he has behaved like a father if you went to spain would you not see the bull fights well suppose it is a bull fight you are going to see recollect the ancient romans of the circus and the sports where they killed three hundred lions and a hundred man think of the eighty thousand applauding spectators the sage matrons who took their daughter and the charming vestals who made with the thumb of their white hand the fatal sign that said come despatch the dying â shall you go then monsieur_albert asked m_franz_de_quesnel ma foi yes like you i hesitated but the countâ eloquence decides me â let us go then said m_franz_de_quesnel since you wish it but on our way to the piazza del popolo i wish to pass through the corso is this possible count â on foot yes in a carriage no â i will go on foot then â is it important that you should go that way â_yes there is something i wish to see â well we will go by the corso we will send the carriage to wait for us on the piazza del popolo by the via del babuino for i shall be glad to pass myself through the corso to see if some order i have given have been executed â excellency said a servant opening the door a man in the dress of a penitent wishes to speak to you â ah yes returned the count i know who he is gentlemen will you return to the salon you will find good cigars on the centre table i will be with you directly
the young man rose and returned into the salon while the count again apologizing left by another door monsieur_albert who was a great smoker and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the cafã de paris approached the table and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable puros well asked m_franz_de_quesnel what think you of the count_of_monte_cristo â what do i think said monsieur_albert evidently surprised at such a question from his companion i think he is a delightful fellow who does the honor of his table admirably who has travelled much read much is like brutus of the stoic school and moreover added he sending a volume of smoke up towards the ceiling that he has excellent cigars such was albertâ opinion of the count and as m_franz_de_quesnel well knew that monsieur_albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection he made no attempt to change it but said he did you observe one very singular thing â what â how attentively he looked at you â at me â_yes monsieur_albert reflected ah replied he sighing that is not very surprising i have been more than a year absent from paris and my clothes are of a most antiquated cut the count takes me for a provincial the first opportunity you have undeceive him i beg and tell him i am nothing of the kind m_franz_de_quesnel smiled an instant after the count entered i am now quite at your service gentlemen said he the carriage is going one way to the piazza del popolo and we will go another and if you please by the corso take some more of these cigars de viscount_albert_de_morcerf â with all my heart returned monsieur_albert italian cigars are horrible
when you come to paris i will return all this â i will not refuse i intend going there soon and since you allow me i will pay you a visit come we have not any time to lose it is half past twelveâ let us set off all three descended the coachman received his masterâ order and drove down the via del babuino while the three gentlemen walked along the piazza di spagna and the via frattina which led directly between the fiano and rospoli palaces franzâ attention was directed towards the window of that last palace for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the man in the mantle and the transtevere peasant which are your window asked he of the count with as much indifference as he could assume the three last returned he with a negligence evidently unaffected for he could not imagine with what intention the question was put m_franz_de_quesnel glanced rapidly towards the three window the side window were hung with yellow damask and the centre one with white damask and a red cross the man in the mantle had kept his promise to the transteverin and there could now be no doubt that he was the count the three window were still untenanted preparations were making on every side chairs were placed scaffolds were raised and window were hung with flags the masks could not appear the carriage could not move about but the masks were visible behind the window the carriage and the door m_franz_de_quesnel monsieur_albert and the count continued to descend the corso
as they approached the piazza del popolo the crowd became more dense and above the head of the multitude two objects were visible the obelisk surmounted by a cross which marks the centre of the square and in front of the obelisk at the point where the three streets del babuino del corso and di ripetta meet the two uprights of the scaffold between which glittered the curved knife of the mandaã a at the corner of the street they met the countâ steward who was awaiting his master the window let at an exorbitant price which the count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests was on the second floor of the great palace situated between the via del babuino and the monte pincio it consisted as we have said of a small dressing room opening into a bedroom and when the door of communication was shut the inmates were quite alone on chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white satin 20167m as you left the choice of your costumes to me said the count to the two friend i have had these brought as they will be the most worn this year and they are most suitable on account of the confetti sweetmeats as they do not show the flour m_franz_de_quesnel heard the word of the count but imperfectly and he perhaps did not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the piazza del popolo presented and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre it was the first time m_franz_de_quesnel had ever seen a guillotine we say guillotine because the roman mandaã a is formed on almost the same model as the french instrument 7
the knife which is shaped like a crescent that cuts with the convex side falls from a less height and that is all the difference two man seated on the movable plank on which the victim is laid were eating their breakfasts while waiting for the criminal their repast consisted apparently of bread and sausages one of them lifted the plank took out a flask of wine drank some and then passed it to his companion these two man were the executionerâ assistants at this sight m_franz_de_quesnel felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow the prisoners transported the previous evening from the carceri nuove to the little church of santa maria del popolo had passed the night each accompanied by two priests in a chapel closed by a grating before which were two sentinels who were relieved at intervals a double line of carbineers placed on each side of the door of the church reached to the scaffold and formed a circle around it leaving a path about ten foot wide and around the guillotine a space of nearly a hundred foot all the rest of the square was paved with head many woman held their infants on their shoulders and thus the child had the best view the monte pincio seemed a vast amphitheatre filled with spectators the balconies of the two churches at the corner of the via del babuino and the via di ripetta were crammed the step even seemed a parti colored sea that was impelled towards the portico every niche in the wall held its living statue what the count said was trueâ the most curious spectacle in life is that of death and yet instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion laughter and jests arose from the crowd
it was evident that the execution was in the eye of the people only the commencement of the carnival suddenly the tumult ceased as if by magic and the door of the church opened a brotherhood of penitents clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth with holes for the eye and holding in their hand lighted tapers appeared first the chief marched at the head 20169 behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions he was naked with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledge hammer this man was the executioner he had moreover sandals bound on his foot by cords behind the executioner came in the order in which they were to die first peppino and then m_andrea_cavalcanti each was accompanied by two priests neither had his eye bandaged peppino walked with a firm step doubtless aware of what awaited him m_andrea_cavalcanti was supported by two priests each of them from time to time kissed the crucifix a confessor held out to them at this sight alone m_franz_de_quesnel felt his legs tremble under him he looked at albertâ he was as white as his shirt and mechanically cast away his cigar although he had not half smoked it the count alone seemed unmovedâ nay more a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks his nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey and his lip half opened disclosed his white teeth small and sharp like those of a jackal
and yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness such as m_franz_de_quesnel had never before witnessed in them his black eye especially were full of kindness and pity however the two culprits advanced and as they approached their face became visible peppino was a handsome young man of four or five and twenty bronzed by the sun he carried his head erect and seemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator would appear m_andrea_cavalcanti was short and fat his visage marked with brutal cruelty did not indicate age he might be thirty in prison he had suffered his beard to grow his head fell on his shoulder his legs bent beneath him and his movements were apparently automatic and unconscious i thought said m_franz_de_quesnel to the count that you told me there would be but one execution â i told you true replied he coldly and yet here are two culprits â_yes but only one of these two is about to die the other has many year to live â if the pardon is to come there is no time to lose â and see here it is said the count at the moment when peppino reached the foot of the mandaã a a priest arrived in some haste forced his way through the soldiers and advancing to the chief of the brotherhood gave him a folded paper the piercing eye of peppino had noticed all the chief took the paper unfolded it and raising his hand heaven be praised and his holiness also said he in a loud voice here is a pardon for one of the prisoners â a pardon cried the people with one voice a pardon at this cry m_andrea_cavalcanti raised his head pardon for whom cried he peppino remained breathless
â a pardon for peppino called rocca priori said the principal friar and he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers who read and returned it to him for peppino cried m_andrea_cavalcanti who seemed roused from the torpor in which he had been plunged why for him and not for me we ought to die together i was promised he should die with me you have no right to put me to death alone i will not die aloneâ i will not and he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hand the executioner made a sign and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold and seized him what is going on asked m_franz_de_quesnel of the count for as all the talk was in the roman dialect he had not perfectly understood it do you not see returned the count that this human creature who is about to die is furious that his fellow sufferer does not perish with him and were he able he would rather tear him to pieces with his teeth and nails than let him enjoy the life he himself is about to be deprived of oh man manâ race of crocodiles cried the count extending his clenched hand towards the crowd how well do i recognize you there and that at all time you are worthy of yourselves meanwhile m_andrea_cavalcanti and the two executioners were struggling on the ground and he kept exclaiming he ought to die he shall die i will not die alone â look look cried the count seizing the young menâ hand look for on my soul it is curious
here is a man who had resigned himself to his fate who was going to the scaffold to dieâ like a coward it is true but he was about to die without resistance do you know what gave him strength do you know what consoled him it was that another partook of his punishmentâ that another partook of his anguishâ that another was to die before him lead two sheep to the butcherâ two oxen to the slaughterhouse and make one of them understand that his companion will not die the sheep will bleat for pleasure the ox will bellow with joy but manâ man whom god created in his own imageâ man upon whom god has laid his first his sole commandment to love his neighborâ man to whom god has given a voice to express his thoughtsâ what is his first cry when he hears his fellow man is saved a blasphemy honor to man this masterpiece of nature this king of the creation and the count burst into a laugh a terrible laugh that showed he must have suffered horribly to be able thus to laugh however the struggle still continued and it was dreadful to witness the two assistants carried m_andrea_cavalcanti up to the scaffold the people all took part against m_andrea_cavalcanti and twenty thousand voice cried put him to death put him to death m_franz_de_quesnel sprang back but the count seized his arm and held him before the window what are you doing said he do you pity him if you heard the cry of mad dog you would take your gunâ you would unhesitatingly shoot the poor beast who after all was only guilty of having been bitten by another dog
and yet you pity a man who without being bitten by one of his race has yet murdered his benefactor and who now unable to kill anyone because his hand are bound wishes to see his companion in captivity perish no noâ look look 20172m the recommendation was needless m_franz_de_quesnel was fascinated by the horrible spectacle the two assistants had borne m_andrea_cavalcanti to the scaffold and there in spite of his struggles his bites and his cries had forced him to his knees during this time the executioner had raised his mace and signed to them to get out of the way the criminal strove to rise but ere he had time the mace fell on his left temple a dull and heavy sound was heard and the man dropped like an ox on his face and then turned over on his back the executioner let fall his mace drew his knife and with one stroke opened his throat and mounting on his stomach stamped violently on it with his foot at every stroke a jet of blood sprang from the wound this time m_franz_de_quesnel could contain himself no longer but sank half fainting into a seat monsieur_albert with his eye closed was standing grasping the window curtains the count was erect and triumphant like the avenging angel chapter 36 the carnival at rome when m_franz_de_quesnel recovered his senses he saw monsieur_albert drinking a glass of water of which to judge from his pallor he stood in great need and the count who was assuming his masquerade costume he glanced mechanically towards the piazzaâ the scene was wholly changed scaffold executioners victims all had disappeared only the people remained full of noise and excitement
the bell of monte citorio which only sounds on the popeâ decease and the opening of the carnival was ringing a joyous peal well asked he of the count what has then happened â nothing replied the count only as you see the carnival has commenced make haste and dress yourself â in fact said m_franz_de_quesnel this horrible scene has passed away like a dream â_it is but a dream a nightmare that has disturbed you â_yes that i have suffered but the culprit â that is a dream also only he has remained asleep while you have awakened and who knows which of you is the most fortunate â but peppinoâ what has become of him â peppino is a lad of sense who unlike most man who are happy in proportion as they are noticed was delighted to see that the general attention was directed towards his companion he profited by this distraction to slip away among the crowd without even thanking the worthy priests who accompanied him decidedly man is an ungrateful and egotistical animal but dress yourself see de viscount_albert_de_morcerf sets you the example monsieur_albert was drawing on the satin pantaloon over his black trousers and varnished boots well monsieur_albert said m_franz_de_quesnel do you feel much inclined to join the revels come answer frankly â ma foi no returned monsieur_albert but i am really glad to have seen such a sight and i understand what the count saidâ that when you have once habituated yourself to a similar spectacle it is the only one that causes you any emotion 20175m without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study character said the count on the step of the scaffold death tears off the mask that has been worn through life and the real visage is disclosed
it must be allowed that m_andrea_cavalcanti was not very handsome the hideous scoundrel come dress yourselves gentlemen dress yourselves m_franz_de_quesnel felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companionsâ example he assumed his costume and fastened on the mask that scarcely equalled the pallor of his own face their toilet finished they descended the carriage awaited them at the door filled with sweetmeats and bouquets they fell into the line of carriage it is difficult to form an idea of the perfect change that had taken place instead of the spectacle of gloomy and silent death the piazza del popolo presented a spectacle of gay and noisy mirth and revelry a crowd of masks flowed in from all side emerging from the door descending from the window from every street and every corner drove carriage filled with clowns harlequins dominoes mummers pantomimists transteverins knights and peasants screaming fighting gesticulating throwing eggs filled with flour confetti nosegays attacking with their sarcasms and their missiles friend and foes companions and strangers indiscriminately and no one took offence or did anything but laugh m_franz_de_quesnel and monsieur_albert were like man who to drive away a violent sorrow have recourse to wine and who as they drink and become intoxicated feel a thick veil drawn between the past and the present they saw or rather continued to see the image of what they had witnessed but little by little the general vertigo seized them and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion
a handful of confetti that came from a neighboring carriage and which while it covered viscount_albert_de_morcerf and his two companions with dust pricked his neck and that portion of his face uncovered by his mask like a hundred pins incited him to join in the general combat in which all the masks around him were engaged he rose in his turn and seizing handfuls of confetti and sweetmeats with which the carriage was filled cast them with all the force and skill he was master of 20177 the strife had fairly begun and the recollection of what they had seen half an hour before was gradually effaced from the young menâ mind so much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they now beheld as for the count_of_monte_cristo he had never for an instant shown any appearance of having been moved imagine the large and splendid corso bordered from one end to the other with lofty palaces with their balconies hung with carpets and their window with flags at these balconies are three hundred thousand spectatorsâ romans italians strangers from all part of the world the united aristocracy of birth wealth and genius lovely woman yielding to the influence of the scene bend over their balconies or lean from their window and shower down confetti which are returned by bouquets the air seems darkened with the falling confetti and flying flowers
in the streets the lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumesâ gigantic cabbages walk gravely about buffaloesâ head bellow from menâ shoulders dogs walk on their hind legs in the midst of all this a mask is lifted and as in callotâ temptation of st anthony a lovely face is exhibited which we would fain follow but from which we are separated by troops of fiends this will give a faint idea of the carnival at rome at the second turn the count stopped the carriage and requested permission to withdraw leaving the vehicle at their disposal m_franz_de_quesnel looked upâ they were opposite the rospoli palace at the centre window the one hung with white damask with a red cross was a blue domino beneath which franzâ imagination easily pictured the beautiful greek of the argentina gentlemen said the count springing out when you are tired of being actors and wish to become spectators of this scene you know you have place at my window in the meantime dispose of my coachman my carriage and my servant we have forgotten to mention that the countâ coachman was attired in a bear skin exactly resembling odryâ in the bear and the pasha and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys with spring masks with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed m_franz_de_quesnel thanked the count for his attention as for monsieur_albert he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of roman peasants that was passing near him unfortunately for him the line of carriage moved on again and while he descended the piazza del popolo the other ascended towards the palazzo di venezia ah my dear fellow said he to m_franz_de_quesnel you did not see â what â there that calash filled with roman peasants â no â well
i am convinced they are all charming woman â how unfortunate that you were masked monsieur_albert said m_franz_de_quesnel here was an opportunity of making up for past disappointments â_oh replied he half laughing half serious i hope the carnival will not pass without some amends in one shape or the other but in spite of albertâ hope the day passed unmarked by any incident excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of roman peasants at one of these encounters accidentally or purposely albertâ mask fell off he instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the carriage doubtless one of the charming females monsieur_albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry for as the carriage of the two friend passed her she threw a bunch of violets monsieur_albert seized it and as m_franz_de_quesnel had no reason to suppose it was meant for him he suffered monsieur_albert to retain it monsieur_albert placed it in his button hole and the carriage went triumphantly on well said m_franz_de_quesnel to him there is the beginning of an adventure â laugh if you pleaseâ i really think so so i will not abandon this bouquet â pardieu returned m_franz_de_quesnel laughing in token of your ingratitude the jest however soon appeared to become earnest for when monsieur_albert and m_franz_de_quesnel again encountered the carriage with the contadini the one who had thrown the violets to monsieur_albert clapped her hand when she beheld them in his button hole bravo bravo said m_franz_de_quesnel thing go wonderfully shall i leave you perhaps you would prefer being alone â no replied he i will not be caught like a fool at a first disclosure by a rendezvous under the clock as they say at the opera balls
if the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further we shall find her or rather she will find us tomorrow then she will give me some sign or other and i shall know what i have to do â on my word said m_franz_de_quesnel you are as wise as nestor and prudent as ulysses and your fair circe must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind monsieur_albert was right the fair unknown had resolved doubtless to carry the intrigue no farther for although the young man made several more turns they did not again see the calash which had turned up one of the neighboring streets then they returned to the rospoli palace but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared the two window hung with yellow damask were still occupied by the person whom the count had invited at this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the mascherata sounded the retreat the file on the corso broke the line and in a second all the carriage had disappeared m_franz_de_quesnel and monsieur_albert were opposite the via delle muratte the coachman without saying a word drove up it passed along the piazza di spagna and the rospoli palace and stopped at the door of the hotel signor_pastrini came to the door to receive his guests m_franz_de_quesnel hastened to inquire after the count and to express regret that he had not returned in sufficient time but signor_pastrini reassured him by saying that the count_of_monte_cristo had ordered a second carriage for himself and that it had gone at four oâ clock to fetch him from the rospoli palace
the count had moreover charged him to offer the two friend the key of his box at the argentina m_franz_de_quesnel questioned monsieur_albert as to his intentions but monsieur_albert had great projects to put into execution before going to the theatre and instead of making any answer he inquired if signor_pastrini could procure him a tailor a tailor said the host and for what â to make us between now and tomorrow two roman peasant costumes returned monsieur_albert the host shook his head to make you two costumes between now and tomorrow i ask your excellenciesâ pardon but this is quite a french demand for the next week you will not find a single tailor who would consent to sew six buttons on a waistcoat if you paid him a crown a piece for each button â then i must give up the idea â no we have them ready made leave all to me and tomorrow when you awake you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be satisfied â my dear monsieur_albert said m_franz_de_quesnel leave all to our host he has already proved himself full of resources let us dine quietly and afterwards go and see lâ italienne alger agreed returned monsieur_albert but remember signor_pastrini that both my friend and myself attach the greatest importance to having tomorrow the costumes we have asked for the host again assured them they might rely on him and that their wishes should be attended to upon which m_franz_de_quesnel and monsieur_albert mounted to their apartments and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their costumes monsieur_albert as he took off his dress carefully preserved the bunch of violets it was his token reserved for the morrow
the two friend sat down to table but they could not refrain from remarking the difference between the count of monte cristoâ table and that of signor_pastrini truth compelled m_franz_de_quesnel in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count to confess that the advantage was not on pastriniâ side during dessert the servant inquired at what time they wished for the carriage monsieur_albert and m_franz_de_quesnel looked at each other fearing really to abuse the countâ kindness the servant understood them his excellency the count_of_monte_cristo had he said given positive order that the carriage was to remain at their lordshipsâ order all day and they could therefore dispose of it without fear of indiscretion they resolved to profit by the countâ courtesy and ordered the horse to be harnessed while they substituted evening dress for that which they had on and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats they had sustained 20181m this precaution taken they went to the theatre and installed themselves in the countâ box during the first act the countess gâ entered her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the previous evening so that she perceived m_franz_de_quesnel and monsieur_albert in the place of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion to m_franz_de_quesnel her opera glass was so fixedly directed towards them that m_franz_de_quesnel saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity and availing himself of one of the privileges of the spectators of the italian theatres who use their boxes to hold receptions the two friend went to pay their respects to the countess scarcely had they entered when she motioned to m_franz_de_quesnel to assume the seat of honor monsieur_albert in his turn sat behind
â well said she hardly giving m_franz_de_quesnel time to sit down â_it seems you have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new lord_ruthven and you are already the best friend in the world â without being so far advanced as that my dear countess returned m_franz_de_quesnel i cannot deny that we have abused his good nature all day â all day â_yes this morning we breakfasted with him we rode in his carriage all day and now we have taken possession of his box â you know him then â_yes and no â how so â_it is a long story â tell it to me â_it would frighten you too much â so much the more reason â at least wait until the story has a conclusion â very well i prefer complete histories but tell me how you made his acquaintance did anyone introduce you to him â no it was he who introduced himself to us â when â last night after we left you â through what medium â the very prosaic one of our landlord â he is staying then at the hã tel de londres with you â not only in the same hotel but on the same floor â what is his name for of course you know â the count_of_monte_cristo â that is not a family name â no it is the name of the island he has purchased â and he is a count â a tuscan count â well we must put up with that said the countess who was herself from one of the oldest venetian families what sort of a man is he â ask the vicomte de viscount_albert_de_morcerf â you hear de viscount_albert_de_morcerf i am referred to you said the countess we should be very hard to please madam returned monsieur_albert did we not think him delightful
a friend of ten yearsâ standing could not have done more for us or with a more perfect courtesy â come observed the countess smiling i see my vampire is only some millionaire who has taken the appearance of lara in order to avoid being confounded with de rothschild and you have seen her â her 20183m the beautiful greek of yesterday â no we heard i think the sound of her guzla but she remained perfectly invisible â when you say invisible interrupted monsieur_albert â_it is only to keep up the mystery for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the white curtains â where was this window with white hangings asked the countess at the rospoli palace â the count had three window at the rospoli palace â_yes did you pass through the corso â_yes â well did you notice two window hung with yellow damask and one with white damask with a red cross those were the countâ window â why he must be a nabob do you know what those three window were worth â two or three hundred roman crowns â two or three thousand â the deuce â does his island produce him such a revenue â_it does not bring him a bajocco â then why did he purchase it â for a whim â he is an original then â in reality observed monsieur_albert he seemed to me somewhat eccentric were he at paris and a frequenter of the theatres i should say he was a poor devil literally mad this morning he made two or three exits worthy of didier or anthony at this moment a fresh visitor entered and according to custom m_franz_de_quesnel gave up his seat to him this circumstance had moreover the effect of changing the conversation an hour afterwards the two friend returned to their hotel
signor signor_pastrini had already set about procuring their disguises for the morrow and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied the next morning at nine oâ clock he entered franzâ room followed by a tailor who had eight or ten roman peasant costumes on his arm they selected two exactly alike and charged the tailor to sew on each of their hats about twenty yards of ribbon and to procure them two of the long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower order decorate themselves on fãªte day monsieur_albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dressâ a jacket and breeches of blue velvet silk stockings with clocks shoes with buckles and a silk waistcoat this picturesque attire set him off to great advantage and when he had bound the scarf around his waist and when his hat placed coquettishly on one side let fall on his shoulder a stream of ribbons m_franz_de_quesnel was forced to confess that costume has much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations the turks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes but are they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the chin and their red caps which make them look like a bottle of wine with a red seal m_franz_de_quesnel complimented monsieur_albert who looked at himself in the glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction they were thus engaged when the count_of_monte_cristo entered 20185m gentlemen said he although a companion is agreeable perfect freedom is sometimes still more agreeable i come to say that today and for the remainder of the carnival i leave the carriage entirely at your disposal
the host will tell you i have three or four more so that you will not inconvenience me in any way make use of it i pray you for your pleasure or your business the young man wished to decline but they could find no good reason for refusing an offer which was so agreeable to them the count_of_monte_cristo remained a quarter of an hour with them conversing on all subjects with the greatest ease he was as we have already said perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries a glance at the wall of his salon proved to m_franz_de_quesnel and monsieur_albert that he was a connoisseur of pictures a few word he let fall showed them that he was no stranger to the sciences and he seemed much occupied with chemistry the two friend did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given them it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of signor_pastrini they told him so frankly and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy monsieur_albert was charmed with the countâ manner and he was only prevented from recognizing him for a perfect gentleman by reason of his varied knowledge the permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening and monsieur_albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them at half past one they descended the coachman and footman had put on their livery over their disguises which gave them a more ridiculous appearance than ever and which gained them the applause of m_franz_de_quesnel and monsieur_albert
albert had fastened the faded bunch of violets to his button hole at the first sound of the bell they hastened into the corso by the via vittoria at the second turn a bunch of fresh violets thrown from a carriage filled with harlequins indicated to monsieur_albert that like himself and his friend the peasants had changed their costume also and whether it was the result of chance or whether a similar feeling had possessed them both while he had donned their costume they had assumed his monsieur_albert placed the fresh bouquet in his button hole but he kept the faded one in his hand and when he again met the calash he raised it to his lip an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fair lady who had thrown it but her joyous companions also the day was as gay as the preceding one perhaps even more animated and noisy the count appeared for an instant at his window but when they again passed he had disappeared it is almost needless to say that the flirtation between monsieur_albert and the fair peasant continued all day in the evening on his return m_franz_de_quesnel found a letter from the embassy informing him that he would have the honor of being received by his holiness the next day at each previous visit he had made to rome he had solicited and obtained the same favor and incited as much by a religious feeling as by gratitude he was unwilling to quit the capital of the christian world without laying his respectful homage at the foot of one of st peterâ successors who has set the rare example of all the virtues
he did not then think of the carnival for in spite of his condescension and touching kindness one cannot incline oneâ self without awe before the venerable and noble old man called gregory xvi on his return from the vatican m_franz_de_quesnel carefully avoided the corso he brought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts to which the mad gayety of the maskers would have been profanation at ten minute past five monsieur_albert entered overjoyed the harlequin had reassumed her peasantâ costume and as she passed she raised her mask she was charming m_franz_de_quesnel congratulated monsieur_albert who received his congratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited he had recognized by certain unmistakable signs that his fair incognita belonged to the aristocracy he had made up his mind to write to her the next day m_franz_de_quesnel remarked while he gave these details that monsieur_albert seemed to have something to ask of him but that he was unwilling to ask it he insisted upon it declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any sacrifice the other wished monsieur_albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowed to m_franz_de_quesnel that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day monsieur_albert attributed to franzâ absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask m_franz_de_quesnel was not sufficiently egotistical to stop monsieur_albert in the middle of an adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so flattering to his vanity
he felt assured that the perfect indiscretion of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened and as during three year that he had travelled all over italy a similar piece of good fortune had never fallen to his share m_franz_de_quesnel was by no means sorry to learn how to act on such an occasion he therefore promised monsieur_albert that he would content himself the morrow with witnessing the carnival from the window of the rospoli palace the next morning he saw monsieur_albert pass and repass holding an enormous bouquet which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous epistle this belief was changed into certainty when m_franz_de_quesnel saw the bouquet conspicuous by a circle of white camellias in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rose colored satin the evening was no longer joy but delirium monsieur_albert nothing doubted but that the fair unknown would reply in the same manner m_franz_de_quesnel anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal monsieur_albert was not deceived for the next evening m_franz_de_quesnel saw him enter triumphantly shaking a folded paper which he held by one corner well said he was i mistaken â she has answered you cried m_franz_de_quesnel read this word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe m_franz_de_quesnel took the letter and read tuesday evening at seven oâ clock descend from your carriage opposite the via dei pontefici and follow the roman peasant who snatches your torch from you when you arrive at the first step of the church of san giacomo be sure to fasten a knot of rose colored ribbons to the shoulder of your harlequin costume in order that you may be recognized
until then you will not see me constancy and discretion â well asked he when m_franz_de_quesnel had finished what do you think of that â i think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance â i think so also replied monsieur_albert and i very much fear you will go alone to the duke of braccianoâ ball m_franz_de_quesnel and monsieur_albert had received that morning an invitation from the celebrated roman banker take care monsieur_albert said m_franz_de_quesnel all the nobility of rome will be present and if your fair incognita belong to the higher class of society she must go there â whether she goes there or not my opinion is still the same returned monsieur_albert you have read the letter â_yes â you know how imperfectly the woman of the mezzo cito are educated in italy this is the name of the lower class â_yes â well read the letter again look at the writing and find if you can any blemish in the language or orthography the writing was in reality charming and the orthography irreproachable you are born to good fortune said m_franz_de_quesnel as he returned the letter laugh as much as you will replied monsieur_albert i am in love â you alarm me cried m_franz_de_quesnel i see that i shall not only go alone to the duke of braccianoâ but also return to florence alone â if my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful said monsieur_albert i shall fix myself at rome for six weeks at least i adore rome and i have always had a great taste for archã ology 20189m come two or three more such adventures and i do not despair of seeing you a member of the academy doubtless monsieur_albert was about to discuss seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that dinner was ready
albertâ love had not taken away his appetite he hastened with m_franz_de_quesnel to seat himself free to recommence the discussion after dinner after dinner the count_of_monte_cristo was announced they had not seen him for two day signor_pastrini informed them that business had called him to civita vecchia he had started the previous evening and had only returned an hour since he was charming whether he kept a watch over himself or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched he was tonight like everybody else the man was an enigma to m_franz_de_quesnel the count must feel sure that m_franz_de_quesnel recognized him and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between them on his side however great franzâ desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it the count had learned that the two friend had sent to secure a box at the argentina theatre and were told they were all let in consequence he brought them the key of his ownâ at least such was the apparent motive of his visit m_franz_de_quesnel and monsieur_albert made some difficulty alleging their fear of depriving him of it but the count replied that as he was going to the palli theatre the box at the argentina theatre would be lost if they did not profit by it this assurance determined the two friend to accept it m_franz_de_quesnel had by degrees become accustomed to the countâ pallor which had so forcibly struck him at their first meeting
he could not refrain from admiring the severe beauty of his features the only defect or rather the principal quality of which was the pallor truly a byronic hero m_franz_de_quesnel could not we will not say see him but even think of him without imagining his stern head upon manfredâ shoulders or beneath laraâ helmet his forehead was marked with the line that indicates the constant presence of bitter thoughts he had the fiery eye that seem to penetrate to the very soul and the haughty and disdainful upper lip that gives to the word it utters a peculiar character that impresses them on the mind of those to whom they are addressed the count was no longer young he was at least forty and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young man with whom he associated at present and to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the english poet the count seemed to have the power of fascination monsieur_albert was constantly expatiating on their good fortune in meeting such a man m_franz_de_quesnel was less enthusiastic but the count exercised over him also the ascendency a strong mind always acquires over a mind less domineering he thought several time of the project the count had of visiting paris and he had no doubt but that with his eccentric character his characteristic face and his colossal fortune he would produce a great effect there and yet he did not wish to be at paris when the count was there the evening passed as evening mostly pass at italian theatres that is not in listening to the music but in paying visits and conversing
the countess gâ wished to revive the subject of the count but m_franz_de_quesnel announced he had something far newer to tell her and in spite of albertâ demonstrations of false modesty he informed the countess of the great event which had preoccupied them for the last three day as similar intrigues are not uncommon in italy if we may credit travellers the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity but congratulated monsieur_albert on his success they promised upon separating to meet at the duke of braccianoâ ball to which all rome was invited the heroine of the bouquet kept her word she gave monsieur_albert no sign of her existence the morrow or the day after at length tuesday came the last and most tumultuous day of the carnival on tuesday the theatres open at ten oâ clock in the morning as lent begins after eight at night on tuesday all those who through want of money time or enthusiasm have not been to see the carnival before mingle in the gayety and contribute to the noise and excitement from two oâ clock till five m_franz_de_quesnel and monsieur_albert followed in the fãªte exchanging handfuls of confetti with the other carriage and the pedestrians who crowded amongst the horsesâ foot and the carriage wheels without a single accident a single dispute or a single fight the fãªtes are veritable pleasure day to the italians the author of this history who has resided five or six year in italy does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other countries monsieur_albert was triumphant in his harlequin costume a knot of rose colored ribbons fell from his shoulder almost to the ground in order that there might be no confusion m_franz_de_quesnel wore his peasantâ costume
as the day advanced the tumult became greater there was not on the pavement in the carriage at the window a single tongue that was silent a single arm that did not move it was a human storm made up of a thunder of cries and a hail of sweetmeats flowers eggs oranges and nosegays at three oâ clock the sound of fireworks let off on the piazza del popolo and the piazza di venezia heard with difficulty amid the din and confusion announced that the races were about to begin the races like the moccoli are one of the episodes peculiar to the last day of the carnival at the sound of the fireworks the carriage instantly broke ranks and retired by the adjacent streets all these evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous rapidity without the police interfering in the matter the pedestrians ranged themselves against the wall then the trampling of horse and the clashing of steel were heard a detachment of carbineers fifteen abreast galloped up the corso in order to clear it for the barberi when the detachment arrived at the piazza di venezia a second volley of fireworks was discharged to announce that the street was clear almost instantly in the midst of a tremendous and general outcry seven or eight horse excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand spectators passed by like lightning then the castle of saint angelo fired three cannon to indicate that number three had won immediately without any other signal the carriage moved on flowing on towards the corso down all the streets like torrents pent up for a while which again flow into the parent river and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite banks
a new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd the sellers of moccoletti entered on the scene the moccoli or moccoletti are candles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight and which give to each actor in the great final scene of the carnival two very serious problems to grapple with first how to keep his own moccoletto alight and secondly how to extinguish the moccoletti of others the moccoletto is like life man has found but one means of transmitting it and that one comes from god but he has discovered a thousand means of taking it away and the devil has somewhat aided him the moccoletto is kindled by approaching it to a light but who can describe the thousand means of extinguishing the moccoletto the gigantic bellows the monstrous extinguishers the superhuman fans everyone hastened to purchase moccoletti m_franz_de_quesnel and monsieur_albert among the rest the night was rapidly approaching and already at the cry of moccoletti repeated by the shrill voice of a thousand vendors two or three stars began to burn among the crowd it was a signal at the end of ten minute fifty thousand light glittered descending from the palazzo di venezia to the piazza del popolo and mounting from the piazza del popolo to the palazzo di venezia it seemed like the fãªte of jack oâ lanterns it is impossible to form any idea of it without having seen it suppose that all the stars had descended from the sky and mingled in a wild dance on the face of the earth the whole accompanied by cries that were never heard in any other part of the world the facchino follows the prince the transteverin the citizen everyone blowing extinguishing relighting
had old olus appeared at this moment he would have been proclaimed king of the moccoli and aquilo the heir presumptive to the throne this battle of folly and flame continued for two hour the corso was light as day the features of the spectators on the third and fourth stories were visible every five minute monsieur_albert took out his watch at length it pointed to seven the two friend were in the via dei pontefici monsieur_albert sprang out bearing his moccoletto in his hand two or three masks strove to knock his moccoletto out of his hand but monsieur_albert a first rate pugilist sent them rolling in the street one after the other and continued his course towards the church of san giacomo the step were crowded with masks who strove to snatch each otherâ torches m_franz_de_quesnel followed monsieur_albert with his eye and saw him mount the first step instantly a mask wearing the well known costume of a peasant woman snatched his moccoletto from him without his offering any resistance m_franz_de_quesnel was too far off to hear what they said but without doubt nothing hostile passed for he saw monsieur_albert disappear arm in arm with the peasant girl he watched them pass through the crowd for some time but at length he lost sight of them in the via macello suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the carnival sounded and at the same instant all the moccoletti were extinguished as if by enchantment it seemed as though one immense blast of the wind had extinguished everyone m_franz_de_quesnel found himself in utter darkness no sound was audible save that of the carriage that were carrying the maskers home nothing was visible save a few light that burnt behind the window the carnival was over 20193m chapter 37
the catacombs of saint sebastian in his whole life perhaps m_franz_de_quesnel had never before experienced so sudden an impression so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness as in this moment it seemed as though rome under the magic breath of some demon of the night had suddenly changed into a vast tomb by a chance which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness the moon which was on the wane did not rise until eleven oâ clock and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity the distance was short and at the end of ten minute his carriage or rather the countâ stopped before the hã tel de londres dinner was waiting but as monsieur_albert had told him that he should not return so soon m_franz_de_quesnel sat down without him signor_pastrini who had been accustomed to see them dine together inquired into the cause of his absence but m_franz_de_quesnel merely replied that monsieur_albert had received on the previous evening an invitation which he had accepted the sudden extinction of the moccoletti the darkness which had replaced the light and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil had left in franzâ mind a certain depression which was not free from uneasiness he therefore dined very silently in spite of the officious attention of his host who presented himself two or three time to inquire if he wanted anything m_franz_de_quesnel resolved to wait for monsieur_albert as late as possible he ordered the carriage therefore for eleven oâ clock desiring signor_pastrini to inform him the moment that monsieur_albert returned to the hotel at eleven oâ clock monsieur_albert had not come back m_franz_de_quesnel dressed himself and went out telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the duke of braccianoâ
the house_of_peers of the duke of bracciano is one of the most delightful in rome the duchess one of the last heiresses of the colonnas does its honor with the most consummate grace and thus their fãªtes have a european celebrity m_franz_de_quesnel and monsieur_albert had brought to rome letter of introduction to them and their first question on his arrival was to inquire the whereabouts of his travelling companion m_franz_de_quesnel replied that he had left him at the moment they were about to extinguish the moccoli and that he had lost sight of him in the via macello then he has not returned said the duke i waited for him until this hour replied m_franz_de_quesnel and do you know whither he went â no not precisely however i think it was something very like a rendezvous â diavolo said the duke this is a bad day or rather a bad night to be out late is it not countess these word were addressed to the countess gâ who had just arrived and was leaning on the arm of signor torlonia the dukeâ brother i think on the contrary that it is a charming night replied the countess and those who are here will complain of but one thing that of its too rapid flight â i am not speaking said the duke with a smile of
the person who are here the man run no other danger than that of falling in love with you and the woman of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely i meant person who were out in the streets of rome â ah asked the countess who is out in the streets of rome at this hour unless it be to go to a ball â our friend monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf countess whom i left in pursuit of his unknown about seven oâ clock this evening said m_franz_de_quesnel and whom i have not seen since â and donâ you know where he is â not at all â is he armed â he is in masquerade â you should not have allowed him to go said the duke to m_franz_de_quesnel you who know rome better than he does â you might as well have tried to stop number three of the barberi who gained the prize in the race today replied m_franz_de_quesnel and then moreover what could happen to him â who can tell the night is gloomy and the tiber is very near the via macello m_franz_de_quesnel felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal disquietude i informed them at the hotel that i had the honor of passing the night here duke said m_franz_de_quesnel and desired them to come and inform me of his return â ah replied the duke here i think is one of my servant who is seeking you the duke was not mistaken when he saw m_franz_de_quesnel the servant came up to him your excellency
he said the master of the hã tel de londres has sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from the viscount of viscount_albert_de_morcerf â a letter from the viscount exclaimed m_franz_de_quesnel â_yes â and who is the man â i do not know â why did he not bring it to me here â the messenger did not say â and where is the messenger â he went away directly he saw me enter the ball room to find you â_oh said the countess to m_franz_de_quesnel go with all speedâ poor young man perhaps some accident has happened to him â i will hasten replied m_franz_de_quesnel shall we see you again to give us any information inquired the countess â_yes if it is not any serious affair otherwise i cannot answer as to what i may do myself â be prudent in any event said the countess â_oh pray be assured of that m_franz_de_quesnel took his hat and went away in haste he had sent away his carriage with order for it to fetch him at two oâ clock fortunately the palazzo bracciano which is on one side in the corso and on the other in the square of the holy apostles is hardly ten minutesâ walk from the hã tel de londres as he came near the hotel m_franz_de_quesnel saw a man in the middle of the street he had no doubt that it was the messenger from monsieur_albert the man was wrapped up in a large cloak he went up to him but to his extreme astonishment the stranger first addressed him what wants your excellency of me inquired the man retreating a step or two as if to keep on his guard
â are not you the person who brought me a letter inquired m_franz_de_quesnel from the viscount of viscount_albert_de_morcerf â your excellency lodges at pastriniâ hotel â i do â your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount â i am â your excellencyâ nameâ â is the baron m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay 20199m then it is to your excellency that this letter is addressed â is there any answer inquired m_franz_de_quesnel taking the letter from him yesâ your friend at least hopes so â come upstairs with me and i will give it to you â i prefer waiting here said the messenger with a smile and why â your excellency will know when you have read the letter â shall i find you here then â certainly m_franz_de_quesnel entered the hotel on the staircase he met signor_pastrini well said the landlord wellâ what responded m_franz_de_quesnel you have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend he asked of m_franz_de_quesnel â_yes i have seen him he replied and he has handed this letter to me light the candles in my apartment if you please the innkeeper gave order to a servant to go before m_franz_de_quesnel with a light the young man had found signor_pastrini looking very much alarmed and this had only made him the more anxious to read albertâ letter and so he went instantly towards the waxlight and unfolded it it was written and signed by monsieur_albert m_franz_de_quesnel read it twice before he could comprehend what it contained it was thus worded my dear fellow the moment you have received this have the kindness to take the letter of credit from my pocket book which you will find in the square drawer of the secrã taire add your own to it if it be not sufficient
run to torlonia draw from him instantly four thousand piastres and give them to the bearer it is urgent that i should have this money without delay i do not say more relying on you as you may rely on me your friend monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf p â i now believe in italian banditti below these lines were written in a strange hand the following in italian se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte alberto avrã cessato di vivere luigi_vampa â if by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my hand by seven oâ clock the count monsieur_albert will have ceased to live this second signature explained everything to m_franz_de_quesnel who now understood the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment the street was safer for him monsieur_albert then had fallen into the hand of the famous bandit chief in whose existence he had for so long a time refused to believe there was no time to lose he hastened to open the secrã taire and found the pocket book in the drawer and in it the letter of credit there were in all six thousand piastres but of these six thousand monsieur_albert had already expended three thousand as to m_franz_de_quesnel he had no letter of credit as he lived at florence and had only come to rome to pass seven or eight day he had brought but a hundred louis_xviii and of these he had not more than fifty left thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that monsieur_albert required true he might in such a case rely on the kindness of signor torlonia
he was therefore about to return to the palazzo bracciano without loss of time when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind he remembered the count_of_monte_cristo m_franz_de_quesnel was about to ring for signor_pastrini when that worthy presented himself my dear sir he said hastily do you know if the count is within â_yes your excellency he has this moment returned â is he in bed â i should say no â then ring at his door if you please and request him to be so kind as to give me an audience signor_pastrini did as he was desired and returning five minute after he said the count awaits your excellency m_franz_de_quesnel went along the corridor and a servant introduced him to the count he was in a small room which m_franz_de_quesnel had not yet seen and which was surrounded with divans the count came towards him well what good wind blows you hither at this hour said he have you come to sup with me it would be very kind of you â no i have come to speak to you of a very serious matter â a serious matter said the count looking at m_franz_de_quesnel with the earnestness usual to him and what may it be â are we alone â_yes replied the count going to the door and returning m_franz_de_quesnel gave him albertâ letter read that he said the count read it well well said he did you see the postscript â i did indeed â se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte alberto avrã cessato di vivere â luigi_vampa â what think you of that inquired m_franz_de_quesnel have you the money he demands â_yes all but eight hundred piastres
the count went to his secrã taire opened it and pulling out a drawer filled with gold said to m_franz_de_quesnel i hope you will not offend me by applying to anyone but myself â you see on the contrary i come to you first and instantly replied m_franz_de_quesnel and i thank you have what you will and he made a sign to m_franz_de_quesnel to take what he pleased is it absolutely necessary then to send the money to luigi_vampa asked the young man looking fixedly in his turn at the count judge for yourself replied he the postscript is explicit â i think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting you could find a way of simplifying the negotiation said m_franz_de_quesnel how so returned the count with surprise if we were to go together to luigi_vampa i am sure he would not refuse you albertâ freedom â what influence can i possibly have over a bandit â have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten â what is that â have you not saved peppinoâ life â well well said the count who told you that â no matter i know it the count knit his brows and remained silent an instant and if i went to seek luigi_vampa would you accompany me â if my society would not be disagreeable â be it so it is a lovely night and a walk without rome will do us both good â shall i take any arm â for what purpose â any money â_it is useless where is the man who brought the letter â in the street â he awaits the answer â_yes â i must learn where we are going i will summon him hither â_it is useless he would not come up â to
your apartments perhaps but he will not make any difficulty at entering mine the count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the street and whistled in a peculiar manner the man in the mantle quitted the wall and advanced into the middle of the street salite said the count in the same tone in which he would have given an order to his servant the messenger obeyed without the least hesitation but rather with alacrity and mounting the step at a bound entered the hotel five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the room ah it is you peppino said the count but peppino instead of answering threw himself on his knees seized the countâ hand and covered it with kisses ah said the count you have then not forgotten that i saved your life that is strange for it is a week ago 20203m no excellency and never shall i forget it returned peppino with an accent of profound gratitude never that is a long time but it is something that you believe so rise and answer peppino glanced anxiously at m_franz_de_quesnel â_oh you may speak before his excellency said he he is one of my friend you allow me to give you this title continued the count in french â_it is necessary to excite this manâ confidence â you can speak before me said m_franz_de_quesnel i am a friend of the countâ â good returned peppino i am ready to answer any questions your excellency may address to me â how did the viscount monsieur_albert fall into luigiâ hand â excellency the frenchmanâ carriage passed several time the one in which was _teresa â the chiefâ mistress â_yes
the frenchman threw her a bouquet _teresa returned itâ all this with the consent of the chief who was in the carriage â what cried m_franz_de_quesnel was luigi_vampa in the carriage with the roman peasants â_it was he who drove disguised as the coachman replied peppino well said the count well then the frenchman took off his mask _teresa with the chiefâ consent did the same the frenchman asked for a rendezvous _teresa gave him oneâ only instead of _teresa it was beppo who was on the step of the church of san giacomo â what exclaimed m_franz_de_quesnel the peasant girl who snatched his mocoletto from himâ â was a lad of fifteen replied peppino but it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived beppo has taken in plenty of others â and beppo led him outside the wall said the count exactly so a carriage was waiting at the end of the via macello beppo got in inviting the frenchman to follow him and he did not wait to be asked twice he gallantly offered the right hand seat to beppo and sat by him beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from rome the frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the world the coachman went up the via di ripetta and the porta san paolo and when they were two hundred yards outside as the frenchman became somewhat too forward beppo put a brace of pistols to his head the coachman pulled up and did the same at the same time four of the band who were concealed on the banks of the almo surrounded the carriage the frenchman made some resistance and nearly strangled beppo but he could not resist five armed man and was forced to yield
they made him get out walk along the banks of the river and then brought him to _teresa and luigi_vampa who were waiting for him in the catacombs of st sebastian â well said the count turning towards m_franz_de_quesnel â_it seems to me that this is a very likely story what do you say to it â why that i should think it very amusing replied m_franz_de_quesnel if it had happened to anyone but poor monsieur_albert â and in truth if you had not found me here said the count â_it might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear but now be assured his alarm will be the only serious consequence â and shall we go and find him inquired m_franz_de_quesnel â_oh decidedly sir he is in a very picturesque placeâ do you know the catacombs of st sebastian â i was never in them but i have often resolved to visit them â well here is an opportunity made to your hand and it would be difficult to contrive a better have you a carriage â no â that is of no consequence i always have one ready day and night â always ready â_yes i am a very capricious being and i should tell you that sometimes when i rise or after my dinner or in the middle of the night i resolve on starting for some particular point and away i go the count rang and a footman appeared order out the carriage he said and remove the pistols which are in the holsters you need not awaken the coachman ali_pasha_of_yanina will drive in a very short time the noise of wheels was heard and the carriage stopped at the door the count took out his watch half past twelve he said
â we might start at five oâ clock and be in time but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night and therefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the hand of the infidels are you still resolved to accompany me â more determined than ever â well then come along m_franz_de_quesnel and the count went downstairs accompanied by peppino at the door they found the carriage ali_pasha_of_yanina was on the box in whom m_franz_de_quesnel recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of count_of_monte_cristo m_franz_de_quesnel and the count got into the carriage peppino placed himself beside ali_pasha_of_yanina and they set off at a rapid pace ali_pasha_of_yanina had received his instructions and went down the corso crossed the campo vaccino went up the strada san gregorio and reached the gates of st sebastian then the porter raised some difficulties but the count_of_monte_cristo produced a permit from the governor of rome allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of the day or night the portcullis was therefore raised the porter had a louis_xviii for his trouble and they went on their way the road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient appian way and bordered with tombs from time to time by the light of the moon which began to rise m_franz_de_quesnel imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from peppino a short time before they reached the baths of caracalla the carriage stopped peppino opened the door and the count and m_franz_de_quesnel alighted in ten minute said the count to his companion we shall be there
he then took peppino aside gave him an order in a low voice and peppino went away taking with him a torch brought with them in the carriage five minute elapsed during which m_franz_de_quesnel saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the campagna and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion now said the count let us follow him m_franz_de_quesnel and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path which at the distance of a hundred paces led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small valley they then perceived two man conversing in the obscurity ought we to go on asked m_franz_de_quesnel of the count or should we pause â let us go on peppino will have warned the sentry of our coming one of the two man was peppino and the other a bandit on the lookout m_franz_de_quesnel and the count advanced and the bandit saluted them your excellency said peppino addressing the count if you will follow me the opening of the catacombs is close at hand â go on then replied the count they came to an opening behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks by which a man could scarcely pass peppino glided first into this crevice after they got along a few paces the passage widened peppino passed lighted his torch and turned to see if they came after him the count first reached an open space and m_franz_de_quesnel followed him closely
the passageway sloped in a gentle descent enlarging as they proceeded still m_franz_de_quesnel and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one another they went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way and then were stopped by who comes there at the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel a friend responded peppino and advancing alone towards the sentry he said a few word to him in a low tone and then he like the first saluted the nocturnal visitors making a sign that they might proceed behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty step m_franz_de_quesnel and the count descended these and found themselves in a mortuary chamber five corridors diverged like the rays of a star and the wall dug into niches which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins showed that they were at last in the catacombs down one of the corridors whose extent it was impossible to determine rays of light were visible the count laid his hand on franzâ shoulder would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose he inquired exceedingly replied m_franz_de_quesnel come with me then peppino put out the torch peppino obeyed and m_franz_de_quesnel and the count were in utter darkness except that fifty paces in advance of them a reddish glare more evident since peppino had put out his torch was visible along the wall they advanced silently the count guiding m_franz_de_quesnel as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the dark m_franz_de_quesnel himself however saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light which served in some manner as a guide
three arcades were before them and the middle one was used as a door these arcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and m_franz_de_quesnel were and on the other into a large square chamber entirely surrounded by niches similar to those of which we have spoken in the midst of this chamber were four stones which had formerly served as an altar as was evident from the cross which still surmounted them a lamp placed at the base of a pillar lighted up with its pale and flickering flame the singular scene which presented itself to the eye of the two visitors concealed in the shadow a man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column and was reading with his back turned to the arcades through the openings of which the new comers contemplated him this was the chief of the band luigi_vampa around him and in groups according to their fancy lying in their mantles or with their backs against a sort of stone bench which went all round the columbarium were to be seen twenty brigands or more each having his carbine within reach at the other end silent scarcely visible and like a shadow was a sentinel who was walking up and down before a grotto which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere when the count thought m_franz_de_quesnel had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau he raised his finger to his lip to warn him to be silent and ascending the three step which led to the corridor of the columbarium entered the chamber by the middle arcade and advanced towards luigi_vampa who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his footsteps
â who comes there cried the sentinel who was less abstracted and who saw by the lamp light a shadow approaching his chief at this challenge luigi_vampa rose quickly drawing at the same moment a pistol from his girdle in a moment all the bandits were on their foot and twenty carbines were levelled at the count well said he in a voice perfectly calm and no muscle of his countenance disturbed well my dear luigi_vampa it appears to me that you receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony 20207m ground arm exclaimed the chief with an imperative sign of the hand while with the other he took off his hat respectfully then turning to the singular personage who had caused this scene he said your pardon your excellency but i was so far from expecting the honor of a visit that i did not really recognize you â_it seems that your memory is equally short in everything luigi_vampa said the count and that not only do you forget peopleâ face but also the conditions you make with them â what conditions have i forgotten your excellency inquired the bandit with the air of a man who having committed an error is anxious to repair it was it not agreed asked the count that not only my person but also that of my friend should be respected by you â and how have i broken that treaty your excellency â you have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the viscount monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf
well continued the count in a tone that made m_franz_de_quesnel shudder this young gentleman is one of my friend this young gentleman lodges in the same hotel as myselfâ this young gentleman has been up and down the corso for eight hour in my private carriage and yet i repeat to you you have carried him off and conveyed him hither and added the count taking the letter from his pocket you have set a ransom on him as if he were an utter stranger â why did you not tell me all thisâ you inquired the brigand chief turning towards his man who all retreated before his look why have you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the count who has all our life in his hand by heavens if i thought one of you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his excellency i would blow his brains out with my own hand 20211m well said the count turning towards m_franz_de_quesnel i told you there was some mistake in this â are you not alone asked luigi_vampa with uneasiness i am with the person to whom this letter was addressed and to whom i desired to prove that luigi_vampa was a man of his word come your excellency the count added turning to m_franz_de_quesnel here is luigi_vampa who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has committed m_franz_de_quesnel approached the chief advancing several step to meet him welcome among us your excellency
he said to him you heard what the count just said and also my reply let me add that i would not for the four thousand piastres at which i had fixed your friendâ ransom that this had happened â but said m_franz_de_quesnel looking round him uneasily where is the viscount i do not see him â nothing has happened to him i hope said the count frowningly the prisoner is there replied luigi_vampa pointing to the hollow space in front of which the bandit was on guard and i will go myself and tell him he is free the chief went towards the place he had pointed out as albertâ prison and m_franz_de_quesnel and the count followed him what is the prisoner doing inquired luigi_vampa of the sentinel ma foi captain replied the sentry i do not know for the last hour i have not heard him stir â come in your excellency said luigi_vampa the count and m_franz_de_quesnel ascended seven or eight step after the chief who drew back a bolt and opened a door then by the gleam of a lamp similar to that which lighted the columbarium monsieur_albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of the bandits had lent him lying in a corner in profound slumber come said the count smiling with his own peculiar smile not so bad for a man who is to be shot at seven oâ clock tomorrow morning luigi_vampa looked at monsieur_albert with a kind of admiration he was not insensible to such a proof of courage you are right your excellency he said this must be one of your friend
then going to monsieur_albert he touched him on the shoulder saying will your excellency please to awaken monsieur_albert stretched out his arm rubbed his eyelids and opened his eye â_oh said he is it you captain you should have allowed me to sleep i had such a delightful dream i was dancing the galop at torloniaâ with the countess gâ â then he drew his watch from his pocket that he might see how time sped half past one only said he why the devil do you rouse me at this hour â to tell you that you are free your excellency â my dear fellow replied monsieur_albert with perfect ease of mind remember for the future napoleonâ maxim never awaken me but for bad news if you had let me sleep on i should have finished my galop and have been grateful to you all my life so then they have paid my ransom â no your excellency â well then how am i free â a person to whom i can refuse nothing has come to demand you â come hither â_yes hither â really then that person is a most amiable person monsieur_albert looked around and perceived m_franz_de_quesnel what said he is it you my dear m_franz_de_quesnel whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed â no not i replied m_franz_de_quesnel but our neighbor the count_of_monte_cristo â_oh my dear count said monsieur_albert gayly arranging his cravat and wristbands you are really most kind and i hope you will consider me as under eternal obligations to you in the first place for the carriage and in the next for this visit and he put out his hand to the count who shuddered as he gave his own but who nevertheless did give it
the bandit gazed on this scene with amazement he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him and yet here was one whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered as for m_franz_de_quesnel he was enchanted at the way in which monsieur_albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the bandit my dear monsieur_albert he said if you will make haste we shall yet have time to finish the night at torloniaâ you may conclude your interrupted galop so that you will owe no ill will to signor luigi_vampa who has indeed throughout this whole affair acted like a gentleman â you are decidedly right and we may reach the palazzo by two oâ clock signor luigi_vampa continued monsieur_albert is there any formality to fulfil before i take leave of your excellency â none sir replied the bandit you are as free as air â well then a happy and merry life to you come gentlemen come and monsieur_albert followed by m_franz_de_quesnel and the count descended the staircase crossed the square chamber where stood all the bandits hat in hand peppino said the brigand chief give me the torch â what are you going to do inquired the count i will show you the way back myself said the captain that is the least honor that i can render to your excellency and taking the lighted torch from the hand of the herdsman he preceded his guests not as a servant who performs an act of civility but like a king who precedes ambassadors on reaching the door he bowed
â and now your excellency added he allow me to repeat my apologies and i hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has occurred â no my dear luigi_vampa replied the count besides you compensate for your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way that one almost feels obliged to you for having committed them 20214m gentlemen added the chief turning towards the young man perhaps the offer may not appear very tempting to you but if you should ever feel inclined to pay me a second visit wherever i may be you shall be welcome m_franz_de_quesnel and monsieur_albert bowed the count went out first then monsieur_albert m_franz_de_quesnel paused for a moment has your excellency anything to ask me said luigi_vampa with a smile â_yes i have replied m_franz_de_quesnel i am curious to know what work you were perusing with so much attention as we entered â cã sarâ commentaries said the bandit â_it is my favorite work â well are you coming asked monsieur_albert â_yes replied m_franz_de_quesnel here i am and he in his turn left the caves they advanced to the plain ah your pardon said monsieur_albert turning round will you allow me captain and he lighted his cigar at vampaâ torch now my dear count he said let us on with all the speed we may i am enormously anxious to finish my night at the duke of braccianoâ â they found the carriage where they had left it the count said a word in arabic to ali_pasha_of_yanina and the horse went on at great speed it was just two oâ clock by albertâ watch when the two friend entered into the dancing room their return was quite an event but as they entered together all uneasiness on albertâ account ceased instantly
â madame said the viscount of viscount_albert_de_morcerf advancing towards the countess yesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop i am rather late in claiming this gracious promise but here is my friend whose character for veracity you well know and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine and as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz monsieur_albert put his arm round the waist of the countess and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers in the meanwhile m_franz_de_quesnel was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the count_of_monte_cristo at the moment when he had been in some sort forced to give his hand to monsieur_albert chapter 38 the rendezvous the first word that monsieur_albert uttered to his friend on the following morning contained a request that m_franz_de_quesnel would accompany him on a visit to the count true the young man had warmly and energetically thanked the count on the previous evening but services such as he had rendered could never be too often acknowledged m_franz_de_quesnel who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to albertâ request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon my
dear count said monsieur_albert advancing to meet him permit me to repeat the poor thanks i offered last night and to assure you that the remembrance of all i owe to you will never be effaced from my memory believe me as long as i live i shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the prompt and important service you rendered me and also to remember that to you i am indebted even for my life â my very good friend and excellent neighbor replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exertions you owe me nothing but some trifle of 20 000 franc which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses so that there is not much of a score between us but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take â upon my word said monsieur_albert i deserve no credit for what i could not help namely a determination to take everything as i found it and to let those bandits see that although man get into troublesome scrapes all over the world there is no nation but the french that can smile even in the face of grim death himself all that however has nothing to do with my obligations to you and i now come to ask you whether in my own person my family or connections i can in any way serve you
my father the comte de viscount_albert_de_morcerf although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i unhesitatingly place the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal â monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf replied the count your offer far from surprising me is precisely what i expected from you and i accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made nay i will go still further and say that i had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hand â_oh pray name it â i am wholly a stranger to parisâ it is a city i have never yet seen â is it possible exclaimed monsieur_albert that you have reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world
i can scarcely credit it â nevertheless it is quite true still i agree with you in thinking that my present ignorance of the first city in europe is a reproach to me in every way and calls for immediate correction but in all probability i should have performed so important so necessary a duty as that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of your justly celebrated capital had i known any person who would have introduced me into the fashionable world but unfortunately i possessed no acquaintance there and of necessity was compelled to abandon the idea â so distinguished an individual as yourself cried monsieur_albert could scarcely have required an introduction â you are most kind but as regards myself i can find no merit i possess save that as a millionaire i might have become a partner in the speculations of aguado and rothschild but as my motive in travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of dabbling in stocks i stayed away till some favorable chance should present itself of carrying my wish into execution your offer however smooths all difficulties and i have only to ask you my dear de morcerfâ these word were accompanied by a most peculiar smile whether you undertake upon my arrival in france to open to me the door of that fashionable world of which i know no more than a huron or a native of cochin china â_oh that i do and with infinite pleasure answered monsieur_albert and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father summons me to paris in consequence of a treaty of marriage
my dear m_franz_de_quesnel do not smile i beg of you with a family of high standing and connected with the very cream of parisian society â connected by marriage you mean said m_franz_de_quesnel laughingly well never mind how it is answered monsieur_albert â_it comes to the same thing in the end perhaps by the time you return to paris i shall be quite a sober staid father of a family a most edifying representative i shall make of all the domestic virtuesâ donâ you think so but as regards your wish to visit our fine city my dear count i can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please â then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated m_franz_de_quesnel did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few word in the grotto of count_of_monte_cristo and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely hoping to read something of his purpose in his face but his countenance was inscrutable especially when as in the present case it was veiled in a sphinx like smile
â but tell me now count exclaimed monsieur_albert delighted at the idea of having to chaperon so distinguished a person as count_of_monte_cristo tell me truly whether you are in earnest or if this project of visiting paris is merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many in the course of our life but which like a house_of_peers built on the sand is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind â i pledge you my honor returned the count that i mean to do as i have said both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit paris â when do you propose going thither â have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself â certainly i have in a fortnight or three weeksâ time that is to say as fast as i can get there â nay said the count i will give you three month ere i join you you see i make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties and in three monthsâ time said monsieur_albert you will be at my house_of_peers â shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements â day for day hour for hour said monsieur_albert that will suit me to a dot â so be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimney piece he said today is the 21st of february and drawing out his watch added â_it is exactly half past ten oâ clock
now promise me to remember this and expect me the 21st of may at the same hour in the forenoon â capital exclaimed monsieur_albert your breakfast shall be waiting â where do you live â no 27 rue du helder â have you bachelorâ apartments there i hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience â i reside in my fatherâ house_of_peers but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard entirely separated from the main building â quite sufficient replied the count as taking out his tablets he wrote down no 27 rue du helder 21st may half past ten in the morning â now then said the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your time piece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself â shall i see you again ere my departure asked monsieur_albert that depends when do you leave â tomorrow evening at five oâ clock â in that case i must say adieu to you as i am compelled to go to naples and shall not return hither before saturday evening or sunday morning and you baron pursued the count addressing m_franz_de_quesnel do you also depart tomorrow â_yes â for france â no for venice i shall remain in italy for another year or two â then we shall not meet in paris â i fear i shall not have that honor â well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young man allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey â_it was the first time the hand of m_franz_de_quesnel had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse 20219 m
â let us understand each other said monsieur_albert â_it is agreedâ is it not that you are to be at no 27 in the rue du helder on the 21st of may at half past ten in the morning and your word of honor passed for your punctuality â the 21st of may at half past ten in the morning rue du helder no 27 replied the count the young man then rose and bowing to the count quitted the room what is the matter asked monsieur_albert of m_franz_de_quesnel when they had returned to their own apartments you seem more than commonly thoughtful â i will confess to you monsieur_albert replied m_franz_de_quesnel the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions â my dear fellow exclaimed monsieur_albert what can there possibly be in that to excite uneasiness why you must have lost your senses â whether i am in my senses or not answered m_franz_de_quesnel that is the way i feel â listen to me m_franz_de_quesnel said monsieur_albert i am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you for i have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count while he on the other hand has always been courtesy itself to us have you anything particular against him â possibly â did you ever meet him previously to coming hither â i have â and where â will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what i am about to tell you â i promise â upon your honor â upon my honor â then listen to me m_franz_de_quesnel then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the island of count_of_monte_cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there and the two corsican bandits with them
he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the thousand and one night he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof or trace of all these events save the small yacht seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward porto vecchio then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum between the count and luigi_vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit peppino an engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled at last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result that followed monsieur_albert listened with the most profound attention well said he when m_franz_de_quesnel had concluded what do you find to object to in all you have related the count is fond of travelling and being rich possesses a vessel of his own go but to portsmouth or southampton and you will find the harbors crowded with the yachts belonging to such of the english as can afford the expense and have the same liking for this amusement
now by way of having a resting place during his excursions avoiding the wretched cookeryâ which has been trying its best to poison me during the last four month while you have manfully resisted its effects for as many year and obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber count_of_monte_cristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first found him but to prevent the possibility of the tuscan government taking a fancy to his enchanted palace and thereby depriving him of the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of capital he has wisely enough purchased the island and taken its name just ask yourself my good fellow whether there are not many person of our acquaintance who assume the name of lands and properties they never in their life were masters of â but said m_franz_de_quesnel the corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel â why really the thing seems to me simple enough nobody knows better than yourself that the bandits of corsica are not rogues or thieves but purely and simply fugitives driven by some sinister motive from their native town or village and that their fellowship involves no disgrace or stigma for my own part i protest that should i ever go to corsica my first visit ere even i presented myself to the mayor or prefect should be to the bandits of colomba if i could only manage to find them for on my conscience they are a race of man i admire greatly â still persisted m_franz_de_quesnel i suppose you will allow that such man as luigi_vampa and his band are regular villains who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your person
how do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians â my good friend as in all probability i own my present safety to that influence it would ill become me to search too closely into its source therefore instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such a connection not altogether for preserving my life for my own idea was that it never was in much danger but certainly for saving me 000 piastres which being translated means neither more nor less than 24 000 livres of our moneyâ a sum at which most assuredly i should never have been estimated in france proving most indisputably added monsieur_albert with a laugh that no prophet is honored in his own country â talking of countries replied m_franz_de_quesnel of what country is the count what is his native tongue whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early lifeâ a life as marvellous as unknownâ that have tinctured his succeeding year with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered â my dear m_franz_de_quesnel replied monsieur_albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the countâ assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf is in danger help me to deliver him was not that nearly what you said 20222m â_it was â well then did he ask you who is monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf how does he come by his nameâ his fortune what are his means of existence what is his birthplace of what country is he
a native tell me did he put all these questions to you â i confess he asked me none â no he merely came and freed me from the hand of signor luigi_vampa where i can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern i did not very particularly care to remain now then m_franz_de_quesnel when for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any russian prince or italian nobleman who may pass through parisâ merely to introduce him into societyâ would you have me refuse my good fellow you must have lost your senses to think it possible i could act with such cold blooded policy and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young man the effective arguments were all on albertâ side well said m_franz_de_quesnel with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation still in spite of all you must admit that this count_of_monte_cristo is a most singular personage â he is a philanthropist answered the other and no doubt his motive in visiting paris is to compete for the monthyon prize given as you are aware to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity if my vote and interest can obtain it for him i will readily give him the one and promise the other and now my dear m_franz_de_quesnel let us talk of something else come shall we take our luncheon and then pay a last visit to st peterâ â m_franz_de_quesnel silently assented and the following afternoon at half past five oâ clock the young man parted
albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf to return to paris and m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay to pass a fortnight at venice but ere he entered his travelling carriage monsieur_albert fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the count_of_monte_cristo on which beneath the name of viscount monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf he had written in pencil 27 rue du helder on the 21 st may half past ten a â chapter 39 the guests in the house_of_peers in the rue du helder where monsieur_albert had invited the count_of_monte_cristo everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st of may to do honor to the occasion monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at the corner of a large court and directly opposite another building in which were the servantsâ apartments two window only of the pavilion faced the street three other window looked into the court and two at the back into the garden between the court and the garden built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture was the large and fashionable dwelling of the count and countess of viscount_albert_de_morcerf a high wall surrounded the whole of the property surmounted at intervals by vases filled with flowers and broken in the centre by a large gate of gilded iron which served as the carriage entrance a small door close to the lodge of the concierge gave ingress and egress to the servant and masters when they were on foot
it was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother unwilling to part from her son and yet aware that a young man of the viscountâ age required the full exercise of his liberty had chosen this habitation for monsieur_albert there were not lacking however evidences of what we may call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent careless life of an only son and who life as it were in a gilded cage by means of the two window looking into the street monsieur_albert could see all that passed the sight of what is going on is necessary to young man who always want to see the world traverse their horizon even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the conciergeâ door and which merits a particular description it was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house_of_peers was built so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt but the well oiled hinges and locks told quite another story this door was a mockery to the concierge from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free and like that famous portal in the arabian night opening at the sesame of ali_pasha_of_yanina baba it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voice or whitest fingers in the world
at the end of a long corridor with which the door communicated and which formed the antechamber was on the right albertâ breakfast room looking into the court and on the left the salon looking into the garden shrubs and creeping plants covered the window and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only room into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eye of the curious could penetrate on the floor above were similar room with the addition of a third formed out of the antechamber these three room were a salon a boudoir and a bedroom the salon downstairs was only an algerian divan for the use of smokers the boudoir upstairs communicated with the bedchamber by an invisible door on the staircase it was evident that every precaution had been taken above this floor was a large atelier which had been increased in size by pulling down the partitionsâ a pandemonium in which the artist and the dandy strove for pre eminence there were collected and piled up all albertâ successive caprices hunting horns bass viols flutesâ a whole orchestra for monsieur_albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music easels palettes brushes pencilsâ for music had been succeeded by painting foils boxing gloves broadswords and single sticksâ for following the example of the fashionable young man of the time monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf cultivated with far more perseverance than music and drawing the three arts that complete a dandyâ education i fencing boxing and single stick and it was here that he received grisier cooks and charles leboucher the rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old cabinets filled with chinese porcelain and japanese vases lucca della robbia faã ences and palissy platters of old armchairs in which perhaps had sat henry iv
or sully louis_xviii xiii or richelieuâ for two of these armchairs adorned with a carved shield on which were engraved the fleur de lis of france on an azure field evidently came from the louvre or at least some royal residence over these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs dyed beneath persiaâ sun or woven by the fingers of the woman of calcutta or of chandernagor what these stuffs did there it was impossible to say they awaited while gratifying the eye a destination unknown to their owner himself in the meantime they filled the place with their golden and silky reflections in the centre of the room was a roller and blanchet baby grandâ piano in rosewood but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its narrow and sonorous cavity and groaning beneath the weight of the chefs dâ uvre of beethoven weber mozart haydn grã try and porpora on the wall over the door on the ceiling were swords daggers malay creeses maces battle axes gilded damasked and inlaid suits of armor dried plants minerals and stuffed birds their flame colored wings outspread in motionless flight and their beaks forever open this was albertâ favorite lounging place however the morning of the appointment the young man had established himself in the small salon downstairs
there on a table surrounded at some distance by a large and luxurious divan every species of tobacco known from the yellow tobacco of petersburg to the black of sinai and so on along the scale from maryland and porto rico to latakia was exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the dutch are so fond beside them in boxes of fragrant wood were ranged according to their size and quality puros regalias havanas and manillas and in an open cabinet a collection of german pipes of chibouques with their amber mouth pieces ornamented with coral and of narghiles with their long tubes of morocco awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the smokers monsieur_albert had himself presided at the arrangement or rather the symmetrical derangement which after coffee the guests at a breakfast of modern day love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from their mouths and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling at a quarter to ten a valet entered he composed with a little groom named john and who only spoke english all albertâ establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the countâ chasseur also this valet whose name was germain and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master held in one hand a number of paper and in the other a packet of letter which he gave to monsieur_albert albert glanced carelessly at the different missives selected two written in a small and delicate hand and enclosed in scented envelopes opened them and perused their contents with some attention how did these letter come said he one by the post madame danglarsâ footman left the other â let madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars know that i accept the place she offers me in her box
wait then during the day tell rosa that when i leave the opera i will sup with her as she wishes take her six bottles of different wineâ cyprus sherry and malaga and a barrel of ostend oysters get them at borelâ and be sure you say they are for me â at what oâ clock sir do you breakfast 20227m what time is it now â a quarter to ten â very well at half past ten m_lucien_debray will perhaps be obliged to go to the ministerâ and besidesâ monsieur_albert looked at his tablets â_it is the hour i told the count 21st may at half past ten and though i do not much rely upon his promise i wish to be punctual is the countess up yet â if you wish i will inquire â_yes ask her for one of her liqueur cellarets mine is incomplete and tell her i shall have the honor of seeing her about three oâ clock and that i request permission to introduce someone to her the valet left the room monsieur_albert threw himself on the divan tore off the cover of two or three of the paper looked at the theatre announcements made a face seeing they gave an opera and not a ballet hunted vainly amongst the advertisements for a new tooth powder of which he had heard and threw down one after the other the three leading paper of paris muttering these paper become more and more stupid every day a moment after a carriage stopped before the door and the servant announced m_lucien_debray
a tall young man with light hair clear gray eye and thin and compressed lip dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved gold buttons a white neckcloth and a tortoiseshell eye glass suspended by a silken thread and which by an effort of the superciliary and zygomatic muscles he fixed in his eye entered with a half official air without smiling or speaking good morning m_lucien_debray good morning said monsieur_albert your punctuality really alarms me what do i say punctuality you whom i expected last you arrive at five minute to ten when the time fixed was half past has the ministry resigned â no my dear fellow returned the young man seating himself on the divan reassure yourself we are tottering always but we never fall and i begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of immobility and then the affairs of the peninsula will completely consolidate us â ah true you drive don_carlos out of spain â no no my dear fellow do not confound our plans we take him to the other side of the french frontier and offer him hospitality at bourges â at bourges â_yes he has not much to complain of bourges is the capital of charles vii do you not know that all paris knew it yesterday and the day before it had already transpired on the bourse and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i do not know by what means that man contrives to obtain intelligence as soon as we do made a million â and you another order for i see you have a blue ribbon at your button hole â_yes they sent me the order of charles iii returned m_lucien_debray carelessly come do not affect indifference but confess you were pleased to have it â_oh it is very well as a finish to the toilet
it look very neat on a black coat buttoned up â and makes you resemble the prince of wales or the duke of reichstadt â_it is for that reason you see me so early â because you have the order of charles iii and you wish to announce the good news to me â no because i passed the night writing letter five and twenty despatches i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my head ached and i got up to have a ride for an hour at the bois de boulogne ennui and hunger attacked me at once two enemies who rarely accompany each other and who are yet leagued against me a sort of carlo republican alliance i then recollected you gave a breakfast this morning and here i am i am hungry feed me i am bored amuse me â_it is my duty as your host returned monsieur_albert ringing the bell while m_lucien_debray turned over with his gold mounted cane the paper that lay on the table germain a glass of sherry and a biscuit in the meantime my dear m_lucien_debray here are cigarsâ contraband of courseâ try them and persuade the minister to sell us such instead of poisoning us with cabbage leaves â peste i will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find them execrable besides that does not concern the home but the financial department address yourself to humann section of the indirect contributions corridor a no 26 â on my word said monsieur_albert you astonish me by the extent of your knowledge take a cigar â really my dear monsieur_albert replied m_lucien_debray lighting a manilla at a rose colored taper that burnt in a beautifully enamelled standâ how happy you are to have nothing to do
you do not know your own good fortune â and what would you do my dear diplomatist replied viscount_albert_de_morcerf with a slight degree of irony in his voice if you did nothing what private secretary to a minister plunged at once into european cabals and parisian intrigues having kings and better still queens to protect parties to unite elections to direct making more use of your cabinet with your pen and your telegraph than napoleon did of his battle fields with his sword and his victories possessing five and twenty thousand franc a year besides your place a horse for which baron_de_chã_teau_renaud offered you four hundred louis_xviii and which you would not part with a tailor who never disappoints you with the opera the jockey club and other diversions can you not amuse yourself well i will amuse you â how â by introducing to you a new acquaintance â a man or a woman â a man â i know so many man already â but you do not know this man â where does he come fromâ the end of the world â farther still perhaps â the deuce i hope he does not bring our breakfast with him â_oh no our breakfast comes from my fatherâ kitchen are you hungry â humiliating as such a confession is i am but i dined at de villefortâ and lawyers always give you very bad dinners you would think they felt some remorse did you ever remark that â ah depreciate other personsâ dinners you ministers give such splendid one â_yes but we do not invite people of fashion if we were not forced to entertain a parcel of country boobies because they think and vote with us we should never dream of dining at home i assure you â well take another glass of sherry and another biscuit â willingly your spanish wine is excellent
you see we were quite right to pacify that country â_yes but don_carlos â well don_carlos will drink bordeaux and in ten year we will marry his son to the little queen â you will then obtain the golden fleece if you are still in the ministry â i think monsieur_albert you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke this morning â well you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach but i hear m_beauchamp in the next room you can dispute together and that will pass away the time â about what â about the paper â my dear friend said m_lucien_debray with an air of sovereign contempt do i ever read the paper â then you will dispute the more â m_beauchamp announced the servant come in come in said monsieur_albert rising and advancing to meet the young man here is m_lucien_debray who detests you without reading you so he says â he is quite right returned m_beauchamp for i criticise him without knowing what he does good day commander â ah you know that already said the private secretary smiling and shaking hand with him pardieu â and what do they say of it in the world â in which world we have so many world in the year of grace 1838 â in the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders â they say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue â come come that is not bad said m_lucien_debray why do you not join our party my dear m_beauchamp with your talents you would make your fortune in three or four year â i only await one thing before following your advice that is a minister who will hold office for six month
my dear monsieur_albert one word for i must give poor m_lucien_debray a respite do we breakfast or dine i must go to the chamber for our life is not an idle one â you only breakfast i await two person and the instant they arrive we shall sit down to table chapter 40 the breakfast and what sort of person do you expect to breakfast said m_beauchamp a gentleman and a diplomatist â then we shall have to wait two hour for the gentleman and three for the diplomatist i shall come back to dessert keep me some strawberries coffee and cigars i shall take a cutlet on my way to the chamber â do not do anything of the sort for were the gentleman a montmorency and the diplomatist a metternich we will breakfast at eleven in the meantime follow debrayâ example and take a glass of sherry and a biscuit â be it so i will stay i must do something to distract my thoughts â you are like m_lucien_debray and yet it seems to me that when the minister is out of spirits the opposition ought to be joyous â ah you do not know with what i am threatened i shall hear this morning that mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars make a speech at the chamber of deputies and at his wifeâ this evening i shall hear the tragedy of a peer of france the devil take the constitutional government and since we had our choice as they say at least how could we choose that â i understand you must lay in a stock of hilarity â do not run down danglarsâ speeches said m_lucien_debray he votes for you for he belongs to the opposition â pardieu that is exactly the worst of all
i am waiting until you send him to speak at the luxembourg to laugh at my ease â my dear friend said monsieur_albert to m_beauchamp â_it is plain that the affairs of spain are settled for you are most desperately out of humor this morning recollect that parisian gossip has spoken of a marriage between myself and mlle mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i cannot in conscience therefore let you run down the speeches of a man who will one day say to me vicomte you know i give my daughter two millions â ah this marriage will never take place said m_beauchamp the king has made him a baron and can make him a peer but he cannot make him a gentleman and the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf is too aristocratic to consent for the paltry sum of two million franc to a mã salliance the viscount of viscount_albert_de_morcerf can only wed a marchioness â but two million franc make a nice little sum replied viscount_albert_de_morcerf â_it is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard or a railroad from the jardin des plantes to la rã pã â never mind what he says viscount_albert_de_morcerf said m_lucien_debray do you marry her you marry a money bag label it is true well but what does that matter it is better to have a blazon less and a figure more on it you have seven martlets on your arm give three to your wife and you will still have four that is one more than de guise had who so nearly became king of france and whose cousin was emperor of germany â on my word i think you are right m_lucien_debray said monsieur_albert absently to be sure besides every millionaire is as noble as a bastardâ that is he can
be â do not say that m_lucien_debray returned m_beauchamp laughing for here is baron_de_chã_teau_renaud who to cure you of your mania for paradoxes will pass the sword of renaud de montauban his ancestor through your body â he will sully it then returned m_lucien_debray for i am lowâ very low â_oh heavens cried m_beauchamp the minister quotes bã ranger what shall we come to next â de chã teau renaudâ m_maximilian_morrel said the servant announcing two fresh guests now then to breakfast said m_beauchamp for if i remember you told me you only expected two person monsieur_albert â m_maximilian_morrel muttered albertâ morrelâ who is he but before he had finished de baron_de_chã_teau_renaud a handsome young man of thirty gentleman all over that is with the figure of a guiche and the wit of a mortemart took albertâ hand my dear monsieur_albert said he let me introduce to you m_maximilian_morrel captain of spahis my friend and what is moreâ however the man speaks for himselfâ my preserver salute my hero viscount and he stepped on one side to give place to a young man of refined and dignified bearing with large and open brow piercing eye and black moustache whom our readers have already seen at marseilles under circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be forgotten a rich uniform half french half oriental set off his graceful and stalwart figure and his broad chest was decorated with the order of the legion of honor the young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness monsieur_albert said monsieur_albert with affectionate courtesy the count of baron_de_chã_teau_renaud knew how much pleasure this introduction would give me you are his friend be ours also â well said interrupted baron_de_chã_teau_renaud and pray that if you should ever be in a similar predicament he may do as much for you as he did for me
â what has he done asked monsieur_albert â_oh nothing worth speaking of said m_maximilian_morrel m de baron_de_chã_teau_renaud exaggerates â not worth speaking of cried baron_de_chã_teau_renaud life is not worth speaking of that is rather too philosophical on my word m_maximilian_morrel it is very well for you who risk your life every day but for me who only did so onceâ â we gather from all this baron that captain m_maximilian_morrel saved your life â exactly so â on what occasion asked m_beauchamp m_beauchamp my good fellow you know i am starving said m_lucien_debray do not set him off on some long story â well i do not prevent your sitting down to table replied m_beauchamp baron_de_chã_teau_renaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast â gentlemen said viscount_albert_de_morcerf â_it is only a quarter past ten and i expect someone else â ah true a diplomatist observed m_lucien_debray diplomat or not i donâ know i only know that he charged himself on my account with a mission which he terminated so entirely to my satisfaction that had i been king i should have instantly created him knight of all my order even had i been able to offer him the golden fleece and the garter â well since we are not to sit down to table said m_lucien_debray take a glass of sherry and tell us all about it â you all know that i had the fancy of going to africa â_it is a road your ancestors have traced for you said monsieur_albert gallantly â_yes but i doubt that your object was like theirsâ to rescue the holy sepulchre â you are quite right m_beauchamp observed the young aristocrat â_it was only to fight as an amateur
i cannot bear duelling ever since two seconds whom i had chosen to arrange an affair forced me to break the arm of one of my best friend one whom you all knowâ poor m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay â ah true said m_lucien_debray you did fight some time ago about what 20235m the devil take me if i remember returned baron_de_chã_teau_renaud but i recollect perfectly one thing that being unwilling to let such talents as mine sleep i wished to try upon the arabs the new pistols that had been given to me in consequence i embarked for oran and went from thence to constantine where i arrived just in time to witness the raising of the siege i retreated with the rest for eight and forty hour i endured the rain during the day and the cold during the night tolerably well but the third morning my horse died of cold poor bruteâ accustomed to be covered up and to have a stove in the stable the arabian finds himself unable to bear ten degrees of cold in arabia â thatâ why you want to purchase my english horse said m_lucien_debray you think he will bear the cold better â you are mistaken for i have made a vow never to return to africa â you were very much frightened then asked m_beauchamp well yes and i had good reason to be so replied baron_de_chã_teau_renaud i was retreating on foot for my horse was dead six arabs came up full gallop to cut off my head
i shot two with my double barrelled gun and two more with my pistols but i was then disarmed and two were still left one seized me by the hair that is why i now wear it so short for no one knows what may happen the other swung a yataghan and i already felt the cold steel on my neck when this gentleman whom you see here charged them shot the one who held me by the hair and cleft the skull of the other with his sabre he had assigned himself the task of saving a manâ life that day chance caused that man to be myself when i am rich i will order a statue of chance from klagmann or marochetti â_yes said m_maximilian_morrel smiling â_it was the 5th of september the anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved therefore as far as it lies in my power i endeavor to celebrate it by someâ â 20237m heroic action interrupted baron_de_chã_teau_renaud i was chosen but that is not allâ after rescuing me from the sword he rescued me from the cold not by sharing his cloak with me like st martin but by giving me the whole then from hunger by sharing with meâ guess what â a strasbourg pie asked m_beauchamp no his horse of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty appetite it was very hard â the horse said viscount_albert_de_morcerf laughing
â no the sacrifice returned baron_de_chã_teau_renaud ask m_lucien_debray if he would sacrifice his english steed for a stranger â not for a stranger said m_lucien_debray but for a friend i might perhaps â i divined that you would become mine count replied m_maximilian_morrel besides as i had the honor to tell you heroism or not sacrifice or not that day i owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good fortune had on other day granted to us â the history to which m_maximilian_morrel alludes continued baron_de_chã_teau_renaud is an admirable one which he will tell you some day when you are better acquainted with him today let us fill our stomachs and not our memories what time do you breakfast monsieur_albert â at half past ten â precisely asked m_lucien_debray taking out his watch â_oh you will give me five minutesâ grace replied viscount_albert_de_morcerf for i also expect a preserver â of whom â of myself cried viscount_albert_de_morcerf parbleu do you think i cannot be saved as well as anyone else and that there are only arabs who cut off head our breakfast is a philanthropic one and we shall have at tableâ at least i hope soâ two benefactors of humanity â what shall we do said m_lucien_debray we have only one monthyon prize â well it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it said m_beauchamp that is the way the academy mostly escapes from the dilemma â and where does he come from asked m_lucien_debray
â you have already answered the question once but so vaguely that i venture to put it a second time â really said monsieur_albert i do not know when i invited him three month ago he was then at rome but since that time who knows where he may have gone â and you think him capable of being exact demanded m_lucien_debray i think him capable of everything â well with the five minutesâ grace we have only ten left â i will profit by them to tell you something about my guest â i beg pardon interrupted m_beauchamp are there any materials for an article in what you are going to tell us â_yes and for a most curious one â go on then for i see i shall not get to the chamber this morning and i must make up for it â i was at rome during the last carnival â we know that said m_beauchamp â_yes but what you do not know is that i was carried off by bandits â there are no bandits cried m_lucien_debray â_yes there are and most hideous or rather most admirable one for i found them ugly enough to frighten me â come my dear monsieur_albert said m_lucien_debray confess that your cook is behindhand that the oysters have not arrived from ostend or marennes and that like madame de maintenon you are going to replace the dish by a story say so at once we are sufficiently well bred to excuse you and to listen to your history fabulous as it promises to be â and i say to you fabulous as it may seem i tell it as a true one from beginning to end
the brigands had carried me off and conducted me to a gloomy spot called the catacombs of saint sebastian â i know it said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud i narrowly escaped catching a fever there â and i did more than that replied viscount_albert_de_morcerf for i caught one i was informed that i was prisoner until i paid the sum of 000 roman crownsâ about 24 000 franc unfortunately i had not above 500 i was at the end of my journey and of my credit i wrote to franzâ and were he here he would confirm every wordâ i wrote then to m_franz_de_quesnel that if he did not come with the four thousand crowns before six at ten minute past i should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in whose company i had the honor of being and signor luigi_vampa such was the name of the chief of these bandits would have scrupulously kept his word â but m_franz_de_quesnel did come with the four thousand crowns said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud a man whose name is m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay or monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring them â no he arrived accompanied simply by the guest i am going to present to you â ah this gentleman is a hercules killing cacus a perseus freeing andromeda â no he is a man about my own size â armed to the teeth â he had not even a knitting needle â but he paid your ransom â he said two word to the chief and i was free â and they apologized to him for having carried you off said m_beauchamp just so â why he is a second ariosto â no his name is the count_of_monte_cristo â there is no count of monte cristoâ said m_lucien_debray
â i do not think so added baron_de_chã_teau_renaud with the air of a man who knows the whole of the european nobility perfectly does anyone know anything of a count_of_monte_cristo â he comes possibly from the holy land and one of his ancestors possessed calvary as the mortemarts did the dead sea â i think i can assist your researches said m_maximilian_morrel count_of_monte_cristo is a little island i have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my father employedâ a grain of sand in the centre of the mediterranean an atom in the infinite â precisely cried monsieur_albert well he of whom i speak is the lord and master of this grain of sand of this atom he has purchased the title of count somewhere in tuscany â he is rich then â i believe so â but that ought to be visible â that is what deceives you m_lucien_debray â i do not understand you â have you read the arabian night â what a question â well do you know if the person you see there are rich or poor if their sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds they seem like poor fishermen and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with the wealth of the indies â which means â which means that my count_of_monte_cristo is one of those fishermen he has even a name taken from the book since he calls himself sinbad the sailor and has a cave filled with gold â and you have seen this cavern viscount_albert_de_morcerf asked m_beauchamp no but m_franz_de_quesnel has for heavenâ sake not a word of this before him m_franz_de_quesnel went in with his eye blindfolded and was waited on by mutes and by woman to whom cleopatra was a painted strumpet
only he is not quite sure about the woman for they did not come in until after he had taken hashish so that what he took for woman might have been simply a row of statues the two young man looked at viscount_albert_de_morcerf as if to say â are you mad or are you laughing at us â and i also said m_maximilian_morrel thoughtfully have heard something like this from an old sailor named penelon â ah cried monsieur_albert â_it is very lucky that m_maximilian_morrel comes to aid me you are vexed are you not that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth â my dear monsieur_albert said m_lucien_debray what you tell us is so extraordinary â ah because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of themâ they have no time they are too much taken up with interfering in the affairs of their countrymen who travel â now you get angry and attack our poor agents how will you have them protect you the chamber cuts down their salaries every day so that now they have scarcely any will you be ambassador monsieur_albert i will send you to constantinople â no lest on the first demonstration i make in favor of mehemet ali_pasha_of_yanina the sultan send me the bowstring and make my secretaries strangle me â you say very true responded m_lucien_debray â_yes said monsieur_albert but this has nothing to do with the existence of the count_of_monte_cristo â pardieu everyone exists â doubtless but not in the same way everyone has not black slaves a princely retinue an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an arabian fortress horse that cost six thousand franc apiece and greek mistresses â have you seen the greek mistress â i have both seen and heard her
i saw her at the theatre and heard her one morning when i breakfasted with the count â he eats then â_yes but so little it can hardly be called eating â he must be a vampire â laugh if you will the countess gâ who knew lord_ruthven declared that the count was a vampire â ah capital said m_beauchamp for a man not connected with newspapers here is the pendant to the famous sea serpent of the constitutionnel â wild eye the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure said m_lucien_debray facial angle strongly developed magnificent forehead livid complexion black beard sharp and white teeth politeness unexceptionable â just so m_lucien_debray returned viscount_albert_de_morcerf you have described him feature for feature yes keen and cutting politeness this man has often made me shudder and one day when we were viewing an execution i thought i should faint more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he spoke of every description of torture than from the sight of the executioner and the culprit â did he not conduct you to the ruins of the colosseum and suck your blood asked m_beauchamp or having delivered you make you sign a flaming parchment surrendering your soul to him as esau did his birth right â rail on rail on at your ease gentlemen said viscount_albert_de_morcerf somewhat piqued when i look at you parisians idlers on the boulevard de gand or the bois de boulogne and think of this man it seems to me we are not of the same race â i am highly flattered returned m_beauchamp at the same time added baron_de_chã_teau_renaud your count_of_monte_cristo is a very fine fellow always excepting his little arrangements with the italian banditti â there are no italian banditti said m_lucien_debray no vampire cried m_beauchamp no
count of monte cristoâ added m_lucien_debray there is half past ten striking monsieur_albert 20243m confess you have dreamed this and let us sit down to breakfast continued m_beauchamp but the sound of the clock had not died away when germain announced his excellency the count_of_monte_cristo the involuntary start everyone gave proved how much morcerfâ narrative had impressed them and monsieur_albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden emotion he had not heard a carriage stop in the street or step in the antechamber the door had itself opened noiselessly the count appeared dressed with the greatest simplicity but the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in his toilet every article of dressâ hat coat gloves and bootsâ was from the first makers he seemed scarcely five and thirty but what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait m_lucien_debray had drawn the count advanced smiling into the centre of the room and approached monsieur_albert who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial manner punctuality said count_of_monte_cristo is the politeness of kings according to one of your sovereigns i think but it is not the same with travellers however i hope you will excuse the two or three seconds i am behindhand five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble and especially in france where it seems it is forbidden to beat the postilions â my dear count replied monsieur_albert i was announcing your visit to some of my friend whom i had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make and whom i now present to you
they are the count of baron_de_chã_teau_renaud whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers and whose ancestors had a place at the round table m_lucien_debray private secretary to the minister of the interior m_beauchamp an editor of a paper and the terror of the french government but of whom in spite of his national celebrity you perhaps have not heard in italy since his paper is prohibited there and m_maximilian_morrel captain of spahis at this name the count who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy but at the same time with coldness and formality stepped a pace forward and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks you wear the uniform of the new french conquerors monsieur_albert said he â_it is a handsome uniform no one could have said what caused the countâ voice to vibrate so deeply and what made his eye flash which was in general so clear lustrous and limpid when he pleased you have never seen our africans count said monsieur_albert never replied the count who was by this time perfectly master of himself again well beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest heart in the whole army â_oh de viscount_albert_de_morcerf interrupted m_maximilian_morrel let me go on captain and we have just heard continued monsieur_albert of a new deed of his and so heroic a one that although i have seen him today for the first time i request you to allow me to introduce him as my friend at these word it was still possible to observe in count_of_monte_cristo the concentrated look changing color and slight trembling of the eyelid that show emotion ah you have a noble heart said the count so much the better
this exclamation which corresponded to the countâ own thought rather than to what monsieur_albert was saying surprised everybody and especially m_maximilian_morrel who looked at count_of_monte_cristo with wonder but at the same time the intonation was so soft that however strange the speech might seem it was impossible to be offended at it 20245 â why should he doubt it said m_beauchamp to baron_de_chã_teau_renaud in reality replied the latter who with his aristocratic glance and his knowledge of the world had penetrated at once all that was penetrable in count_of_monte_cristo monsieur_albert has not deceived us for the count is a most singular being what say you m_maximilian_morrel â ma foi he has an open look about him that pleases me in spite of the singular remark he has made about me â gentlemen said monsieur_albert germain informs me that breakfast is ready my dear count allow me to show you the way they passed silently into the breakfast room and everyone took his place gentlemen said the count seating himself permit me to make a confession which must form my excuse for any improprieties i may commit i am a stranger and a stranger to such a degree that this is the first time i have ever been at paris the french way of living is utterly unknown to me and up to the present time i have followed the eastern customs which are entirely in contrast to the parisian i beg you therefore to excuse if you find anything in me too turkish too italian or too arabian now then let us breakfast â with what an air he says all this muttered m_beauchamp decidedly he is a great man â a great man in his own country added m_lucien_debray a great man in every country m_lucien_debray said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud
the count was it may be remembered a most temperate guest monsieur_albert remarked this expressing his fears lest at the outset the parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point my dear count said he i fear one thing and that is that the fare of the rue du helder is not so much to your taste as that of the piazza di spagna i ought to have consulted you on the point and have had some dishes prepared expressly â did you know me better returned the count smiling you would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself who has successively lived on macaroni at naples polenta at milan olla podrida at valencia pilau at constantinople curry in india and swallowsâ nests in china i eat everywhere and of everything only i eat but little and today that you reproach me with my want of appetite is my day of appetite for i have not eaten since yesterday morning â what cried all the guests you have not eaten for four and twenty hour â no replied the count i was forced to go out of my road to obtain some information near nã mes so that i was somewhat late and therefore i did not choose to stop â and you ate in your carriage asked viscount_albert_de_morcerf no i slept as i generally do when i am weary without having the courage to amuse myself or when i am hungry without feeling inclined to eat â but you can sleep when you please monsieur_albert said m_maximilian_morrel â_yes â you have a recipe for it â an
infallible one â that would be invaluable to us in africa who have not always any food to eat and rarely anything to drink â_yes said count_of_monte_cristo but unfortunately a recipe excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army which might not awake when it was needed â may we inquire what is this recipe asked m_lucien_debray â_oh yes returned count_of_monte_cristo i make no secret of it it is a mixture of excellent opium which i fetched myself from canton in order to have it pure and the best hashish which grows in the eastâ that is between the tigris and the euphrates these two ingredients are mixed in equal proportions and formed into pills ten minute after one is taken the effect is produced ask baron m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay i think he tasted them one day â_yes replied viscount_albert_de_morcerf he said something about it to me â but said m_beauchamp who as became a journalist was very incredulous you always carry this drug about you â always â would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills continued m_beauchamp hoping to take him at a disadvantage no monsieur_albert returned the count and he drew from his pocket a marvellous casket formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored pellet about the size of a pea this ball had an acrid and penetrating odor there were four or five more in the emerald which would contain about a dozen the casket passed around the table but it was more to examine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from hand to hand and is it your cook who prepares these pills asked m_beauchamp
â oh no monsieur_albert replied count_of_monte_cristo i do not thus betray my enjoyments to the vulgar i am a tolerable chemist and prepare my pills myself â this is a magnificent emerald and the largest i have ever seen said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud although my mother has some remarkable family jewels â i had three similar one returned count_of_monte_cristo i gave one to the sultan who mounted it in his sabre another to our holy father the pope who had it set in his tiara opposite to one nearly as large though not so fine given by the emperor napoleon to his predecessor pius vii i kept the third for myself and i had it hollowed out which reduced its value but rendered it more commodious for the purpose i intended everyone looked at count_of_monte_cristo with astonishment he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth or that he was mad however the sight of the emerald made them naturally incline to the former belief and what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents asked m_lucien_debray the sultan the liberty of a woman replied the count the pope the life of a man so that once in my life i have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the step of a throne â and it was peppino you saved was it not cried viscount_albert_de_morcerf â_it was for him that you obtained pardon â perhaps returned the count smiling my dear count you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus said viscount_albert_de_morcerf
â i had announced you beforehand to my friend as an enchanter of the arabian night a wizard of the middle ages but the parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they mistake for caprices of the imagination the most incontestable truths when these truths do not form a part of their daily existence for example here is m_lucien_debray who reads and m_beauchamp who prints every day a member of the jockey club has been stopped and robbed on the boulevard â four person have been assassinated in the rue st denisâ or the faubourg st germain â ten fifteen or twenty thieves have been arrested in a cafã on the boulevard du temple or in the thermes de julien â and yet these same man deny the existence of the bandits in the maremma the campagna di romana or the pontine marshes tell them yourself that i was taken by bandits and that without your generous intercession i should now have been sleeping in the catacombs of st sebastian instead of receiving them in my humble abode in the rue du helder â ah said count_of_monte_cristo you promised me never to mention that circumstance â_it was not i who made that promise cried viscount_albert_de_morcerf â_it must have been someone else whom you have rescued in the same manner and whom you have forgotten pray speak of it for i shall not only i trust relate the little i do know but also a great deal i do not know â_it seems to me returned the count smiling that you played a sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what happened 20249m well you promise me if i tell all i know to relate in your turn all that i do not know â that is but fair replied count_of_monte_cristo
â well said viscount_albert_de_morcerf for three day i believed myself the object of the attentions of a masque whom i took for a descendant of tullia or poppã a while i was simply the object of the attentions of a contadina and i say contadina to avoid saying peasant girl what i know is that like a fool a greater fool than he of whom i spoke just now i mistook for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen with a beardless chin and slim waist and who just as i was about to imprint a chaste salute on his lip placed a pistol to my head and aided by seven or eight others led or rather dragged me to the catacombs of st sebastian where i found a highly educated brigand chief perusing cã sarâ commentaries and who deigned to leave off reading to inform me that unless the next morning before six oâ clock four thousand piastres were paid into his account at his bankerâ at a quarter past six i should have ceased to exist the letter is still to be seen for it is in m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinayâ possession signed by me and with a postscript of luigi_vampa this is all i know but i know not count how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of rome who ordinarily have so little respect for anything i assure you m_franz_de_quesnel and i were lost in admiration â nothing more simple returned the count i had known the famous luigi_vampa for more than ten year
when he was quite a child and only a shepherd i gave him a few gold pieces for showing me my way and he in order to repay me gave me a poniard the hilt of which he had carved with his own hand and which you may have seen in my collection of arm in after year whether he had forgotten this interchange of presents which ought to have cemented our friendship or whether he did not recollect me he sought to take me but on the contrary it was i who captured him and a dozen of his band i might have handed him over to roman justice which is somewhat expeditious and which would have been particularly so with him but i did nothing of the sortâ i suffered him and his band to depart â with the condition that they should sin no more said m_beauchamp laughing i see they kept their promise â no monsieur_albert returned count_of_monte_cristo upon the simple condition that they should respect myself and my friend perhaps what i am about to say may seem strange to you who are socialists and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor but i never seek to protect a society which does not protect me and which i will even say generally occupies itself about me only to injure me and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem and preserving a neutrality towards them it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me â bravo cried baron_de_chã_teau_renaud you are the first man i ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism bravo count bravo â_it is frank at least said m_maximilian_morrel but
i am sure that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly avowed â how have i deviated from those principles monsieur_albert asked count_of_monte_cristo who could not help looking at m_maximilian_morrel with so much intensity that two or three time the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing glance why it seems to me replied m_maximilian_morrel that in delivering de viscount_albert_de_morcerf whom you did not know you did good to your neighbor and to society â of which he is the brightest ornament said m_beauchamp drinking off a glass of champagne my dear count cried viscount_albert_de_morcerf you are at faultâ you one of the most formidable logicians i knowâ and you must see it clearly proved that instead of being an egotist you are a philanthropist ah you call yourself oriental a levantine maltese indian chinese your family name is count_of_monte_cristo sinbad the sailor is your baptismal appellation and yet the first day you set foot in paris you instinctively display the greatest virtue or rather the chief defect of us eccentric parisians that is you assume the vices you have not and conceal the virtues you possess â my dear vicomte returned count_of_monte_cristo i do not see in all i have done anything that merits either from you or these gentlemen the pretended eulogies i have received you were no stranger to me for i knew you from the time i gave up two room to you invited you to breakfast with me lent you one of my carriage witnessed the carnival in your company and saw with you from a window in the piazza del popolo the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted
i will appeal to any of these gentlemen could i leave my guest in the hand of a hideous bandit as you term him besides you know i had the idea that you could introduce me into some of the paris salons when i came to france you might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project but today you see it was a reality and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word â i will keep it returned viscount_albert_de_morcerf but i fear that you will be much disappointed accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic horizons amongst us you will not meet with any of those episodes with which your adventurous existence has so familiarized you our chimborazo is mortmartre our himalaya is mount valã rien our great desert is the plain of grenelle where they are now boring an artesian well to water the caravans we have plenty of thieves though not so many as is said but these thieves stand in far more dread of a policeman than a lord france is so prosaic and paris so civilized a city that you will not find in its eighty five departmentsâ i say eighty five because i do not include corsicaâ you will not find then in these eighty five departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph or a grotto in which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp there is but one service i can render you and for that i place myself entirely at your order that is to present or make my friend present you everywhere besides you have no need of anyone to introduce youâ with your name and your fortune and your talentâ count_of_monte_cristo bowed with a somewhat ironical smile
â you can present yourself everywhere and be well received i can be useful in one way onlyâ if knowledge of parisian habits of the means of rendering yourself comfortable or of the bazaars can assist you may depend upon me to find you a fitting dwelling here i do not dare offer to share my apartments with you as i shared yours at romeâ i who do not profess egotism but am yet egotist par excellence for except myself these room would not hold a shadow more unless that shadow were feminine â ah said the count that is a most conjugal reservation i recollect that at rome you said something of a projected marriage may i congratulate you â the affair is still in projection â and he who says in projection means already decided said m_lucien_debray no replied viscount_albert_de_morcerf my father is most anxious about it and i hope ere long to introduce you if not to my wife at least to my betrothedâ mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars said count_of_monte_cristo tell me is not her father baron mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â_yes returned viscount_albert_de_morcerf a baron of a new creation â what matter said count_of_monte_cristo if he has rendered the state services which merit this distinction â enormous one answered m_beauchamp
â although in reality a liberal he negotiated a loan of six millions for charles in 1829 who made him a baron and chevalier of the legion of honor so that he wears the ribbon not as you would think in his waistcoat pocket but at his button hole â ah interrupted viscount_albert_de_morcerf laughing m_beauchamp beauchamp keep that for the corsaire or the charivari but spare my future father in law before me then turning to count_of_monte_cristo you just now spoke his name as if you knew the baron â i do not know him returned count_of_monte_cristo but i shall probably soon make his acquaintance for i have a credit opened with him by the house_of_peers of richard blount of london arstein eskeles of vienna and thomson_french_of_rome at rome as he pronounced the two last name the count glanced at m_maximilian_morrel if the stranger expected to produce an effect on m_maximilian_morrel he was not mistakenâ m_maximilian_morrel started as if he had been electrified thomson_french_of_rome said he do you know this house_of_peers monsieur_albert 20253m they are my bankers in the capital of the christian world returned the count quietly can my influence with them be of any service to you â_oh count you could assist me perhaps in researches which have been up to the present fruitless this house_of_peers in past year did ours a great service and has i know not for what reason always denied having rendered us this service â i shall be at your order said count_of_monte_cristo bowing but continued viscount_albert_de_morcerf ã propos of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars we have strangely wandered from the subject we were speaking of a suitable habitation for the count_of_monte_cristo come gentlemen let us all propose some place
where shall we lodge this new guest in our great capital â faubourg saint germain said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud the count will find there a charming hotel with a court and garden â bah baron_de_chã_teau_renaud returned m_lucien_debray you only know your dull and gloomy faubourg saint germain do not pay any attention to him countâ live in the chaussã dâ antin thatâ the real centre of paris â boulevard de lâ opã ra said m_beauchamp the second floorâ a house_of_peers with a balcony the count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought there and as he smokes his chibouque see all paris pass before him â you have no idea then m_maximilian_morrel asked baron_de_chã_teau_renaud you do not propose anything â_oh yes returned the young man smiling on the contrary i have one but i expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant proposals made him yet as he has not replied to any of them i will venture to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming hotel in the pompadour style that my sister has inhabited for a year in the rue meslay â you have a sister asked the count â_yes monsieur_albert a most excellent sister â married â nearly nine year â happy asked the count again as happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be replied m_maximilian_morrel she married the man she loved who remained faithful to us in our fallen fortunesâ m_emmanuel herbaut count_of_monte_cristo smiled imperceptibly i live there during my leave of absence continued m_maximilian_morrel and i shall be together with my brother in law m_emmanuel at the disposition of the count whenever he thinks fit to honor us â one minute cried monsieur_albert without giving count_of_monte_cristo the time to reply take care you are going to immure a traveller sinbad the sailor a man who comes to see paris
you are going to make a patriarch of him 20255m â_oh no said m_maximilian_morrel my sister is five and twenty my brother in law is thirty they are gay young and happy besides the count will be in his own house_of_peers and only see them when he thinks fit to do so â thanks monsieur_albert said count_of_monte_cristo i shall content myself with being presented to your sister and her husband if you will do me the honor to introduce me but i cannot accept the offer of anyone of these gentlemen since my habitation is already prepared â what cried viscount_albert_de_morcerf you are then going to a hotelâ that will be very dull for you â was i so badly lodged at rome said count_of_monte_cristo smiling parbleu at rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your apartments but i presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar sum every day â_it is not that which deterred me replied count_of_monte_cristo but as i determined to have a house_of_peers to myself i sent on my valet de chambre and he ought by this time to have bought the house_of_peers and furnished it â but you have then a valet de chambre who knows paris said m_beauchamp â_it is the first time he has ever been in paris he is black and cannot speak returned count_of_monte_cristo â_it is ali_pasha_of_yanina cried monsieur_albert in the midst of the general surprise â_yes ali_pasha_of_yanina himself my nubian mute whom you saw i think at rome â certainly said viscount_albert_de_morcerf i recollect him perfectly but how could you charge a nubian to purchase a house_of_peers and a mute to furnish it he will do everything wrong â undeceive yourself monsieur_albert replied count_of_monte_cristo i am quite sure that on the contrary he will choose everything as i wish
he knows my tastes my caprices my wants he has been here a week with the instinct of a hound hunting by himself he will arrange everything for me he knew that i should arrive today at ten oâ clock he was waiting for me at nine at the barriã re de fontainebleau he gave me this paper it contains the number of my new abode read it yourself and count_of_monte_cristo passed a paper to monsieur_albert ah that is really original said m_beauchamp and very princely added baron_de_chã_teau_renaud what do you not know your house_of_peers asked m_lucien_debray no said count_of_monte_cristo i told you i did not wish to be behind my time i dressed myself in the carriage and descended at the viscountâ door the young man looked at each other they did not know if it was a comedy count_of_monte_cristo was playing but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity that it was impossible to suppose what he said was falseâ besides why should he tell a falsehood we must content ourselves then said m_beauchamp with rendering the count all the little services in our power i in my quality of journalist open all the theatres to him â thanks monsieur_albert returned count_of_monte_cristo my steward has order to take a box at each theatre â is your steward also a nubian asked m_lucien_debray no he is a countryman of yours if a corsican is a countryman of anyoneâ but you know him de viscount_albert_de_morcerf â is it that excellent monsieur_bertuccio who understands hiring window so well â_yes you saw him the day i had the honor of receiving you he has been a soldier a smugglerâ in fact everything
i would not be quite sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some trifleâ a stab with a knife for instance â and you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward said m_lucien_debray of how much does he rob you every year â on my word replied the count not more than another i am sure he answers my purpose knows no impossibility and so i keep him â then continued baron_de_chã_teau_renaud since you have an establishment a steward and a hotel in the champs lysã es you only want a mistress monsieur_albert smiled he thought of the fair greek he had seen in the countâ box at the argentina and valle theatres i have something better than that said count_of_monte_cristo i have a slave you procure your mistresses from the opera the vaudeville or the variã tã i purchased mine at constantinople it cost me more but i have nothing to fear â but you forget replied m_lucien_debray laughing that we are franks by name and franks by nature as king charles said and that the moment she puts her foot in france your slave becomes free â who will tell her â the first person who sees her â she only speaks romaic â that is different â but at least we shall see her said m_beauchamp or do you keep eunuchs as well as mutes â_oh no replied count_of_monte_cristo i do not carry brutalism so far everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me and when they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else it is for that reason perhaps that they do not quit me they had long since passed to dessert and cigars my dear monsieur_albert said m_lucien_debray rising â_it is half past two
your guest is charming but you leave the best company to go into the worst sometimes i must return to the ministerâ i will tell him of the count and we shall soon know who he is â take care returned monsieur_albert no one has been able to accomplish that â_oh we have three millions for our police it is true they are almost always spent beforehand but no matter we shall still have fifty thousand franc to spend for this purpose â and when you know will you tell me â i promise you au revoir monsieur_albert gentlemen good morning as he left the room m_lucien_debray called out loudly my carriage â bravo said m_beauchamp to monsieur_albert i shall not go to the chamber but i have something better to offer my readers than a speech of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â for heavenâ sake m_beauchamp returned viscount_albert_de_morcerf do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him everywhere is he not peculiar â he is more than that replied baron_de_chã_teau_renaud he is one of the most extraordinary man i ever saw in my life are you coming m_maximilian_morrel â directly i have given my card to the count who has promised to pay us a visit at rue meslay no 14 â be sure i shall not fail to do so returned the count bowing and m_maximilian_morrel left the room with the baron_de_chã_teau_renaud leaving count_of_monte_cristo alone with viscount_albert_de_morcerf chapter 41 the presentation when monsieur_albert found himself alone with count_of_monte_cristo my dear count said he allow me to commence my services as cicerone by showing you a specimen of a bachelorâ apartment
you who are accustomed to the palaces of italy can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square foot a young man who is not the worst lodged in paris can live as we pass from one room to another i will open the window to let you breathe count_of_monte_cristo had already seen the breakfast room and the salon on the ground floor monsieur_albert led him first to his atelier which was as we have said his favorite apartment count_of_monte_cristo quickly appreciated all that monsieur_albert had collected hereâ old cabinets japanese porcelain oriental stuffs venetian glass arm from all part of the worldâ everything was familiar to him and at the first glance he recognized their date their country and their origin viscount_albert_de_morcerf had expected he should be the guide on the contrary it was he who under the countâ guidance followed a course of archã ology mineralogy and natural history they descended to the first floor monsieur_albert led his guest into the salon
the salon was filled with the works of modern artists there were landscapes by duprã with their long reeds and tall trees their lowing oxen and marvellous skies delacroixâ arabian cavaliers with their long white burnouses their shining belts their damasked arm their horse who tore each other with their teeth while their riders contended fiercely with their maces aquarelles of boulanger representing notre dame de paris with that vigor that makes the artist the rival of the poet there were paintings by diaz who makes his flowers more beautiful than flowers his suns more brilliant than the sun designs by decamp as vividly colored as those of salvator rosa but more poetic pastels by giraud and mã¼ller representing child like angels and woman with the features of a virgin sketches torn from the album of dauzatsâ travels in the east that had been made in a few seconds on the saddle of a camel or beneath the dome of a mosqueâ in a word all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the art lost and gone with ages long since past monsieur_albert expected to have something new this time to show to the traveller but to his great surprise the latter without seeking for the signatures many of which indeed were only initials named instantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy to see that each name was not only known to him but that each style associated with it had been appreciated and studied by him from the salon they passed into the bedchamber it was a model of taste and simple elegance a single portrait signed by lã opold robert shone in its carved and gilded frame
this portrait attracted the count of monte cristoâ attention for he made three rapid step in the chamber and stopped suddenly before it it was the portrait of a young woman of five or six and twenty with a dark complexion and light and lustrous eye veiled beneath long lashes she wore the picturesque costume of the catalan fisherwomen a red and black bodice and golden pins in her hair she was looking at the sea and her form was outlined on the blue ocean and sky the light was so faint in the room that monsieur_albert did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over the countâ visage or the nervous heaving of his chest and shoulders silence prevailed for an instant during which count_of_monte_cristo gazed intently on the picture you have there a most charming mistress viscount said the count in a perfectly calm tone and this costumeâ a ball costume doubtlessâ becomes her admirably â ah monsieur_albert returned monsieur_albert i would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this you do not know my mother she it is whom you see here she had her portrait painted thus six or eight year ago this costume is a fancy one it appears and the resemblance is so great that i think i still see my mother the same as she was in 1830 the countess had this portrait painted during the countâ absence she doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise but strange to say this portrait seemed to displease my father and the value of the picture which is as you see one of the best works of lã opold robert could not overcome his dislike to it
it is true between ourselves that de viscount_albert_de_morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the luxembourg a general renowned for theory but a most mediocre amateur of art it is different with my mother who paints exceedingly well and who unwilling to part with so valuable a picture gave it to me to put here where it would be less likely to displease de viscount_albert_de_morcerf whose portrait by gros i will also show you excuse my talking of family matters but as i shall have the honor of introducing you to the count i tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture the picture seems to have a malign influence for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it and still more rarely does she look at it without weeping this disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess who are still as much united although married more than twenty year as on the first day of their wedding 20261m count_of_monte_cristo glanced rapidly at monsieur_albert as if to seek a hidden meaning in his word but it was evident the young man uttered them in the simplicity of his heart now said monsieur_albert that you have seen all my treasures allow me to offer them to you unworthy as they are consider yourself as in your own house_of_peers and to put yourself still more at your ease pray accompany me to the apartments of de viscount_albert_de_morcerf he whom i wrote from rome an account of the services you rendered me and to whom i announced your promised visit and i may say that both the count and countess anxiously desire to thank you in person you are somewhat blasã
i know and family scenes have not much effect on sinbad the sailor who has seen so many others however accept what i propose to you as an initiation into parisian lifeâ a life of politeness visiting and introductions count_of_monte_cristo bowed without making any answer he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret as one of those conventions of society which every gentleman look upon as a duty monsieur_albert summoned his servant and ordered him to acquaint and madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf of the arrival of the count_of_monte_cristo monsieur_albert followed him with the count when they arrived at the antechamber above the door was visible a shield which by its rich ornaments and its harmony with the rest of the furniture indicated the importance the owner attached to this blazon count_of_monte_cristo stopped and examined it attentively azure seven merlets or placed bender said he these are doubtless your family arm except the knowledge of blazons that enables me to decipher them i am very ignorant of heraldryâ i a count of a fresh creation fabricated in tuscany by the aid of a commandery of st stephen and who would not have taken the trouble had i not been told that when you travel much it is necessary besides you must have something on the panels of your carriage to escape being searched by the custom house_of_peers officers excuse my putting such a question to you â_it is not indiscreet returned viscount_albert_de_morcerf with the simplicity of conviction you have guessed rightly these are our arm that is those of my father but they are as you see joined to another shield which has gules a silver tower which are my motherâ
by her side i am spanish but the family of viscount_albert_de_morcerf is french and i have heard one of the oldest of the south of france â_yes replied count_of_monte_cristo these blazons prove that almost all the armed pilgrims that went to the holy land took for their arm either a cross in honor of their mission or birds of passage in sign of the long voyage they were about to undertake and which they hoped to accomplish on the wings of faith one of your ancestors had joined the crusades and supposing it to be only that of st louis_xviii that makes you mount to the thirteenth century which is tolerably ancient â_it is possible said viscount_albert_de_morcerf my father has in his study a genealogical tree which will tell you all that and on which i made commentaries that would have greatly edified dâ hozier and jaucourt at present i no longer think of it and yet i must tell you that we are beginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these thing under our popular government â well then your government would do well to choose from the past something better than the thing that i have noticed on your monuments and which have no heraldic meaning whatever as for you viscount continued count_of_monte_cristo to viscount_albert_de_morcerf you are more fortunate than the government for your arm are really beautiful and speak to the imagination yes you are at once from provence and spain that explains if the portrait you showed me be like the dark hue i so much admired on the visage of the noble catalan â_it would have required the penetration of dipus or the sphinx to have divined the irony the count concealed beneath these word apparently uttered with the greatest politeness
morcerf thanked him with a smile and pushed open the door above which were his arm and which as we have said opened into the salon in the most conspicuous part of the salon was another portrait it was that of a man from five to eight and thirty in the uniform of a general officer wearing the double epaulet of heavy bullion that indicates superior rank the ribbon of the legion of honor around his neck which showed he was a commander and on the right breast the star of a grand officer of the order of the saviour and on the left that of the grand cross of charles iii which proved that the person represented by the picture had served in the wars of greece and spain or what was just the same thing as regarded decorations had fulfilled some diplomatic mission in the two countries count_of_monte_cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care than he had bestowed upon the other when another door opened and he found himself opposite to the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf in person he was a man of forty to forty five year but he seemed at least fifty and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair which was cut short in the military fashion he was dressed in plain clothes and wore at his button hole the ribbons of the different order to which he belonged he entered with a tolerably dignified step and some little haste count_of_monte_cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step
it seemed as if his foot were rooted to the ground and his eye on the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf father said the young man i have the honor of presenting to you the count_of_monte_cristo the generous friend whom i had the good fortune to meet in the critical situation of which i have told you â you are most welcome monsieur_albert said the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf saluting count_of_monte_cristo with a smile and monsieur_albert has rendered our house_of_peers in preserving its only heir a service which insures him our eternal gratitude as he said these word the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf pointed to a chair while he seated himself in another opposite the window count_of_monte_cristo in taking the seat viscount_albert_de_morcerf offered him placed himself in such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet curtains and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a whole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted there the countess said viscount_albert_de_morcerf was at her toilet when she was informed of the visit she was about to receive she will however be in the salon in ten minute â_it is a great honor to me returned count_of_monte_cristo to be thus on the first day of my arrival in paris brought in contact with a man whose merit equals his reputation and to whom fortune has for once been equitable but has she not still on the plains of mitidja or in the mountains of atlas a marshalâ staff to offer you â_oh replied viscount_albert_de_morcerf reddening slightly i have left the service monsieur_albert made a peer at the restoration i served through the first campaign under the order of marshal bourmont
i could therefore expect a higher rank and who knows what might have happened had the elder branch remained on the throne but the revolution of july was it seems sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful and it was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period i tendered my resignation for when you have gained your epaulets on the battle field you do not know how to manå uvre on the slippery grounds of the salons i have hung up my sword and cast myself into politics i have devoted myself to industry i study the useful arts during the twenty year i served i often wished to do so but i had not the time â these are the idea that render your nation superior to any other returned count_of_monte_cristo a gentleman of high birth possessor of an ample fortune you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure soldier step by stepâ this is uncommon then become general peer of france commander of the legion of honor you consent to again commence a second apprenticeship without any other hope or any other desire than that of one day becoming useful to your fellow creatures this indeed is praiseworthy nay more it is sublime 20265m monsieur_albert looked on and listened with astonishment he was not used to see count_of_monte_cristo give vent to such bursts of enthusiasm
â alas continued the stranger doubtless to dispel the slight cloud that covered morcerfâ brow we do not act thus in italy we grow according to our race and our species and we pursue the same lines and often the same uselessness all our life â but monsieur_albert said the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf for a man of your merit italy is not a country and france opens her arm to receive you respond to her call france will not perhaps be always ungrateful she treats her child ill but she always welcomes strangers â ah father said monsieur_albert with a smile â_it is evident you do not know the count_of_monte_cristo he despises all honor and contents himself with those written on his passport â that is the most just remark replied the stranger i ever heard made concerning myself â you have been free to choose your career observed the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf with a sigh and you have chosen the path strewed with flowers â precisely monsieur_albert replied count_of_monte_cristo with one of those smile that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze if i did not fear to fatigue you said the general evidently charmed with the countâ manner i would have taken you to the chamber there is a debate very curious to those who are strangers to our modern senators â i shall be most grateful monsieur_albert if you will at some future time renew your offer but i have been flattered with the hope of being introduced to the countess and i will therefore wait â ah here is my mother cried the viscount
monte cristo turned round hastily and saw madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf at the entrance of the salon at the door opposite to that by which her husband had entered pale and motionless when count_of_monte_cristo turned round she let fall her arm which for some unknown reason had been resting on the gilded door post she had been there some moment and had heard the last word of the visitor the latter rose and bowed to the countess who inclined herself without speaking ah good heavens madame said the count are you ill or is it the heat of the room that affects you â are you ill mother cried the viscount springing towards her she thanked them both with a smile no returned she but i feel some emotion on seeing for the first time the man without whose intervention we should have been in tears and desolation monsieur_albert continued the countess advancing with the majesty of a queen i owe to you the life of my son and for this i bless you now i thank you for the pleasure you give me in thus affording me the opportunity of thanking you as i have blessed you from the bottom of my heart the count bowed again but lower than before he was even paler than mercã_dã_s madame said he the count and yourself recompense too generously a simple action to save a man to spare a fatherâ feelings or a motherâ sensibility is not to do a good action but a simple deed of humanity at these word uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and politeness madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf replied â_it is very fortunate for my son monsieur_albert that he found such a friend and i thank god that thing are thus
and mercã_dã_s raised her fine eye to heaven with so fervent an expression of gratitude that the count fancied he saw tears in them de viscount_albert_de_morcerf approached her madame said he i have already made my excuses to the count for quitting him and i pray you to do so also the sitting commences at two it is now three and i am to speak â go then and monsieur_albert and i will strive our best to forget your absence replied the countess with the same tone of deep feeling monsieur_albert continued she turning to count_of_monte_cristo will you do us the honor of passing the rest of the day with us â believe me madame i feel most grateful for your kindness but i got out of my travelling carriage at your door this morning and i am ignorant how i am installed in paris which i scarcely know this is but a trifling inquietude i know but one that may be appreciated â we shall have the pleasure another time said the countess you promise that count_of_monte_cristo inclined himself without answering but the gesture might pass for assent i will not detain you monsieur_albert continued the countess i would not have our gratitude become indiscreet or importunate â my dear count said monsieur_albert i will endeavor to return your politeness at rome and place my coupã at your disposal until your own be ready â a thousand thanks for your kindness viscount returned the count_of_monte_cristo but
i suppose that monsieur_bertuccio has suitably employed the four hour and a half i have given him and that i shall find a carriage of some sort ready at the door monsieur_albert was used to the countâ manner of proceeding he knew that like nero he was in search of the impossible and nothing astonished him but wishing to judge with his own eye how far the countâ order had been executed he accompanied him to the door of the house_of_peers count_of_monte_cristo was not deceived as soon as he appeared in the count of morcerfâ antechamber a footman the same who at rome had brought the countâ card to the two young man and announced his visit sprang into the vestibule and when he arrived at the door the illustrious traveller found his carriage awaiting him it was a coupã of kollerâ building and with horse and harness for which drake had to the knowledge of all the lions of paris refused on the previous day seven hundred guineas monsieur_albert said the count to monsieur_albert i do not ask you to accompany me to my house_of_peers as i can only show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry and i have as you know a reputation to keep up as regards not being taken by surprise give me therefore one more day before i invite you i shall then be certain not to fail in my hospitality â if you ask me for a day count i know what to anticipate it will not be a house_of_peers i shall see but a palace
you have decidedly some genius at your control â ma foi spread that idea replied the count_of_monte_cristo putting his foot on the velvet lined step of his splendid carriage and that will be worth something to me among the ladies as he spoke he sprang into the vehicle the door was closed but not so rapidly that count_of_monte_cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf when monsieur_albert returned to his mother he found her in the boudoir reclining in a large velvet armchair the whole room so obscure that only the shining spangle fastened here and there to the drapery and the angles of the gilded frames of the pictures showed with some degree of brightness in the gloom monsieur_albert could not see the face of the countess as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head and which fell over her features in misty folds but it seemed to him as though her voice had altered he could distinguish amid the perfumes of the roses and heliotropes in the flower stands the sharp and fragrant odor of volatile salts and he noticed in one of the chased cups on the mantle piece the countessâ smelling bottle taken from its shagreen case and exclaimed in a tone of uneasiness as he entered my dear mother have you been ill during my absence â no no monsieur_albert but you know these roses tuberoses and orange flowers throw out at first before one is used to them such violent perfumes â then my dear mother said monsieur_albert putting his hand to the bell they must be taken into the antechamber
you are really ill and just now were so pale as you came into the roomâ â was i pale monsieur_albert â_yes a pallor that suits you admirably mother but which did not the less alarm my father and myself â did your father speak of it inquired mercã_dã_s eagerly no madame but do you not remember that he spoke of the fact to you 20269m â_yes i do remember replied the countess a servant entered summoned by albertâ ring of the bell take these flowers into the anteroom or dressing room said the viscount they make the countess ill the footman obeyed his order a long pause ensued which lasted until all the flowers were removed what is this name of count_of_monte_cristo inquired the countess when the servant had taken away the last vase of flowers is it a family name or the name of the estate or a simple title â i believe mother it is merely a title the count purchased an island in the tuscan archipelago and as he told you today has founded a commandery you know the same thing was done for saint stephen of florence saint george constantinian of parma and even for the order of malta except this he has no pretension to nobility and calls himself a chance count although the general opinion at rome is that the count is a man of very high distinction â his manner are admirable said the countess at least as far as i could judge in the few minute he remained here â they are perfect mother so perfect that they surpass by far all i have known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities of europeâ the english the spanish and the german the countess paused a moment then after a slight hesitation she resumed
â you have seen my dear albertâ i ask the question as a motherâ you have seen de count_of_monte_cristo in his house_of_peers you are quicksighted have much knowledge of the world more tact than is usual at your age do you think the count is really what he appears to be â what does he appear to be â why you have just said a man of high distinction â i told you my dear mother he was esteemed such â but what is your own opinion monsieur_albert â i must tell you that i have not come to any decided opinion respecting him but i think him a maltese â i do not ask you of his origin but what he is â ah what he is that is quite another thing i have seen so many remarkable thing in him that if you would have me really say what i think i shall reply that i really do look upon him as one of byronâ heroes whom misery has marked with a fatal brand some manfred some lara some werner one of those wrecks as it were of some ancient family who disinherited of their patrimony have achieved one by the force of their adventurous genius which has placed them above the laws of society â you sayâ â i say that count_of_monte_cristo is an island in the midst of the mediterranean without inhabitants or garrison the resort of smugglers of all nations and pirates of every flag who knows whether or not these industrious worthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues for his protection â that is possible said the countess reflecting
â never mind continued the young man smuggler or not you must agree mother dear as you have seen him that the count_of_monte_cristo is a remarkable man who will have the greatest success in the salons of paris why this very morning in my room he made his entrã amongst us by striking every man of us with amazement not even excepting baron_de_chã_teau_renaud â and what do you suppose is the countâ age inquired mercã_dã_s evidently attaching great importance to this question thirty five or thirty six mother â so young â_it is impossible said mercã_dã_s replying at the same time to what monsieur_albert said as well as to her own private reflection â_it is the truth however three or four time he has said to me and certainly without the slightest premeditation at such a period i was five year old at another ten year old at another twelve and i induced by curiosity which kept me alive to these details have compared the dates and never found him inaccurate the age of this singular man who is of no age is then i am certain thirty five besides mother remark how vivid his eye how raven black his hair and his brow though so pale is free from wrinkles he is not only vigorous but also young the countess bent her head as if beneath a heavy wave of bitter thoughts and has this man displayed a friendship for you monsieur_albert she asked with a nervous shudder i am inclined to think so â andâ doâ youâ likeâ him â why he pleases me in spite of m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay who tries to convince me that he is a being returned from the other world the countess shuddered monsieur_albert she said in a voice which was altered by emotion i have always put you on your guard against new acquaintances
now you are a man and are able to give me advice yet i repeat to you monsieur_albert be prudent â why my dear mother it is necessary in order to make your advice turn to account that i should know beforehand what i have to distrust the count never plays he only drinks pure water tinged with a little sherry and is so rich that he cannot without intending to laugh at me try to borrow money what then have i to fear from him â you are right said the countess and my fears are weakness especially when directed against a man who has saved your life how did your father receive him monsieur_albert it is necessary that we should be more than complaisant to the count de viscount_albert_de_morcerf is sometimes occupied his business makes him reflective and he might without intending itâ â nothing could be in better taste than my fatherâ demeanor madame said monsieur_albert nay more he seemed greatly flattered at two or three compliments which the count very skilfully and agreeably paid him with as much ease as if he had known him these thirty year each of these little tickling arrows must have pleased my father added monsieur_albert with a laugh and thus they parted the best possible friend and de viscount_albert_de_morcerf even wished to take him to the chamber to hear the speakers the countess made no reply she fell into so deep a reverie that her eye gradually closed the young man standing up before her gazed upon her with that filial affection which is so tender and endearing with child whose mother are still young and handsome
then after seeing her eye closed and hearing her breathe gently he believed she had dropped asleep and left the apartment on tiptoe closing the door after him with the utmost precaution this devil of a fellow he muttered shaking his head i said at the time he would create a sensation here and i measure his effect by an infallible thermometer my mother has noticed him and he must therefore perforce be remarkable he went down to the stables not without some slight annoyance when he remembered that the count_of_monte_cristo had laid his hand on a turnoutâ which sent his bays down to second place in the opinion of connoisseurs most decidedly said he man are not equal and i must beg my father to develop this theorem in the chamber of peers chapter 42 monsieur_albert monsieur_bertuccio meanwhile the count had arrived at his house_of_peers it had taken him six minute to perform the distance but these six minute were sufficient to induce twenty young man who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase themselves to put their horse in a gallop in order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give 20 000 franc apiece for his horse the house_of_peers ali_pasha_of_yanina had chosen and which was to serve as a town residence to count_of_monte_cristo was situated on the right hand as you ascend the champs lysã es a thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in the centre and masked a portion of the front around this shrubbery two alleys like two arm extended right and left and formed a carriage drive from the iron gates to a double portico on every step of which stood a porcelain vase filled with flowers
this house_of_peers isolated from the rest had besides the main entrance another in the rue de ponthieu even before the coachman had hailed the concierge the massy gates rolled on their hingesâ they had seen the count coming and at paris as everywhere else he was served with the rapidity of lightning the coachman entered and traversed the half circle without slackening his speed and the gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound on the gravel the carriage stopped at the left side of the portico two man presented themselves at the carriage window the one was ali_pasha_of_yanina who smiling with an expression of the most sincere joy seemed amply repaid by a mere look from count_of_monte_cristo the other bowed respectfully and offered his arm to assist the count in descending thanks monsieur_bertuccio said the count springing lightly up the three step of the portico and the notary â he is in the small salon excellency returned monsieur_bertuccio and the cards i ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the number of the house_of_peers â your excellency it is done already i have been myself to the best engraver of the palais royal who did the plate in my presence the first card struck off was taken according to your order to the baron mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars rue de la chaussã dâ antin no the others are on the mantle piece of your excellencyâ bedroom â good what oâ clock is it â four oâ clock count_of_monte_cristo gave his hat cane and gloves to the same french footman who had called his carriage at the count of morcerfâ and then he passed into the small salon preceded by monsieur_bertuccio who showed him the way these are but indifferent marbles in this antechamber said count_of_monte_cristo
â i trust all this will soon be taken away monsieur_bertuccio bowed as the steward had said the notary awaited him in the small salon he was a simple looking lawyerâ clerk elevated to the extraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener you are the notary empowered to sell the country house_of_peers that i wish to purchase monsieur_albert asked count_of_monte_cristo â_yes count returned the notary is the deed of sale ready â_yes count â have you brought it â here it is â very well and where is this house_of_peers that i purchase asked the count carelessly addressing himself half to monsieur_bertuccio half to the notary the steward made a gesture that signified i do not know the notary looked at the count with astonishment what said he does not the count know where the house_of_peers he purchases is situated â no returned the count the count does not know â how should i know i have arrived from cadiz this morning i have never before been at paris and it is the first time i have ever even set my foot in france â ah that is different the house_of_peers you purchase is at auteuil at these word monsieur_bertuccio turned pale and where is auteuil asked the count close by here monsieur_albert replied the notaryâ a little beyond passy a charming situation in the heart of the bois de boulogne â so near as that said the count but that is not in the country what made you choose a house_of_peers at the gates of paris monsieur_bertuccio â i cried the steward with a strange expression his excellency did not charge me to purchase this house_of_peers if his excellency will recollectâ if he will thinkâ â ah true observed count_of_monte_cristo i recollect now
i read the advertisement in one of the paper and was tempted by the false title a country house_of_peers â â_it is not yet too late cried monsieur_bertuccio eagerly and if your excellency will intrust me with the commission i will find you a better at enghien at fontenay aux roses or at bellevue â_oh no returned count_of_monte_cristo negligently since i have this i will keep it â and you are quite right said the notary who feared to lose his fee â_it is a charming place well supplied with spring water and fine trees a comfortable habitation although abandoned for a long time without reckoning the furniture which although old is yet valuable now that old thing are so much sought after i suppose the count has the tastes of the day â to be sure returned count_of_monte_cristo â_it is very convenient then â_it is moreâ it is magnificent â peste let us not lose such an opportunity returned count_of_monte_cristo the deed if you please mr notary and he signed it rapidly after having first run his eye over that part of the deed in which were specified the situation of the house_of_peers and the name of the proprietors monsieur_bertuccio said he give fifty five thousand franc to monsieur_albert the steward left the room with a faltering step and returned with a bundle of bank notes which the notary counted like a man who never gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all there
â and now demanded the count are all the forms complied with â all sir â have you the keys â they are in the hand of the concierge who takes care of the house_of_peers but here is the order i have given him to install the count in his new possessions â very well and count_of_monte_cristo made a sign with his hand to the notary which said i have no further need of you you may go â but observed the honest notary the count is i think mistaken it is only fifty thousand franc everything included â and your fee â is included in this sum â but have you not come from auteuil here â_yes certainly â well then it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of time and trouble said the count and he made a gesture of polite dismissal the notary left the room backwards and bowing down to the ground it was the first time he had ever met a similar client see this gentleman out said the count to monsieur_bertuccio and the steward followed the notary out of the room scarcely was the count alone when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck and which never left him after having sought for a few minute he stopped at a leaf which had several notes and compared them with the deed of sale which lay on the table and recalling his souvenirs â auteuil rue de la fontaine no 28 â_it is indeed the same said he and now am i to rely upon an avowal extorted by religious or physical terror however in an hour i shall know all
bertuccio cried he striking a light hammer with a pliant handle on a small gong monsieur_bertuccio the steward appeared at the door monsieur_albert monsieur_bertuccio said the count did you never tell me that you had travelled in france â in some part of franceâ yes excellency â you know the environs of paris then â no excellency no returned the steward with a sort of nervous trembling which count_of_monte_cristo a connoisseur in all emotions rightly attributed to great disquietude â_it is unfortunate returned he that you have never visited the environs for i wish to see my new property this evening and had you gone with me you could have given me some useful information â to auteuil cried monsieur_bertuccio whose copper complexion became lividâ i go to auteuil â well what is there surprising in that when i live at auteuil you must come there as you belong to my service monsieur_bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master and remained motionless without making any answer why what has happened to you are you going to make me ring a second time for the carriage asked count_of_monte_cristo in the same tone that louis_xviii xiv pronounced the famous i have been almost obliged to wait monsieur_bertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber and cried in a hoarse voice his excellencyâ horse count_of_monte_cristo wrote two or three notes and as he sealed the last the steward appeared your excellencyâ carriage is at the door said he well take your hat and gloves returned count_of_monte_cristo am i to accompany you your excellency cried monsieur_bertuccio certainly you must give the order for i intend residing at the house_of_peers 20277m
it was unexampled for a servant of the countâ to dare to dispute an order of his so the steward without saying a word followed his master who got into the carriage and signed to him to follow which he did taking his place respectfully on the front seat chapter 43 the house_of_peers at auteuil count_of_monte_cristo noticed as they descended the staircase that monsieur_bertuccio signed himself in the corsican manner that is had formed the sign of the cross in the air with his thumb and as he seated himself in the carriage muttered a short prayer anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the stewardâ extraordinary repugnance for the countâ projected drive without the wall but the count was too curious to let monsieur_bertuccio off from this little journey in twenty minute they were at auteuil the stewardâ emotion had continued to augment as they entered the village monsieur_bertuccio crouched in the corner of the carriage began to examine with a feverish anxiety every house_of_peers they passed tell them to stop at rue de la fontaine no 28 said the count fixing his eye on the steward to whom he gave this order bertuccioâ forehead was covered with perspiration however he obeyed and leaning out of the window he cried to the coachman â rue de la fontaine no 28 no 28 was situated at the extremity of the village during the drive night had set in and darkness gave the surroundings the artificial appearance of a scene on the stage the carriage stopped the footman sprang off the box and opened the door well said the count you do not get out bertuccioâ you are going to stay in the carriage then what are you thinking of
this evening monsieur_bertuccio sprang out and offered his shoulder to the count who this time leaned upon it as he descended the three step of the carriage knock said the count and announce me monsieur_bertuccio knocked the door opened and the concierge appeared what is it asked he â_it is your new master my good fellow said the footman and he held out to the concierge the notaryâ order the house_of_peers is sold then demanded the concierge and this gentleman is coming to live here â_yes my friend returned the count and i will endeavor to give you no cause to regret your old master â_oh monsieur_albert said the concierge i shall not have much cause to regret him for he came here but seldom it is five year since he was here last and he did well to sell the house_of_peers for it did not bring him in anything at all â what was the name of your old master said count_of_monte_cristo the marquis of madame_de_saint_mã_ran ah i am sure he has not sold the house_of_peers for what he gave for it â the marquis of madame_de_saint_mã_ran returned the count the name is not unknown to me the marquis of madame_de_saint_mã_ran and he appeared to meditate an old gentleman continued the concierge a staunch follower of the bourbons he had an only daughter who married m_noirtier_de_villefort who had been the kingâ attorney at nã mes and afterwards at versailles count_of_monte_cristo glanced at monsieur_bertuccio who became whiter than the wall against which he leaned to prevent himself from falling and is not this daughter dead demanded count_of_monte_cristo i fancy
i have heard so â_yes monsieur_albert one and twenty year ago and since then we have not seen the poor marquis three time â thanks thanks said count_of_monte_cristo judging from the stewardâ utter prostration that he could not stretch the cord further without danger of breaking it give me a light â shall i accompany you monsieur_albert â no it is unnecessary monsieur_bertuccio will show me a light and count_of_monte_cristo accompanied these word by the gift of two gold pieces which produced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the concierge ah monsieur_albert said he after having vainly searched on the mantle piece and the shelves i have not got any candles â take one of the carriage lamps monsieur_bertuccio said the count and show me the apartments the steward obeyed in silence but it was easy to see from the manner in which the hand that held the light trembled how much it cost him to obey they went over a tolerably large ground floor a first floor consisted of a salon a bathroom and two bedrooms near one of the bedrooms they came to a winding staircase that led down to the garden ah here is a private staircase said the count that is convenient light me monsieur_bertuccio and go first we will see where it leads to â monsieur_albert replied monsieur_bertuccio â_it leads to the garden â and pray how do you know that â_it ought to do so at least â well let us be sure of that monsieur_bertuccio sighed and went on first the stairs did indeed lead to the garden at the outer door the steward paused go on monsieur_albert monsieur_bertuccio said the count
but he who was addressed stood there stupefied bewildered stunned his haggard eye glanced around as if in search of the traces of some terrible event and with his clenched hand he seemed striving to shut out horrible recollections well insisted the count no no cried monsieur_bertuccio setting down the lantern at the angle of the interior wall no monsieur_albert it is impossible i can go no farther â what does this mean demanded the irresistible voice of count_of_monte_cristo why you must see your excellency cried the steward that this is not natural that having a house_of_peers to purchase you purchase it exactly at auteuil and that purchasing it at auteuil this house_of_peers should be no 28 rue de la fontaine oh why did i not tell you all i am sure you would not have forced me to come i hoped your house_of_peers would have been some other one than this as if there was not another house_of_peers at auteuil than that of the assassination â what what cried count_of_monte_cristo stopping suddenly what word do you utter devil of a man corsican that you areâ always mysteries or superstitions come take the lantern and let us visit the garden you are not afraid of ghosts with me i hope monsieur_bertuccio raised the lantern and obeyed the door as it opened disclosed a gloomy sky in which the moon strove vainly to struggle through a sea of clouds that covered her with billows of vapor which she illumined for an instant only to sink into obscurity the steward wished to turn to the left no no monsieur_albert said count_of_monte_cristo what is the use of following the alleys
here is a beautiful lawn let us go on straight forwards monsieur_bertuccio wiped the perspiration from his brow but obeyed however he continued to take the left hand count_of_monte_cristo on the contrary took the right hand arrived near a clump of trees he stopped the steward could not restrain himself move monsieurâ move away i entreat you you are exactly in the spot â what spot â where he fell 20281m my dear monsieur_albert monsieur_bertuccio said count_of_monte_cristo laughing control yourself we are not at sartã ne or at corte this is not a corsican maquis but an english garden badly kept i own but still you must not calumniate it for that â monsieur_albert i implore you do not stay there â i think you are going mad monsieur_bertuccio said the count coldly if that is the case i warn you i shall have you put in a lunatic asylum â alas excellency returned monsieur_bertuccio joining his hand and shaking his head in a manner that would have excited the countâ laughter had not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him and rendered him attentive to the least revelation of this timorous conscience alas excellency the evil has arrived â monsieur_bertuccio said the count i am very glad to tell you that while you gesticulate you wring your hand and roll your eye like a man possessed by a devil who will not leave him and i have always observed that the devil most obstinate to be expelled is a secret i knew you were a corsican i knew you were gloomy and always brooding over some old history of the vendetta and i overlooked that in italy because in italy those thing are thought nothing of
but in france they are considered in very bad taste there are gendarmes who occupy themselves with such affairs judges who condemn and scaffolds which avenge monsieur_bertuccio clasped his hand and as in all these evolutions he did not let fall the lantern the light showed his pale and altered countenance count_of_monte_cristo examined him with the same look that at rome he had bent upon the execution of m_andrea_cavalcanti and then in a tone that made a shudder pass through the veins of the poor stewardâ the abbã_busoni then told me an untruth said he when after his journey in france in 1829 he sent you to me with a letter of recommendation in which he enumerated all your valuable qualities well i shall write to the abbã i shall hold him responsible for his protã gã s misconduct and i shall soon know all about this assassination only i warn you that when i reside in a country i conform to all its code and i have no wish to put myself within the compass of the french laws for your sake â_oh do not do that excellency i have always served you faithfully cried monsieur_bertuccio in despair i have always been an honest man and as far as lay in my power i have done good â i do not deny it returned the count but why are you thus agitated
it is a bad sign a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in the cheeks and such fever in the hand of a man â but your excellency replied monsieur_bertuccio hesitatingly did not the abbã_busoni who heard my confession in the prison at nã mes tell you that i had a heavy burden upon my conscience â_yes but as he said you would make an excellent steward i concluded you had stolenâ that was all â_oh your excellency returned monsieur_bertuccio in deep contempt or as you are a corsican that you had been unable to resist the desire of making a stiff as you call it â_yes my good master cried monsieur_bertuccio casting himself at the countâ foot â_it was simply vengeanceâ nothing else â i understand that but i do not understand what it is that galvanizes you in this manner â but monsieur_albert it is very natural returned monsieur_bertuccio since it was in this house_of_peers that my vengeance was accomplished â what my house_of_peers â_oh your excellency it was not yours then â whose then the marquis de madame_de_saint_mã_ran i think the concierge said what had you to revenge on the marquis de madame_de_saint_mã_ran â_oh it was not on him monsieur_albert it was on another â this is strange returned count_of_monte_cristo seeming to yield to his reflections that you should find yourself without any preparation in a house_of_peers where the event happened that causes you so much remorse â monsieur_albert said the steward â_it is fatality i am sure first you purchase a house_of_peers at auteuilâ this house_of_peers is the one where i have committed an assassination you descend to the garden by the same staircase by which he descended you stop at the spot where he received the blow and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried his child
this is not chance for chance in this case is too much like providence â well amiable corsican let us suppose it is providence i always suppose anything people please and besides you must concede something to diseased mind come collect yourself and tell me all â i have related it but once and that was to the abbã_busoni such thing continued monsieur_bertuccio shaking his head are only related under the seal of confession â then said the count i refer you to your confessor turn chartreux or trappist and relate your secrets but as for me i do not like anyone who is alarmed by such phantasms and i do not choose that my servant should be afraid to walk in the garden of an evening i confess i am not very desirous of a visit from the commissary of police for in italy justice is only paid when silentâ in france she is paid only when she speaks peste i thought you somewhat corsican a great deal smuggler and an excellent steward but i see you have other strings to your bow you are no longer in my service monsieur_albert monsieur_bertuccio â_oh your excellency your excellency cried the steward struck with terror at this threat if that is the only reason i cannot remain in your service i will tell all for if i quit you it will only be to go to the scaffold â that is different replied count_of_monte_cristo but if you intend to tell an untruth reflect it were better not to speak at all â no monsieur_albert i swear to you by my hopes of salvation i will tell you all for the abbã_busoni himself only knew a part of my secret but i pray you go away from that plane tree
the moon is just bursting through the clouds and there standing where you do and wrapped in that cloak that conceals your figure you remind me of m_noirtier_de_villefort â what cried count_of_monte_cristo â_it was m_noirtier_de_villefort â your excellency knows him â the former royal attorney at nã mes â_yes â who married the marquis of saint mã ranâ daughter â_yes â who enjoyed the reputation of being the most severe the most upright the most rigid magistrate on the bench â well monsieur_albert said monsieur_bertuccio this man with this spotless reputationâ â well â was a villain â bah replied count_of_monte_cristo impossible â_it is as i tell you â ah really said count_of_monte_cristo have you proof of this â i had it â and you have lost it how stupid â_yes but by careful search it might be recovered â really returned the count relate it to me for it begins to interest me and the count humming an air from lucia went to sit down on a bench while monsieur_bertuccio followed him collecting his thoughts monsieur_bertuccio remained standing before him 20285m chapter 44 the vendetta at what point shall i begin my story your excellency asked monsieur_bertuccio where you please returned count_of_monte_cristo since i know nothing at all of it â i thought the abbã_busoni had told your excellency â some particulars doubtless but that is seven or eight year ago and i have forgotten them â then i can speak without fear of tiring your excellency â go on monsieur_bertuccio you will supply the want of the evening paper â the story begins in 1815 â ah said count_of_monte_cristo 1815 is not yesterday â no monsieur_albert and yet i recollect all thing as clearly as if they had happened but then
i had a brother an elder brother who was in the service of the emperor he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed entirely of corsicans this brother was my only friend we became orphansâ i at five he at eighteen he brought me up as if i had been his son and in 1814 he married when the emperor returned from the island of elba my brother instantly joined the army was slightly wounded at waterloo and retired with the army beyond the loire â but that is the history of the hundred day monsieur_bertuccio said the count unless i am mistaken it has been already written â excuse me excellency but these details are necessary and you promised to be patient â go on i will keep my word â one day we received a letter i should tell you that we lived in the little village of rogliano at the extremity of cap corse this letter was from my brother he told us that the army was disbanded and that he should return by chã teauroux clermont ferrand le puy and nã mes and if i had any money he prayed me to leave it for him at nã mes with an innkeeper with whom i had dealings â in the smuggling line said count_of_monte_cristo eh your excellency everyone must live â certainly go on â i loved my brother tenderly as i told your excellency and i resolved not to send the money but to take it to him myself i possessed a thousand franc i left five hundred with assunta my sister in law and with the other five hundred i set off for nã mes it was easy to do so and as i had my boat and a lading to take in at sea everything favored my project
but after we had taken in our cargo the wind became contrary so that we were four or five day without being able to enter the rhã ne at last however we succeeded and worked up to arles i left the boat between bellegarde and beaucaire and took the road to nã mes â we are getting to the story now â_yes your excellency excuse me but as you will see i only tell you what is absolutely necessary just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of france three brigands called trestaillon truphemy and graffan publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected of bonapartism you have doubtless heard of these massacres your excellency â vaguely i was far from france at that period go on â as i entered nã mes i literally waded in blood at every step you encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers who killed plundered and burned at the sight of this slaughter and devastation i became terrified not for myselfâ for i a simple corsican fisherman had nothing to fear on the contrary that time was most favorable for us smugglersâ but for my brother a soldier of the empire returning from the army of the loire with his uniform and his epaulets there was everything to apprehend i hastened to the innkeeper my misgivings had been but too true my brother had arrived the previous evening at nã mes and at the very door of the house_of_peers where he was about to demand hospitality he had been assassinated i did all in my power to discover the murderers but no one durst tell me their name so much were they dreaded i then thought of that french justice of which i had heard so much and which feared nothing and i went to the kingâ attorney â and
this kingâ attorney was named m_noirtier_de_villefort asked count_of_monte_cristo carelessly â_yes your excellency he came from marseilles where he had been deputy procureur his zeal had procured him advancement and he was said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the island of elba â then said count_of_monte_cristo you went to him â monsieur_albert i said my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of nã mes i know not by whom but it is your duty to find out you are the representative of justice here and it is for justice to avenge those she has been unable to protect â who was your brother asked he â a lieutenant in the corsican battalion â a soldier of the usurper then â a soldier of the french army â well replied he he has smitten with the sword and he has perished by the sword â you are mistaken monsieur_albert i replied he has perished by the poniard â what do you want me to do asked the magistrate â i have already told youâ avenge him â on whom â on his murderers â how should i know who they are â order them to be sought for â why your brother has been involved in a quarrel and killed in a duel all these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor but which are not suffered now for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct â monsieur_albert i replied â_it is not for myself that i entreat your interferenceâ i should grieve for him or avenge him but my poor brother had a wife and were anything to happen to me the poor creature would perish from want for my brotherâ pay alone kept her
pray try and obtain a small government pension for her â every revolution has its catastrophes returned m_noirtier_de_villefort your brother has been the victim of this it is a misfortune and government owes nothing to his family if we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they were in power your brother would be today in all probability condemned to death what has happened is quite natural and in conformity with the law of reprisals â what cried i do you a magistrate speak thus to me â all these corsicans are mad on my honor replied m_noirtier_de_villefort they fancy that their countryman is still emperor you have mistaken the time you should have told me this two month ago it is too late now go now at once or i shall have you put out â i looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from further entreaty but he was a man of stone i approached him and said in a low voice well since you know the corsicans so well you know that they always keep their word you think that it was a good deed to kill my brother who was a bonapartist because you are a royalist well i who am a bonapartist also declare one thing to you which is that i will kill you from this moment i declare the vendetta against you so protect yourself as well as you can for the next time we meet your last hour has come
and before he had recovered from his surprise i opened the door and left the room â well well said count_of_monte_cristo such an innocent looking person as you are to do those thing monsieur_bertuccio and to a kingâ attorney at that but did he know what was meant by the terrible word vendettaâ â he knew so well that from that moment he shut himself in his house_of_peers and never went out unattended seeking me high and low fortunately i was so well concealed that he could not find me then he became alarmed and dared not stay any longer at nã mes so he solicited a change of residence and as he was in reality very influential he was nominated to versailles but as you know a corsican who has sworn to avenge himself cares not for distance so his carriage fast as it went was never above half a dayâ journey before me who followed him on foot the most important thing was not to kill him onlyâ for i had an opportunity of doing so a hundred timesâ but to kill him without being discoveredâ at least without being arrested i no longer belonged to myself for i had my sister in law to protect and provide for for three month i watched m_noirtier_de_villefort for three month he took not a step out of door without my following him at length i discovered that he went mysteriously to auteuil
i followed him thither and i saw him enter the house_of_peers where we now are only instead of entering by the great door that look into the street he came on horseback or in his carriage left the one or the other at the little inn and entered by the gate you see there count_of_monte_cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in the darkness the door to which monsieur_bertuccio alluded as i had nothing more to do at versailles i went to auteuil and gained all the information i could if i wished to surprise him it was evident this was the spot to lie in wait for him the house_of_peers belonged as the concierge informed your excellency to de madame_de_saint_mã_ran villefortâ father in law de madame_de_saint_mã_ran lived at marseilles so that this country house_of_peers was useless to him and it was reported to be let to a young widow known only by the name of the baroness â one evening as i was looking over the wall i saw a young and handsome woman who was walking alone in that garden which was not overlooked by any window and i guessed that she was awaiting m_noirtier_de_villefort when she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her features i saw she was from eighteen to nineteen tall and very fair as she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure i saw she would ere long become a mother a few moment after the little door was opened and a man entered the young woman hastened to meet him they threw themselves into each otherâ arm embraced tenderly and returned together to the house_of_peers
the man was m_noirtier_de_villefort i fully believed that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the whole of the garden alone 20291m and asked the count did you ever know the name of this woman â no excellency returned monsieur_bertuccio you will see that i had no time to learn it â go on â that evening continued monsieur_bertuccio i could have killed the procureur but as i was not sufficiently acquainted with the neighborhood i was fearful of not killing him on the spot and that if his cries were overheard i might be taken so i put it off until the next occasion and in order that nothing should escape me i took a chamber looking into the street bordered by the wall of the garden three day after about seven oâ clock in the evening i saw a servant on horseback leave the house_of_peers at full gallop and take the road to sã vres i concluded that he was going to versailles and i was not deceived three hour later the man returned covered with dust his errand was performed and two minute after another man on foot muffled in a mantle opened the little door of the garden which he closed after him i descended rapidly although i had not seen villefortâ face i recognized him by the beating of my heart i crossed the street and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the wall and by means of which i had once before looked into the garden this time i did not content myself with looking but i took my knife out of my pocket felt that the point was sharp and sprang over the wall
my first care was to run to the door he had left the key in it taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the lock nothing then preventing my escape by this means i examined the grounds the garden was long and narrow a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy foliage that made a background for the shrubs and flowers in order to go from the door to the house_of_peers or from the house_of_peers to the door m_noirtier_de_villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees 20293m â_it was the end of september the wind blew violently the faint glimpses of the pale moon hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds that were sweeping across the sky whitened the gravel walks that led to the house_of_peers but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick shrubberies in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of discovery i hid myself in the one nearest to the path m_noirtier_de_villefort must take and scarcely was i there when amidst the gusts of wind i fancied i heard groans but you know or rather you do not know your excellency that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that he hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears two hour passed thus during which i imagined i heard moans repeatedly midnight struck as the last stroke died away i saw a faint light shine through the window of the private staircase by which we have just descended the door opened and the man in the mantle reappeared
â the terrible moment had come but i had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the least i drew my knife from my pocket again opened it and made ready to strike the man in the mantle advanced towards me but as he drew near i saw that he had a weapon in his hand i was afraid not of a struggle but of a failure when he was only a few paces from me i saw that what i had taken for a weapon was only a spade i was still unable to divine for what reason m_noirtier_de_villefort had this spade in his hand when he stopped close to the thicket where i was glanced round and began to dig a hole in the earth i then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle which he laid on the grass in order to dig more freely then i confess curiosity mingled with hatred i wished to see what m_noirtier_de_villefort was going to do there and i remained motionless holding my breath then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when i saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box two foot long and six or eight inches deep i let him place the box in the hole he had made then while he stamped with his foot to remove all traces of his occupation i rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast exclaiming â i am giovanni monsieur_bertuccio thy death for my brotherâ thy treasure for his widow thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than i had hoped â i know not if he heard these word i think he did not for he fell without a cry
i felt his blood gush over my face but i was intoxicated i was delirious and the blood refreshed instead of burning me in a second i had disinterred the box then that it might not be known i had done so i filled up the hole threw the spade over the wall and rushed through the door which i double locked carrying off the key â ah said count_of_monte_cristo â_it seems to me this was nothing but murder and robbery â no your excellency returned monsieur_bertuccio â_it was a vendetta followed by restitution â and was the sum a large one â_it was not money â ah i recollect replied the count did you not say something of an infant â_yes excellency i hastened to the river sat down on the bank and with my knife forced open the lock of the box in a fine linen cloth was wrapped a new born child its purple visage and its violet colored hand showed that it had perished from suffocation but as it was not yet cold i hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my foot after a moment i fancied that i felt a slight pulsation of the heart and as i had been assistant at the hospital at bastia i did what a doctor would have doneâ i inflated the lungs by blowing air into them and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it began to breathe and cried feebly in my turn i uttered a cry but a cry of joy â god has not cursed me then i cried since he permits me to save the life of a human creature in exchange for the life i have taken away â 20295m and what did you do with the child asked count_of_monte_cristo
â it was an embarrassing load for a man seeking to escape â i had not for a moment the idea of keeping it but i knew that at paris there was an asylum where they receive such creatures as i passed the city gates i declared that i had found the child on the road and i inquired where the asylum was the box confirmed my statement the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents the blood with which i was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from anyone else no objection was raised but they pointed out the asylum which was situated at the upper end of the rue dâ enfer and after having taken the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces so that one of the two letter which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the child while the other remained in my possession i rang the bell and fled with all speed a fortnight after i was at rogliano and i said to assunta â console thyself sister israel is dead but he is avenged â she demanded what i meant and when i had told her all â giovanni said she you should have brought this child with you we would have replaced the parents it has lost have called it m_benedetto and then in consequence of this good action god would have blessed us in reply i gave her the half of the linen i had kept in order to reclaim him if we became rich â what letter were marked on the linen said count_of_monte_cristo an and an surmounted by a baronâ coronet â by heaven monsieur_bertuccio you make use of heraldic terms where did you study heraldry â in
your service excellency where everything is learned â go on i am curious to know two thing â what are they your excellency â what became of this little boy for i think you told me it was a boy monsieur_bertuccio â no excellency i do not recollect telling you that â i thought you did i must have been mistaken â no you were not for it was in reality a little boy but your excellency wished to know two thing what was the second â the second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a confessor and the abbã_busoni came to visit you at your request in the prison at nã mes â the story will be very long excellency â what matter you know i take but little sleep and i do not suppose you are very much inclined for it either monsieur_bertuccio bowed and resumed his story partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me partly to supply the wants of the poor widow i eagerly returned to my trade of smuggler which had become more easy since that relaxation of the laws which always follows a revolution the southern districts were ill watched in particular in consequence of the disturbances that were perpetually breaking out in avignon nã mes or uzã we profited by this respite on the part of the government to make friend everywhere since my brotherâ assassination in the streets of nã mes i had never entered the town the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected seeing that we would no longer come to him was forced to come to us and had established a branch to his inn on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire at the sign of the pont du gard
we had thus at aigues mortes martigues or bouc a dozen place where we left our goods and where in case of necessity we concealed ourselves from the gendarmes and custom house_of_peers officers smuggling is a profitable trade when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed as for myself brought up in the mountains i had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and custom house_of_peers officers as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry and an inquiry always look back into the past and in my past life they might find something far more grave than the selling of smuggled cigars or barrels of brandy without a permit so preferring death to capture i accomplished the most astonishing deeds and which more than once showed me that the too great care we take of our bodies is the only obstacle to the success of those projects which require rapid decision and vigorous and determined execution in reality when you have once devoted your life to your enterprises you are no longer the equal of other man or rather other man are no longer your equals and whosoever has taken this resolution feels his strength and resources doubled â philosophy monsieur_bertuccio interrupted the count you have done a little of everything in your life â_oh excellency â no no but philosophy at half past ten at night is somewhat late yet i have no other observation to make for what you say is correct which is more than can be said for all philosophy â my journeys became more and more extensive and more productive assunta took care of all and our little fortune increased one day as i was setting off on an expedition go said she at your return i will give you a surprise
i questioned her but in vain she would tell me nothing and i departed our expedition lasted nearly six weeks we had been to lucca to take in oil to leghorn for english cottons and we ran our cargo without opposition and returned home full of joy when i entered the house_of_peers the first thing i beheld in the middle of assuntaâ chamber was a cradle that might be called sumptuous compared with the rest of the furniture and in it a baby seven or eight month old i uttered a cry of joy the only moment of sadness i had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that i had abandoned this child for the assassination itself i had never felt any remorse poor assunta had guessed all she had profited by my absence and furnished with the half of the linen and having written down the day and hour at which i had deposited the child at the asylum had set off for paris and had reclaimed it no objection was raised and the infant was given up to her ah i confess your excellency when i saw this poor creature sleeping peacefully in its cradle i felt my eye filled with tears ah assunta cried i you are an excellent woman and heaven will bless you â this said count_of_monte_cristo is less correct than your philosophy â_it is only faith â alas your excellency is right replied monsieur_bertuccio and god made this infant the instrument of our punishment never did a perverse nature declare itself more prematurely and yet it was not owing to any fault in his bringing up
he was a most lovely child with large blue eye of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion only his hair which was too light gave his face a most singular expression and added to the vivacity of his look and the malice of his smile unfortunately there is a proverb which says that red is either altogether good or altogether bad the proverb was but too correct as regarded m_benedetto and even in his infancy he manifested the worst disposition it is true that the indulgence of his foster mother encouraged him this child for whom my poor sister would go to the town five or six leagues off to purchase the earliest fruits and the most tempting sweetmeats preferred to palma grapes or genoese preserves the chestnuts stolen from a neighborâ orchard or the dried apples in his loft when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples that grew in my garden one day when m_benedetto was about five or six our neighbor wasilio who according to the custom of the country never locked up his purse or his valuablesâ for as your excellency knows there are no thieves in corsicaâ complained that he had lost a louis_xviii out of his purse we thought he must have made a mistake in counting his money but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement one day m_benedetto who had been gone from the house_of_peers since morning to our great anxiety did not return until late in the evening dragging a monkey after him which he said he had found chained to the foot of a tree for more than a month past the mischievous child who knew not what to wish for had taken it into his head to have a monkey
a boatman who had passed by rogliano and who had several of these animals whose tricks had greatly diverted him had doubtless suggested this idea to him monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees said i confess how you obtained this animal m_benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his veracity i became angry he began to laugh i threatened to strike him and he made two step backwards you cannot beat me said he you have no right for you are not my father 20299m we never knew who had revealed this fatal secret which we had so carefully concealed from him however it was this answer in which the childâ whole character revealed itself that almost terrified me and my arm fell without touching him the boy triumphed and this victory rendered him so audacious that all the money of assunta whose affection for him seemed to increase as he became more unworthy of it was spent in caprices she knew not how to contend against and follies she had not the courage to prevent when i was at rogliano everything went on properly but no sooner was my back turned than m_benedetto became master and everything went ill when he was only eleven he chose his companions from among the young man of eighteen or twenty the worst characters in bastia or indeed in corsica and they had already for some mischievous pranks been several time threatened with a prosecution i became alarmed as any prosecution might be attended with serious consequences
i was compelled at this period to leave corsica on an important expedition i reflected for a long time and with the hope of averting some impending misfortune i resolved that m_benedetto should accompany me i hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler with the severe discipline on board would have a salutary effect on his character which was now well nigh if not quite corrupt i spoke to m_benedetto alone and proposed to him to accompany me endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of a child of twelve he heard me patiently and when i had finished burst out laughing â are you mad uncle he called me by this name when he was in good humor do you think i am going to change the life i lead for your mode of existenceâ my agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil you impose on yourself exposed to the bitter frost at night and the scorching heat by day compelled to conceal yourself and when you are perceived receive a volley of bullets all to earn a paltry sum why i have as much money as i want mother assunta always furnishes me when i ask for it you see that i should be a fool to accept your offer â the arguments and his audacity perfectly stupefied me m_benedetto rejoined his associates and i saw him from a distance point me out to them as a fool â sweet child murmured count_of_monte_cristo â_oh had he been my own son replied monsieur_bertuccio or
even my nephew i would have brought him back to the right road for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength but the idea that i was striking a child whose father i had killed made it impossible for me to punish him i gave my sister who constantly defended the unfortunate boy good advice and as she confessed that she had several time missed money to a considerable amount i showed her a safe place in which to conceal our little treasure for the future my mind was already made up m_benedetto could read write and cipher perfectly for when the fit seized him he learned more in a day than others in a week my intention was to enter him as a clerk in some ship and without letting him know anything of my plan to convey him some morning on board by this means his future treatment would depend upon his own conduct i set off for france after having fixed upon the plan our cargo was to be landed in the gulf of lyons and this was a difficult thing to do because it was then the year 1829 the most perfect tranquillity was restored and the vigilance of the custom house_of_peers officers was redoubled and their strictness was increased at this time in consequence of the fair at beaucaire 20301m our expedition made a favorable beginning we anchored our vesselâ which had a double hold where our goods were concealedâ amidst a number of other vessels that bordered the banks of the rhã ne from beaucaire to arles on our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in the night and to convey it into the town by the help of the innkeeper with whom we were connected
â whether success rendered us imprudent or whether we were betrayed i know not but one evening about five oâ clock our little cabin boy came breathlessly to inform us that he had seen a detachment of custom house_of_peers officers advancing in our direction it was not their proximity that alarmed us for detachments were constantly patrolling along the banks of the rhã ne but the care according to the boyâ account that they took to avoid being seen in an instant we were on the alert but it was too late our vessel was surrounded and amongst the custom house_of_peers officers i observed several gendarmes and as terrified at the sight of their uniforms as i was brave at the sight of any other i sprang into the hold opened a port and dropped into the river dived and only rose at intervals to breathe until i reached a ditch that had recently been made from the rhã ne to the canal that runs from beaucaire to aigues mortes i was now safe for i could swim along the ditch without being seen and i reached the canal in safety i had designedly taken this direction i have already told your excellency of an innkeeper from nã mes who had set up a little tavern on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire â_yes said count_of_monte_cristo i perfectly recollect him i think he was your colleague â precisely answered monsieur_bertuccio but he had seven or eight year before this period sold his establishment to a tailor at marseilles who having almost ruined himself in his old trade wished to make his fortune in another of course we made the same arrangements with the new landlord that we had with the old and it was of this man that i intended to ask shelter
â what was his name inquired the count who seemed to become somewhat interested in bertuccioâ story gaspard_caderousse m_caderousse he had married a woman from the village of la_carconte and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her village she was suffering from malarial fever and seemed dying by inches as for her husband he was a strapping fellow of forty or five and forty who had more than once in time of danger given ample proof of his presence of mind and courage â and you say interrupted count_of_monte_cristo that this took place towards the yearâ â 1829 your excellency â in what month â june â the beginning or the end â the evening of the 3rd 20303m ah said count_of_monte_cristo the evening of the 3rd of june 1829 go on â_it was from m_caderousse that i intended demanding shelter and as we never entered by the door that opened onto the road i resolved not to break through the rule so climbing over the garden hedge i crept amongst the olive and wild fig trees and fearing that m_caderousse might have some guest i entered a kind of shed in which i had often passed the night and which was only separated from the inn by a partition in which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity of announcing our presence my intention was if m_caderousse was alone to acquaint him with my presence finish the meal the custom house_of_peers officers had interrupted and profit by the threatened storm to return to the rhã ne and ascertain the state of our vessel and its crew i stepped into the shed and it was fortunate i did so for at that moment m_caderousse entered with a stranger
â i waited patiently not to overhear what they said but because i could do nothing else besides the same thing had occurred often before the man who was with m_caderousse was evidently a stranger to the south of france he was one of those merchants who come to sell jewellery at the beaucaire fair and who during the month the fair lasts and during which there is so great an influx of merchants and customers from all part of europe often have dealings to the amount of 100 000 to 150 000 franc m_caderousse entered hastily then seeing that the room was as usual empty and only guarded by the dog he called to his wife hello la_carconte said he the worthy priest has not deceived us the diamond is real â an exclamation of joy was heard and the staircase creaked beneath a feeble step what do you say asked his wife pale as death â i say that the diamond is real and that this gentleman one of the first jewellers of paris will give us 50 000 franc for it only in order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us he wishes you to relate to him as i have done already the miraculous manner in which the diamond came into our possession in the meantime please to sit down monsieur_albert and i will fetch you some refreshment â the jeweller examined attentively the interior of the inn and the apparent poverty of the person who were about to sell him a diamond that seemed to have come from the casket of a prince â relate your story madame said he wishing no doubt to profit by the absence of the husband so that the latter could not influence the wifeâ story to see if the two recitals tallied
â â_oh returned she â_it was a gift of heaven my husband was a great friend in 1814 or 1815 of a sailor named edmond_dantã_s this poor fellow whom m_caderousse had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him â but how did he obtain it asked the jeweller had he it before he was imprisoned â no monsieur_albert but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich englishman and as in prison he fell sick and edmond_dantã_s took the same care of him as if he had been his brother the englishman when he was set free gave this stone to edmond_dantã_s who less fortunate died and in his turn left it to us and charged the excellent abbã who was here this morning to deliver it â the same story muttered the jeweller and improbable as it seemed at first it may be true thereâ only the price we are not agreed about â how not agreed about said m_caderousse i thought we agreed for the price i asked â that is replied the jeweller i offered 40 000 franc â forty thousand cried la_carconte we will not part with it for that sum the abbã told us it was worth 50 000 without the setting â what was the abbã s name asked the indefatigable questioner â the abbã_busoni said la_carconte â he was a foreigner â an italian from the neighborhood of mantua i believe â let me see this diamond again replied the jeweller the first time you are often mistaken as to the value of a stone â m_caderousse took from his pocket a small case of black shagreen opened and gave it to the jeweller
at the sight of the diamond which was as large as a hazel nut la carconteâ eye sparkled with cupidity â and what did you think of this fine story eavesdropper said count_of_monte_cristo did you credit it â_yes your excellency i did not look on m_caderousse as a bad man and i thought him incapable of committing a crime or even a theft â that did more honor to your heart than to your experience monsieur_bertuccio had you known this edmond_dantã_s of whom they spoke â no your excellency i had never heard of him before and never but once afterwards and that was from the abbã_busoni himself when i saw him in the prison at nã mes â go on â the jeweller took the ring and drawing from his pocket a pair of steel pliers and a small set of copper scales he took the stone out of its setting and weighed it carefully â i will give you 45 000 said he but not a sou more besides as that is the exact value of the stone i brought just that sum with me â â_oh thatâ no matter replied m_caderousse i will go back with you to fetch the other 000 franc â no returned the jeweller giving back the diamond and the ring to m_caderousse no it is worth no more and i am sorry i offered so much for the stone has a flaw in it which i had not seen however i will not go back on my word and i will give 45 000 â at least replace the diamond in the ring said la_carconte sharply â ah true replied the jeweller and he reset the stone
â no matter observed m_caderousse replacing the box in his pocket someone else will purchase it â â_yes continued the jeweller but someone else will not be so easy as i am or content himself with the same story it is not natural that a man like you should possess such a diamond he will inform against you you will have to find the abbã_busoni and abbã who give diamonds worth two thousand louis_xviii are rare the law would seize it and put you in prison if at the end of three or four month you are set at liberty the ring will be lost or a false stone worth three franc will be given you instead of a diamond worth 50 000 or perhaps 55 000 franc from which you must allow that one runs considerable risk in purchasing â m_caderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each other â no said m_caderousse we are not rich enough to lose 000 franc â as you please my dear sir said the jeweller i had however as you see brought you the money in bright coin and he drew from his pocket a handful of gold and held it sparkling before the dazzled eye of the innkeeper and in the other hand he held a packet of bank notes there was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of m_caderousse it was plain that the small shagreen case which he turned over and over in his hand did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his gaze he turned towards his wife â what do you think of this he asked in a low voice â let him have itâ let him have it she said
â if he returns to beaucaire without the diamond he will inform against us and as he says who knows if we shall ever again see the abbã_busoni in all probability we shall never see him â well then so i will said m_caderousse so you may have the diamond for 45 000 franc but my wife wants a gold chain and i want a pair of silver buckles â the jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box which contained several samples of the articles demanded here he said i am very straightforward in my dealingsâ take your choice â the woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis_xviii and the husband a pair of buckles worth perhaps fifteen franc â i hope you will not complain now said the jeweller â the abbã told me it was worth 50 000 franc muttered m_caderousse â come comeâ give it to me what a strange fellow you are said the jeweller taking the diamond from his hand i give you 45 000 francsâ that is 500 livres of income a fortune such as i wish i had myself and you are not satisfied â and the five and forty thousand franc inquired m_caderousse in a hoarse voice where are they comeâ let us see them â here they are replied the jeweller and he counted out upon the table 15 000 franc in gold and 30 000 franc in bank notes â wait while i light the lamp said la_carconte â_it is growing dark and there may be some mistake in fact night had come on during this conversation and with night the storm which had been threatening for the last half hour the thunder growled in the distance but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller m_caderousse or la_carconte absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain
i myself felt a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these bank notes it seemed to me that i was in a dream and as it always happens in a dream i felt myself riveted to the spot m_caderousse counted and again counted the gold and the notes then handed them to his wife who counted and counted them again in her turn during this time the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight and the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of those whichâ precursors of the stormâ began to play in at the window â well inquired the jeweller is the cash all right â â_yes said m_caderousse give me the pocket book la_carconte and find a bag somewhere â la_carconte went to a cupboard and returned with an old leathern pocket book and a bag from the former she took some greasy letter and put in their place the bank notes and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each which in all probability formed the entire fortune of the miserable couple â there said m_caderousse and now although you have wronged us of perhaps 10 000 franc will you have your supper with us i invite you with good will â thank you replied the jeweller â_it must be getting late and i must return to beaucaireâ my wife will be getting uneasy he drew out his watch and exclaimed morbleu nearly nine oâ clockâ why i shall not get back to beaucaire before midnight good night my friend if the abbã_busoni should by any accident return think of me â in another week you will have left beaucaire remarked m_caderousse for the fair end in a few day â true but that makes no difference
write to me at paris to joannes in the palais royal arcade pierre no 45 i will make the journey on purpose to see him if it is worth while â at this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid that it quite eclipsed the light of the lamp 20307m â see here exclaimed m_caderousse you cannot think of going out in such weather as this â â_oh i am not afraid of thunder said the jeweller â and then there are robbers said la_carconte the road is never very safe during fair time â â_oh as to the robbers said joannes here is something for them and he drew from his pocket a pair of small pistols loaded to the muzzle here said he are dogs who bark and bite at the same time they are for the two first who shall have a longing for your diamond friend m_caderousse â m_caderousse and his wife again interchanged a meaning look it seemed as though they were both inspired at the same time with some horrible thought well then a good journey to you said m_caderousse â thanks replied the jeweller he then took his cane which he had placed against an old cupboard and went out at the moment when he opened the door such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was nearly extinguished â_oh said he this is very nice weather and two leagues to go in such a storm â remain said m_caderousse you can sleep here â â_yes do stay added la_carconte in a tremulous voice we will take every care of you â no i must sleep at beaucaire so once more good night m_caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold
â i can see neither heaven nor earth said the jeweller who was outside the door do i turn to the right or to the left hand â to the right said m_caderousse you cannot go wrongâ the road is bordered by trees on both side â goodâ all right said a voice almost lost in the distance â close the door said la_carconte i do not like open door when it thunders â particularly when there is money in the house_of_peers eh answered m_caderousse double locking the door 20311m he came into the room went to the cupboard took out the bag and pocket book and both began for the third time to count their gold and bank notes i never saw such an expression of cupidity as the flickering lamp revealed in those two countenances the woman especially was hideous her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified her countenance had become livid and her eye resembled burning coals â why she inquired in a hoarse voice did you invite him to sleep here tonight â why said m_caderousse with a shudder why that he might not have the trouble of returning to beaucaire â ah responded the woman with an expression impossible to describe i thought it was for something else â woman womanâ why do you have such idea cried m_caderousse or if you have them why donâ you keep them to yourself â well said la_carconte after a momentâ pause you are not a man â what do you mean added m_caderousse â if you had been a man you would not have let him go from here â woman â or else he should not have reached beaucaire â woman â the road takes a turnâ he is obliged to follow itâ while alongside of the canal there is a shorter road â woman you offend the good god thereâ listen
and at this moment there was a tremendous peal of thunder while the livid lightning illumined the room and the thunder rolling away in the distance seemed to withdraw unwillingly from the cursed abode mercy said m_caderousse crossing himself 20312m at the same moment and in the midst of the terrifying silence which usually follows a clap of thunder they heard a knocking at the door m_caderousse and his wife started and looked aghast at each other â whoâ there cried m_caderousse rising and drawing up in a heap the gold and notes scattered over the table and which he covered with his two hand â_it is i shouted a voice â and who are you â eh pardieu joannes the jeweller â well and you said i offended the good god said la_carconte with a horrid smile why the good god sends him back again m_caderousse sank pale and breathless into his chair la_carconte on the contrary rose and going with a firm step towards the door opened it saying as she did so â come in dear joannes â ma foi said the jeweller drenched with rain i am not destined to return to beaucaire tonight the shortest follies are best my dear m_caderousse you offered me hospitality and i accept it and have returned to sleep beneath your friendly roof â m_caderousse stammered out something while he wiped away the sweat that started to his brow la_carconte double locked the door behind the jeweller chapter 45 the rain of blood as the jeweller returned to the apartment he cast around him a scrutinizing glanceâ but there was nothing to excite suspicion if it did not exist or to confirm it if it were already awakened
caderousseâ hand still grasped the gold and bank notes and la_carconte called up her sweetest smile while welcoming the reappearance of their guest â well well said the jeweller you seem my good friend to have had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money by counting it over so carefully directly i was gone â â_oh no answered m_caderousse that was not my reason i can assure you but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so unexpected as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eye that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream â the jeweller smiled have you any other guests in your house_of_peers inquired he â nobody but ourselves replied m_caderousse the fact is we do not lodge travellersâ indeed our tavern is so near the town that nobody would think of stopping here â then i am afraid i shall very much inconvenience you â inconvenience us not at all my dear sir said la_carconte in her most gracious manner not at all i assure you â but where will you manage to stow me â in the chamber overhead â surely that is where you yourselves sleep â never mind that we have a second bed in the adjoining room â m_caderousse stared at his wife with much astonishment the jeweller meanwhile was humming a song as he stood warming his back at the fire la_carconte had kindled to dry the wet garments of her guest and this done she next occupied herself in arranging his supper by spreading a napkin at the end of the table and placing on it the slender remains of their dinner to which she added three or four fresh laid eggs
caderousse had once more parted with his treasureâ the banknotes were replaced in the pocket book the gold put back into the bag and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard he then began pacing the room with a pensive and gloomy air glancing from time to time at the jeweller who stood reeking with the steam from his wet clothes and merely changing his place on the warm hearth to enable the whole of his garments to be dried â there said la_carconte as she placed a bottle of wine on the table supper is ready whenever you are â and you asked joannes â i donâ want any supper said m_caderousse â we dined so very late hastily interposed la_carconte â then it seems i am to eat alone remarked the jeweller â_oh we shall have the pleasure of waiting upon you answered la_carconte with an eager attention she was not accustomed to manifest even to guests who paid for what they took from time to time m_caderousse darted on his wife keen searching glances but rapid as the lightning flash the storm still continued â there there said la_carconte do you hear that upon my word you did well to come back â nevertheless replied the jeweller if by the time i have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated i shall make another start â itâ the mistral said m_caderousse and it will be sure to last till tomorrow morning he sighed heavily â well said the jeweller as he placed himself at table all i can say is so much the worse for those who are abroad â â_yes chimed in la_carconte they will have a wretched night of it
â the jeweller began eating his supper and the woman who was ordinarily so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her was suddenly transformed into the most smiling and attentive hostess had the unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with her so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his mind or at least have greatly astonished him m_caderousse meanwhile continued to pace the room in gloomy silence sedulously avoiding the sight of his guest but as soon as the stranger had completed his repast the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the door and opened it â i believe the storm is over said he but as if to contradict his statement at that instant a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the house_of_peers to its very foundation while a sudden gust of wind mingled with rain extinguished the lamp he held in his hand trembling and awe struck m_caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to his guest while la_carconte lighted a candle by the smouldering ashes that glimmered on the hearth â you must be tired said she to the jeweller i have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed go up when you are ready and sleep well â joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in its fury but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that instead of diminishing the violence of the rain and thunder momentarily increased resigning himself therefore to what seemed inevitable he bade his host good night and mounted the stairs he passed over my head and i heard the flooring creak beneath his footsteps
the quick eager glance of la_carconte followed him as he ascended while m_caderousse on the contrary turned his back and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at him all these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as they have since done in fact all that had happened with the exception of the story of the diamond which certainly did wear an air of improbability appeared natural enough and called for neither apprehension nor mistrust but worn out as i was with fatigue and fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated i determined to obtain a few hoursâ sleep overhead i could accurately distinguish every movement of the jeweller who after making the best arrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night threw himself on his bed and i could hear it creak and groan beneath his weight insensibly my eyelids grew heavy deep sleep stole over me and having no suspicion of anything wrong i sought not to shake it off i looked into the kitchen once more and saw m_caderousse sitting by the side of a long table upon one of the low wooden stools which in country place are frequently used instead of chairs his back was turned towards me so that i could not see the expression of his countenanceâ neither should i have been able to do so had he been placed differently as his head was buried between his two hand la_carconte continued to gaze on him for some time then shrugging her shoulders she took her seat immediately opposite to him at this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the kindling of a piece of wood that lay near and a bright light flashed over the room
la la_carconte still kept her eye fixed on her husband but as he made no sign of changing his position she extended her hard bony hand and touched him on the forehead 20317m m_caderousse shuddered the womanâ lip seemed to move as though she were talking but because she merely spoke in an undertone or my senses were dulled by sleep i did not catch a word she uttered confused sights and sounds seemed to float before me and gradually i fell into a deep heavy slumber how long i had been in this unconscious state i know not when i was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol followed by a fearful cry weak and tottering footsteps resounded across the chamber above me and the next instant a dull heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the staircase i had not yet fully recovered consciousness when again i heard groans mingled with half stifled cries as if from person engaged in a deadly struggle a cry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my drowsy lethargy hastily raising myself on one arm i looked around but all was dark and it seemed to me as if the rain must have penetrated through the flooring of the room above for some kind of moisture appeared to fall drop by drop upon my forehead and when i passed my hand across my brow i felt that it was wet and clammy to the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most perfect silenceâ unbroken save by the footsteps of a man walking about in the chamber above the staircase creaked he descended into the room below approached the fire and lit a candle
â the man was caderousseâ he was pale and his shirt was all bloody having obtained the light he hurried upstairs again and once more i heard his rapid and uneasy footsteps a moment later he came down again holding in his hand the small shagreen case which he opened to assure himself it contained the diamond seemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in then as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket he deposited it in his red handkerchief which he carefully rolled round his head after this he took from his cupboard the bank notes and gold he had put there thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers and the other into that of his waistcoat hastily tied up a small bundle of linen and rushing towards the door disappeared in the darkness of the night then all became clear and manifest to me and i reproached myself with what had happened as though i myself had done the guilty deed i fancied that i still heard faint moans and imagining that the unfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead i determined to go to his relief by way of atoning in some slight degree not for the crime i had committed but for that which i had not endeavored to prevent for this purpose i applied all the strength i possessed to force an entrance from the cramped spot in which i lay to the adjoining room the poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts and i found myself in the house_of_peers hastily snatching up the lighted candle i hurried to the staircase about midway a body was lying quite across the stairs it was that of la_carconte
the pistol i had heard had doubtless been fired at her the shot had frightfully lacerated her throat leaving two gaping wounds from which as well as the mouth the blood was pouring in floods she was stone dead i strode past her and ascended to the sleeping chamber which presented an appearance of the wildest disorder the furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there and the sheets to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung were dragged across the room the murdered man lay on the floor his head leaning against the wall and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth from three large wounds in his breast there was a fourth gash in which a long table knife was plunged up to the handle i stumbled over some object i stooped to examineâ it was the second pistol which had not gone off probably from the powder being wet i approached the jeweller who was not quite dead and at the sound of my footsteps and the creaking of the floor he opened his eye fixed them on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze moved his lip as though trying to speak then overcome by the effort fell back and expired this appalling sight almost bereft me of my senses and finding that i could no longer be of service to anyone in the house_of_peers my only desire was to fly i rushed towards the staircase clutching my hair and uttering a groan of horror upon reaching the room below i found five or six custom house_of_peers officers and two or three gendarmesâ all heavily armed they threw themselves upon me i made no resistance i was no longer master of my senses
when i strove to speak a few inarticulate sounds alone escaped my lip as i noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to my blood stained garments i involuntarily surveyed myself and then i discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as i lay beneath the staircase must have been the blood of la_carconte i pointed to the spot where i had concealed myself â what does he mean asked a gendarme one of the officers went to the place i directed â he means replied the man upon his return that he got in that way and he showed the hole i had made when i broke through then i saw that they took me for the assassin i recovered force and energy enough to free myself from the hand of those who held me while i managed to stammer forth â i did not do it indeed indeed i did not â a couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their carbines against my breast â stir but a step said they and you are a dead man â why should you threaten me with death cried i when i have already declared my innocence â tush tush cried the man keep your innocent stories to tell to the judge at nã mes meanwhile come along with us and the best advice we can give you is to do so unresistingly â alas resistance was far from my thoughts i was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror and without a word i suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horseâ tail and thus they took me to nã mes
â i had been tracked by a customs officer who had lost sight of me near the tavern feeling certain that i intended to pass the night there he had returned to summon his comrades who just arrived in time to hear the report of the pistol and to take me in the midst of such circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my innocence utterly futile one only chance was left me that of beseeching the magistrate before whom i was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the abbã_busoni who had stopped at the inn of the pont du gard on that morning if m_caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond and there existed no such person as the abbã_busoni then indeed i was lost past redemption or at least my life hung upon the feeble chance of m_caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth two month passed away in hopeless expectation on my part while i must do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to obtain information of the person i declared could exculpate me if he would m_caderousse still evaded all pursuit and i had resigned myself to what seemed my inevitable fate my trial was to come on at the approaching assizes when on the 8th of septemberâ that is to say precisely three month and five day after the events which had perilled my lifeâ the abbã_busoni whom i never ventured to believe i should see presented himself at the prison door saying he understood one of the prisoners wished to speak to him he added that having learned at marseilles the particulars of my imprisonment he hastened to comply with my desire
â you may easily imagine with what eagerness i welcomed him and how minutely i related the whole of what i had seen and heard i felt some degree of nervousness as i entered upon the history of the diamond but to my inexpressible astonishment he confirmed it in every particular and to my equal surprise he seemed to place entire belief in all i said and then it was that won by his mild charity seeing that he was acquainted with all the habits and customs of my own country and considering also that pardon for the only crime of which i was really guilty might come with a double power from lip so benevolent and kind i besought him to receive my confession under the seal of which i recounted the auteuil affair in all its details as well as every other transaction of my life that which i had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of calculation my voluntary confession of the assassination at auteuil proved to him that i had not committed that of which i stood accused when he quitted me he bade me be of good courage and to rely upon his doing all in his power to convince my judges of my innocence i had speedy proofs that the excellent abbã was engaged in my behalf for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling though acceptable indulgences and i was told that my trial was to be postponed to the assizes following those now being held in
the interim it pleased providence to cause the apprehension of m_caderousse who was discovered in some distant country and brought back to france where he made a full confession refusing to make the fact of his wifeâ having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt the wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life and i was immediately set at liberty â and then it was i presume said count_of_monte_cristo that you came to me as the bearer of a letter from the abbã_busoni â_it was your excellency the benevolent abbã took an evident interest in all that concerned me â your mode of life as a smuggler said he to me one day will be the ruin of you if you get out donâ take it up again â but how inquired i am i to maintain myself and my poor sister â a person whose confessor i am replied he and who entertains a high regard for me applied to me a short time since to procure him a confidential servant would you like such a post if so i will give you a letter of introduction to him â â_oh father i exclaimed you are very good â but you must swear solemnly that i shall never have reason to repent my recommendation â i extended my hand and was about to pledge myself by any promise he would dictate but he stopped me â_it is unnecessary for you to bind yourself by any vow said he i know and admire the corsican nature too well to fear you
here take this continued he after rapidly writing the few lines i brought to your excellency and upon receipt of which you deigned to receive me into your service and proudly i ask whether your excellency has ever had cause to repent having done so â no replied the count i take pleasure in saying that you have served me faithfully monsieur_bertuccio but you might have shown more confidence in me â i your excellency â_yes you how comes it that having both a sister and an adopted son you have never spoken to me of either 20323m alas i have still to recount the most distressing period of my life anxious as you may suppose i was to behold and comfort my dear sister i lost no time in hastening to corsica but when i arrived at rogliano i found a house_of_peers of mourning the consequences of a scene so horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day acting by my advice my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of m_benedetto who was continually tormenting her for money as long as he believed there was a sou left in her possession one morning he threatened her with the severest consequences if she did not supply him with what he desired and disappeared and remained away all day leaving the kind hearted assunta who loved him as if he were her own child to weep over his conduct and bewail his absence evening came and still with all the patient solicitude of a mother she watched for his return as the eleventh hour struck he entered with a swaggering air attended by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions
she stretched out her arm to him but they seized hold of her and one of the threeâ none other than the accursed m_benedetto exclaimed â put her to torture and sheâ ll soon tell us where her money is â_it unfortunately happened that our neighbor wasilio was at bastia leaving no person in his house_of_peers but his wife no human creature beside could hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling two held poor assunta who unable to conceive that any harm was intended to her smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her executioners the third proceeded to barricade the door and window then returned and the three united in stifling the cries of terror incited by the sight of these preparations and then dragged assunta foot foremost towards the brazier expecting to wring from her an avowal of where her supposed treasure was secreted in the struggle her clothes caught fire and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate covered with flames assunta rushed wildly to the door but it was fastened she flew to the window but they were also secured then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks it was assunta calling for help the cries died away in groans and next morning as soon as wasilioâ wife could muster up courage to venture abroad she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public authorities when assunta although dreadfully burnt was found still breathing every drawer and closet in the house_of_peers had been forced open and the money stolen m_benedetto never again appeared at rogliano neither have i since that day either seen or heard anything concerning him
â it was subsequently to these dreadful events that i waited on your excellency to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned m_benedetto since all trace of him seemed entirely lost or of my sister since she was dead â and in what light did you view the occurrence inquired count_of_monte_cristo as a punishment for the crime i had committed answered monsieur_bertuccio â_oh those villeforts are an accursed race â truly they are murmured the count in a lugubrious tone and now resumed monsieur_bertuccio your excellency may perhaps be able to comprehend that this place which i revisit for the first timeâ this garden the actual scene of my crimeâ must have given rise to reflections of no very agreeable nature and produced that gloom and depression of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency who was pleased to express a desire to know the cause at this instant a shudder passes over me as i reflect that possibly i am now standing on the very grave in which lies m_noirtier_de_villefort by whose hand the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child â everything is possible said count_of_monte_cristo rising from the bench on which he had been sitting even he added in an inaudible voice even that the procureur be not dead the abbã_busoni did right to send you to me he went on in his ordinary tone and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your history as it will prevent my forming any erroneous opinions concerning you in future
as for that m_benedetto who so grossly belied his name have you never made any effort to trace out whither he has gone or what has become of him â no far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself i should shun the possibility of meeting him as i would a wild beast thank god i have never heard his name mentioned by any person and i hope and believe he is dead â do not think so monsieur_bertuccio replied the count for the wicked are not so easily disposed of for god seems to have them under his special watch care to make of them instruments of his vengeance â so be it responded monsieur_bertuccio all i ask of heaven is that i may never see him again and now your excellency he added bowing his head you know everythingâ you are my judge on earth as the almighty is in heaven have you for me no word of consolation â my good friend i can only repeat the word addressed to you by the abbã_busoni m_noirtier_de_villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you and perhaps to others m_benedetto if still living will become the instrument of divine retribution in some way or other and then be duly punished in his turn as far as you yourself are concerned i see but one point in which you are really guilty ask yourself wherefore after rescuing the infant from its living grave you did not restore it to its mother there was the crime bertuccioâ that was where you became really culpable â true excellency that was the crime the real crime for in that i acted like a coward
my first duty directly i had succeeded in recalling the babe to life was to restore it to its mother but in order to do so i must have made close and careful inquiry which would in all probability have led to my own apprehension and i clung to life partly on my sisterâ account and partly from that feeling of pride inborn in our heart of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the execution of our vengeance perhaps too the natural and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own and then again i am not as brave and courageous as was my poor brother monsieur_bertuccio hid his face in his hand as he uttered these word while count_of_monte_cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning after a brief silence rendered still more solemn by the time and place the count said in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner in order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination the last we shall ever hold upon this subject i will repeat to you some word i have heard from the lip of the abbã_busoni for all evils there are two remediesâ time and silence and now leave me monsieur_albert monsieur_bertuccio to walk alone here in the garden the very circumstances which inflict on you as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here such painful emotions are to me on the contrary a source of something like contentment and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation the chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of their umbrageous boughs while fancy pictures a moving multitude of shapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade
here i have a garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the imagination and furnished with thickly grown trees beneath whose leafy screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will this to me who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight wall is i assure you a most agreeable surprise i have no fear of ghosts and i have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand year as is wrought by the living in a single day retire within monsieur_bertuccio and tranquillize your mind should your confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying moment than you found the abbã_busoni send for me if i am still on earth and i will soothe your ears with word that shall effectually calm and soothe your parting soul ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity monsieur_bertuccio bowed respectfully and turned away sighing heavily count_of_monte_cristo left alone took three or four step onwards and murmured here beneath this plane tree must have been where the infantâ grave was dug there is the little door opening into the garden at this corner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping apartment there will be no necessity for me to make a note of these particulars for there before my eye beneath my foot all around me i have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth after making the tour of the garden a second time the count re entered his carriage while monsieur_bertuccio who perceived the thoughtful expression of his masterâ features took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word the carriage proceeded rapidly towards paris
that same evening upon reaching his abode in the champs lysã es the count_of_monte_cristo went over the whole building with the air of one long acquainted with each nook or corner nor although preceding the party did he once mistake one door for another or commit the smallest error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him to a place or suite of room he desired to visit ali_pasha_of_yanina was his principal attendant during this nocturnal survey having given various order to monsieur_bertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired to make in the house_of_peers the count drawing out his watch said to the attentive nubian â_it is half past eleven oâ clock haydã_e will soon be here have the french attendants been summoned to await her coming ali_pasha_of_yanina extended his hand towards the apartments destined for the fair greek which were so effectually concealed by means of a tapestried entrance that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined their existence ali_pasha_of_yanina having pointed to the apartments held up three fingers of his right hand and then placing it beneath his head shut his eye and feigned to sleep i understand said count_of_monte_cristo well acquainted with aliâ pantomime you mean to tell me that three female attendants await their new mistress in her sleeping chamber ali_pasha_of_yanina with considerable animation made a sign in the affirmative madame will be tired tonight continued count_of_monte_cristo and will no doubt wish to rest desire the french attendants not to weary her with questions but merely to pay their respectful duty and retire you will also see that the greek servant hold no communication with those of this country he bowed just at that moment voice were heard hailing the concierge
the gate opened a carriage rolled down the avenue and stopped at the step the count hastily descended presented himself at the already opened carriage door and held out his hand to a young woman completely enveloped in a green silk mantle heavily embroidered with gold she raised the hand extended towards her to her lip and kissed it with a mixture of love and respect some few word passed between them in that sonorous language in which homer makes his gods converse the young woman spoke with an expression of deep tenderness while the count replied with an air of gentle gravity preceded by ali_pasha_of_yanina who carried a rose colored flambeau in his hand the young lady who was no other than the lovely greek who had been monte cristoâ companion in italy was conducted to her apartments while the count retired to the pavilion reserved for himself in another hour every light in the house_of_peers was extinguished and it might have been thought that all its inmates slept chapter 46 unlimited credit
about two oâ clock the following day a calash drawn by a pair of magnificent english horse stopped at the door of count_of_monte_cristo and a person dressed in a blue coat with buttons of a similar color a white waistcoat over which was displayed a massive gold chain brown trousers and a quantity of black hair descending so low over his eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so little did its jetty glossiness assimilate with the deep wrinkles stamped on his featuresâ a person in a word who although evidently past fifty desired to be taken for not more than forty bent forwards from the carriage door on the panels of which were emblazoned the armorial bearings of a baron and directed his groom to inquire at the porterâ lodge whether the count_of_monte_cristo resided there and if he were within while waiting the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house_of_peers the garden as far as he could distinguish it and the livery of servant who passed to and fro with an attention so close as to be somewhat impertinent
his glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence his lip were straight and so thin that as they closed they were drawn in over the teeth his cheek bones were broad and projecting a never failing proof of audacity and craftiness while the flatness of his forehead and the enlargement of the back of his skull which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing save in the eye of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt and the red ribbon that depended from his button hole the groom in obedience to his order tapped at the window of the porterâ lodge saying pray does not the count_of_monte_cristo live here â his excellency does reside here replied the concierge butâ â added he glancing an inquiring look at ali_pasha_of_yanina ali returned a sign in the negative but what asked the groom his excellency does not receive visitors today â then here is my masterâ card the baron mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars you will take it to the count and say that although in haste to attend the chamber my master came out of his way to have the honor of calling upon him â i never speak to his excellency replied the concierge the valet de chambre will carry your message the groom returned to the carriage well asked mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars the man somewhat crest fallen by the rebuke he had received repeated what the concierge had said bless me murmured baron mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars this must surely be a prince instead of a count by their styling him
â excellency and only venturing to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre however it does not signify he has a letter of credit on me so i must see him when he requires his money then throwing himself back in his carriage mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars called out to his coachman in a voice that might be heard across the road to the chamber of deputies apprised in time of the visit paid him count_of_monte_cristo had from behind the blinds of his pavilion as minutely observed the baron by means of an excellent lorgnette as mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars himself had scrutinized the house_of_peers garden and servant that fellow has a decidedly bad countenance said the count in a tone of disgust as he shut up his glass into its ivory case how comes it that all do not retreat in aversion at sight of that flat receding serpent like forehead round vulture shaped head and sharp hooked nose like the beak of a buzzard ali_pasha_of_yanina cried he striking at the same time on the brazen gong ali_pasha_of_yanina appeared summon monsieur_bertuccio said the count almost immediately monsieur_bertuccio entered the apartment did your excellency desire to see me inquired he i did replied the count you no doubt observed the horse standing a few minute since at the door â certainly your excellency i noticed them for their remarkable beauty â then how comes it said count_of_monte_cristo with a frown that when i desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horse to be found in paris there is another pair fully as fine as mine not in my stables at the look of displeasure added to the angry tone in which the count spoke ali_pasha_of_yanina turned pale and held down his head
â it is not your fault my good ali_pasha_of_yanina said the count in the arabic language and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of showing either in voice or faceâ â_it is not your fault you do not understand the points of english horse the countenance of poor ali_pasha_of_yanina recovered its serenity permit me to assure your excellency said monsieur_bertuccio that the horse you speak of were not to be sold when i purchased yours count_of_monte_cristo shrugged his shoulders â_it seems sir steward said he that you have yet to learn that all thing are to be sold to such as care to pay the price â his excellency is not perhaps aware that mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars gave 16 000 franc for his horse â very well then offer him double that sum a banker never loses an opportunity of doubling his capital â is your excellency really in earnest inquired the steward count_of_monte_cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his word with the look of one equally surprised and displeased i have to pay a visit this evening replied he i desire that these horse with completely new harness may be at the door with my carriage monsieur_bertuccio bowed and was about to retire but when he reached the door he paused and then said at what oâ clock does your excellency wish the carriage and horse to be ready â at five oâ clock replied the count i beg your excellencyâ pardon interposed the steward in a deprecating manner for venturing to observe that it is already two oâ clock â i am perfectly aware of that fact answered count_of_monte_cristo calmly then turning towards ali_pasha_of_yanina he said let
all the horse in my stables be led before the window of your young lady that she may select those she prefers for her carriage request her also to oblige me by saying whether it is her pleasure to dine with me if so let dinner be served in her apartments now leave me and desire my valet de chambre to come hither scarcely had ali_pasha_of_yanina disappeared when the valet entered the chamber monsieur_albert monsieur_baptistin said the count you have been in my service one year the time i generally give myself to judge of the merits or demerits of those about me you suit me very well monsieur_baptistin bowed low â_it only remains for me to know whether i also suit you â_oh your excellency exclaimed monsieur_baptistin eagerly listen if you please till i have finished speaking replied count_of_monte_cristo you receive 500 franc per annum for your services hereâ more than many a brave subaltern who continually risks his life for his country obtains you live in a manner far superior to many clerks who work ten time harder than you do for their money then though yourself a servant you have other servant to wait upon you take care of your clothes and see that your linen is duly prepared for you again you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet amounting in the course of a year to a sum equalling your wages â nay indeed your excellency â i am not condemning you for this monsieur_albert monsieur_baptistin but let your profits end here it would be long indeed ere you would find so lucrative a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill i neither ill use nor ill treat my servant by word or action
an error i readily forgive but wilful negligence or forgetfulness never my commands are ordinarily short clear and precise and i would rather be obliged to repeat my word twice or even three time than they should be misunderstood i am rich enough to know whatever i desire to know and i can promise you i am not wanting in curiosity if then i should learn that you had taken upon yourself to speak of me to anyone favorably or unfavorably to comment on my actions or watch my conduct that very instant you would quit my service you may now retire i never caution my servant a second timeâ remember that monsieur_baptistin bowed and was proceeding towards the door i forgot to mention to you said the count that i lay yearly aside a certain sum for each servant in my establishment those whom i am compelled to dismiss lose as a matter of course all participation in this money while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those domestics who remain with me and among whom it will be divided at my death you have been in my service a year your fund has already begun to accumulateâ let it continue to do so this address delivered in the presence of ali_pasha_of_yanina who not understanding one word of the language in which it was spoken stood wholly unmoved produced an effect on monsieur_baptistin only to be conceived by such as have occasion to study the character and disposition of french domestics i assure your excellency said he that at least it shall be my study to merit your approbation in all thing and i will take ali_pasha_of_yanina as my model â by
no means replied the count in the most frigid tone ali_pasha_of_yanina has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities he cannot possibly serve you as a pattern for your conduct not being as you are a paid servant but a mere slaveâ a dog who should he fail in his duty towards me i should not discharge from my service but kill monsieur_baptistin opened his eye with astonishment you seem incredulous said count_of_monte_cristo who repeated to ali_pasha_of_yanina in the arabic language what he had just been saying to monsieur_baptistin in french the nubian smiled assentingly to his masterâ word then kneeling on one knee respectfully kissed the hand of the count this corroboration of the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the wonder and stupefaction of monsieur_baptistin the count then motioned the valet de chambre to retire and to ali_pasha_of_yanina to follow to his study where they conversed long and earnestly together as the hand of the clock pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong when ali_pasha_of_yanina was wanted one stroke was given two summoned monsieur_baptistin and three monsieur_bertuccio the steward entered my horse said count_of_monte_cristo they are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency desired does your excellency wish me to accompany him â no the coachman ali_pasha_of_yanina and monsieur_baptistin will go the count descended to the door of his mansion and beheld his carriage drawn by the very pair of horse he had so much admired in the morning as the property of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars
as he passed them he said they are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner â indeed your excellency i had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them and as it is they have cost an enormous price â does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful inquired the count shrugging his shoulders nay if your excellency is satisfied it is all that i could wish whither does your excellency desire to be driven â to the residence of baron mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars rue de la chaussã dâ antin this conversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace from which a flight of stone step led to the carriage drive as monsieur_bertuccio with a respectful bow was moving away the count called him back i have another commission for you monsieur_bertuccio said he i am desirous of having an estate by the seaside in normandyâ for instance between le havre and boulogne you see i give you a wide range it will be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have a small harbor creek or bay into which my corvette can enter and remain at anchor she draws only fifteen foot she must be kept in constant readiness to sail immediately i think proper to give the signal make the requisite inquiries for a place of this description and when you have met with an eligible spot visit it and if it possess the advantages desired purchase it at once in your own name the corvette must now i think be on her way to fã camp must she not 20333m certainly your excellency i saw her put to sea the same evening we quitted marseilles â and the yacht â was ordered to remain at martigues â tis well
i wish you to write from time to time to the captains in charge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the alert â and the steamboat â she is at chã lons â_yes â the same order for her as for the two sailing vessels â very good â when you have purchased the estate i desire i want constant relays of horse at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern road â your excellency may depend upon me the count made a gesture of satisfaction descended the terrace step and sprang into his carriage which was whirled along swiftly to the bankerâ house_of_peers mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was engaged at that moment presiding over a railroad committee but the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced as the countâ title sounded on his ear he rose and addressing his colleagues who were members of one or the other chamber he said gentlemen pardon me for leaving you so abruptly but a most ridiculous circumstance has occurred which is this thomson_french_of_rome the roman bankers have sent to me a certain person calling himself the count_of_monte_cristo and have given him an unlimited credit with me i confess this is the drollest thing i have ever met with in the course of my extensive foreign transactions and you may readily suppose it has greatly roused my curiosity i took the trouble this morning to call on the pretended countâ if he were a real count he wouldnâ be so rich but would you believe it he was not receiving so the master of count_of_monte_cristo gives himself air befitting a great millionaire or a capricious beauty
i made inquiries and found that the house_of_peers in the champs lysã es is his own property and certainly it was very decently kept up but pursued mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with one of his sinister smile an order for unlimited credit calls for something like caution on the part of the banker to whom that order is given i am very anxious to see this man i suspect a hoax is intended but the instigators of it little knew whom they had to deal with they laugh best who laugh last â having delivered himself of this pompous address uttered with a degree of energy that left the baron almost out of breath he bowed to the assembled party and withdrew to his drawing room whose sumptuous furnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the chaussã dâ antin it was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much luxury he found the count standing before some copies of albano and fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals but which mere copies as they were seemed to feel their degradation in being brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the ceiling the count turned round as he heard the entrance of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars into the room with a slight inclination of the head mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars signed to the count to be seated pointing significantly to a gilded armchair covered with white satin embroidered with gold the count sat down 20335m i have the honor i presume of addressing de count_of_monte_cristo the count bowed
â and i of speaking to baron mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars chevalier of the legion of honor and member of the chamber of deputies count_of_monte_cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the baronâ card mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars felt the irony and compressed his lip you will i trust excuse me monsieur_albert for not calling you by your title when i first addressed you he said but you are aware that we are living under a popular form of government and that i am myself a representative of the liberties of the people â so much so replied count_of_monte_cristo that while you call yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count â upon my word monsieur_albert said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with affected carelessness i attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions but the fact is i was made baron and also chevalier of the legion of honor in return for services rendered butâ â but you have discarded your titles after the example set you by messrs de montmorency and lafayette that was a noble example to follow monsieur_albert â why replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars not entirely so with the servant you understand â i see to your domestics you are my lord the journalists style you monsieur_albert while your constituents call you citizen these are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government i understand perfectly again mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars bit his lip he saw that he was no match for count_of_monte_cristo in an argument of this sort and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more congenial permit me to inform you count said he bowing that i have received a letter of advice from thomson_french_of_rome â i am glad to hear it baron for i must claim the privilege of addressing you after the manner of your servant
i have acquired the bad habit of calling person by their titles from living in a country where barons are still barons by right of birth but as regards the letter of advice i am charmed to find that it has reached you that will spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for money myself you have received a regular letter of advice â_yes said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars but i confess i didnâ quite comprehend its meaning â indeed â and for that reason i did myself the honor of calling upon you in order to beg for an explanation â go on monsieur_albert here i am ready to give you any explanation you desire â why said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars in the letterâ i believe i have it about meâ here he felt in his breast pocketâ â_yes here it is well this letter gives the count_of_monte_cristo unlimited credit on our house_of_peers â well baron what is there difficult to understand about that â merely the term unlimited nothing else certainly â is not that word known in france the people who wrote are anglo germans you know â_oh as for the composition of the letter there is nothing to be said but as regards the competency of the document i certainly have doubts â is it possible asked the count assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor is it possible that thomson_french_of_rome are not looked upon as safe and solvent bankers pray tell me what you think baron for i feel uneasy i can assure you having some considerable property in their hand â thomson_french_of_rome are perfectly solvent replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with an almost mocking smile but the word unlimited in financial affairs is so extremely vague â is in fact unlimited said count_of_monte_cristo
â precisely what i was about to say cried mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars now what is vague is doubtful and it was a wise man who said when in doubt keep out â meaning to say rejoined count_of_monte_cristo that however thomson_french_of_rome may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly the baron mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is not disposed to follow their example â not at all â plainly enough messrs thomson_french_of_rome set no bounds to their engagements while those of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars have their limits he is a wise man according to his own showing â monsieur_albert replied the banker drawing himself up with a haughty air the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned â_it seems then reserved for me said count_of_monte_cristo coldly to be the first to do so â by what right sir â by right of the objections you have raised and the explanations you have demanded which certainly must have some motive once more mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars bit his lip it was the second time he had been worsted and this time on his own ground his forced politeness sat awkwardly upon him and approached almost to impertinence count_of_monte_cristo on the contrary preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure and thus possessed the advantage well sir resumed mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars after a brief silence i will endeavor to make myself understood by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me â why truly replied count_of_monte_cristo determined not to lose an inch of the ground he had gained my reason for desiring an unlimitedâ credit was precisely because i did not know how much money i might need the banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand
so throwing himself back in his armchair he said with an arrogant and purse proud air let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes you will then be convinced that the resources of the house_of_peers of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars however limited are still equal to meeting the largest demands and were you even to require a millionâ â i beg your pardon interposed count_of_monte_cristo i said a million replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with the confidence of ignorance but could i do with a million retorted the count my dear sir if a trifle like that could suffice me i should never have given myself the trouble of opening an account a million excuse my smiling when you speak of a sum i am in the habit of carrying in my pocket book or dressing case and with these word count_of_monte_cristo took from his pocket a small case containing his visiting cards and drew forth two order on the treasury for 500 000 franc each payable at sight to the bearer a man like mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of correction the effect of the present revelation was stunning he trembled and was on the verge of apoplexy the pupils of his eye as he gazed at count_of_monte_cristo dilated horribly come come said count_of_monte_cristo confess honestly that you have not perfect confidence in thomson_french_of_rome i understand and foreseeing that such might be the case i took in spite of my ignorance of affairs certain precautions see here are two similar letter to that you have yourself received one from the house_of_peers of arstein eskeles of vienna to baron rothschild the other drawn by baring of london upon lafitte
now sir you have but to say the word and i will spare you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two firms the blow had struck home and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was entirely vanquished with a trembling hand he took the two letter from the count who held them carelessly between finger and thumb and proceeded to scrutinize the signatures with a minuteness that the count might have regarded as insulting had it not suited his present purpose to mislead the banker â_oh sir said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars after he had convinced himself of the authenticity of the documents he held and rising as if to salute the power of gold personified in the man before him â three letter of unlimited credit i can be no longer mistrustful but you must pardon me my dear count for confessing to some degree of astonishment â nay answered count_of_monte_cristo with the most gentlemanly air â tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house_of_peers is to be incommoded then you can let me have some money can you not â whatever you say my dear count i am at your order â why replied count_of_monte_cristo since we mutually understand each otherâ for such i presume is the case mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars bowed assentingly
â you are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind â_oh my dear count exclaimed mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you â no you merely wished to be convinced nothing more but now that we have come to so clear an understanding and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year suppose we say six millions toâ â six millions gasped danglarsâ so be it â then if i should require more continued count_of_monte_cristo in a careless manner why of course i should draw upon you but my present intention is not to remain in france more than a year and during that period i scarcely think i shall exceed the sum i mentioned however we shall see be kind enough then to send me 500 000 franc tomorrow i shall be at home till midday or if not i will leave a receipt with my steward â the money you desire shall be at your house_of_peers by ten oâ clock tomorrow morning my dear count replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars how would you like to have it in gold silver or notes â half in gold and the other half in bank notes if you please said the count rising from his seat i must confess to you count said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars that i have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortune of europe and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me may i presume to ask whether you have long possessed it â_it has been in the family a very long while returned count_of_monte_cristo
â a sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain period of year during which the accumulated interest has doubled the capital the period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches occurred only a short time ago and they have only been employed by me within the last few year your ignorance on the subject therefore is easily accounted for however you will be better informed as to me and my possessions ere long and the count while pronouncing these latter word accompanied them with one of those ghastly smile that used to strike terror into poor m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay with your tastes and means of gratifying them continued mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable millionaires quite in the shade if i mistake not you are an admirer of paintings at least i judged so from the attention you appeared to be bestowing on mine when i entered the room if you will permit me i shall be happy to show you my picture gallery composed entirely of works by the ancient mastersâ warranted as such not a modern picture among them i cannot endure the modern school of painting â you are perfectly right in objecting to them for this one great faultâ that they have not yet had time to become old â or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by thorwaldsen bartoloni and canova all foreign artists for as you may perceive i think but very indifferently of our french sculptors â you have a right to be unjust to them monsieur_albert they are your compatriots â but all this may come later when we shall be better known to each other
for the present i will confine myself if perfectly agreeable to you to introducing you to the baroness danglarsâ excuse my impatience my dear count but a client like you is almost like a member of the family count_of_monte_cristo bowed in sign that he accepted the proffered honor mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery is the baroness at home inquired mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â_yes my lord answered the man and alone â no my lord madame has visitors â have you any objection to meet any person who may be with madame or do you desire to preserve a strict incognito â no indeed replied count_of_monte_cristo with a smile i do not arrogate to myself the right of so doing â and who is with madame m_lucien_debray inquired mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with an air of indulgence and good nature that made count_of_monte_cristo smile acquainted as he was with the secrets of the bankerâ domestic life â_yes my lord replied the servant m_lucien_debray is with madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars nodded his head then turning to count_of_monte_cristo said m_lucien_debray is an old friend of ours and private secretary to the minister of the interior as for my wife i must tell you she lowered herself by marrying me for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in france her maiden name was de serviã res and her first husband was colonel the marquis of nargonne â i have not the honor of knowing madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars but i have already met m_lucien_debray â ah indeed said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and where was that â at the house_of_peers of de viscount_albert_de_morcerf â ah you are acquainted with the young viscount are you â we were together a good deal during the carnival at rome â true true cried mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars
â let me see have i not heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins and of his having had a miraculous escape i forget how but i know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from italy â her ladyship is waiting to receive you gentlemen said the servant who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress with your permission said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars bowing i will precede you to show you the way â by all means replied count_of_monte_cristo i follow you chapter 47 the dappled grays the baron followed by the count traversed a long series of apartments in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth until he reached the boudoir of madame danglarsâ a small octagonal shaped room hung with pink satin covered with white indian muslin the chairs were of ancient workmanship and materials over the door were painted sketches of shepherds and shepherdesses after the style and manner of boucher and at each side pretty medallions in crayons harmonizing well with the furnishings of this charming apartment the only one throughout the great mansion in which any distinctive taste prevailed the truth was it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and his architect who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the day the decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and m_lucien_debray
m mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars however while possessing a great admiration for the antique as it was understood during the time of the directory entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wifeâ favorite sitting room where by the way he was never permitted to intrude unless indeed he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more agreeable visitor than himself and even then he had rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced than that of being the presenter of another his reception being cordial or frigid in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or displease the baroness madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who although past the first bloom of youth was still strikingly handsome was now seated at the piano a most elaborate piece of cabinet and inlaid work while m_lucien_debray standing before a small work table was turning over the pages of an album m_lucien_debray had found time preparatory to the countâ arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars it will be remembered that count_of_monte_cristo had made a lively impression on the mind of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf and although m_lucien_debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count consequently the description given by m_lucien_debray to the baroness bore the highly colored tinge of his own heated imagination already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de viscount_albert_de_morcerf it is no wonder that madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars eagerly listened to and fully credited all the additional circumstances detailed by m_lucien_debray
this posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by way of precaution a most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars the count in return for his gentlemanly bow received a formal though graceful courtesy while m_lucien_debray exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition and with mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars a free and easy nod baroness said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars give me leave to present to you the count_of_monte_cristo who has been most warmly recommended to me by my correspondents at rome i need but mention one fact to make all the ladies in paris court his notice and that is that he has come to take up his abode in paris for a year during which brief period he proposes to spend six millions of money that means balls dinners and lawn parties without end in all of which i trust the count will remember us as he may depend upon it we shall him in our own humble entertainments in spite of the gross flattery and coarseness of this address madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars could not forbear gazing with considerable interest on a man capable of expending six millions in twelve month and who had selected paris for the scene of his princely extravagance and when did you arrive here inquired she yesterday morning madame â coming as usual i presume from the extreme end of the globe pardon meâ at least such i have heard is your custom â nay madame this time i have merely come from cadiz â you have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit paris is a horrible place in summer balls parties and fãªtes are over the italian opera is in london the french opera everywhere except in paris as for the thã atre
franã ais you know of course that it is nowhere the only amusements left us are the indifferent races at the champ de mars and satory do you propose entering any horse at either of these races count â i shall do whatever they do at paris madame if i have the good fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent idea of amusement â are you fond of horse count â i have passed a considerable part of my life in the east madame and you are doubtless aware that the orientals value only two thingsâ the fine breeding of their horse and the beauty of their woman â nay count said the baroness â_it would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies first â you see madame how rightly i spoke when i said i required a preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here at this instant the favorite attendant of madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars entered the boudoir approaching her mistress she spoke some word in an undertone madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars turned very pale then exclaimed i cannot believe it the thing is impossible â i assure you madame replied the woman â_it is as i have said turning impatiently towards her husband madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars demanded is this true â is what true madame inquired mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars visibly agitated what my maid tells me â but what does she tell you â that when my coachman was about to harness the horse to my carriage he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his knowledge i desire to know what is the meaning of this â be kind enough madame to listen to me said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â_oh yes i will listen monsieur_albert for i am most curious to hear what explanation you will give
these two gentlemen shall decide between us but first i will state the case to them gentlemen continued the baroness among the ten horse in the stables of baron mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars are two that belong exclusively to meâ a pair of the handsomest and most spirited creatures to be found in paris but to you at least m_lucien_debray i need not give a further description because to you my beautiful pair of dappled grays were well known well i had promised madame m_noirtier_de_villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the bois but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables they are goneâ positively gone no doubt mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars has sacrificed them to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry franc oh what a detestable crew they are these mercenary speculators â madame replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars the horse were not sufficiently quiet for you they were scarcely four year old and they made me extremely uneasy on your account â nonsense retorted the baroness you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject because you are perfectly well aware that i have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in paris but perhaps you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horse â my dear love pray do not say any more about them and i promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance only more quiet and steady the baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt while her husband affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture turned towards count_of_monte_cristo and said â upon my word count i am quite sorry not to have met you sooner you are setting up an establishment of course â why yes replied the count
â i should have liked to have made you the offer of these horse i have almost given them away as it is but as i before said i was anxious to get rid of them upon any terms they were only fit for a young man â i am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me said count_of_monte_cristo but this morning i purchased a very excellent pair of carriage horse and i do not think they were dear there they are come m_lucien_debray you are a connoisseur i believe let me have your opinion upon them as m_lucien_debray walked towards the window mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars approached his wife i could not tell you before others said he in a low tone the reason of my parting with the horse but a most enormous price was offered me this morning for them some madman or fool bent upon ruining himself as fast as he can actually sent his steward to me to purchase them at any cost and the fact is i have gained 16 000 franc by the sale of them come donâ look so angry and you shall have 000 franc of the money to do what you like with and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars shall have 000 there what do you think now of the affair wasnâ i right to part with the horse madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt great heavens suddenly exclaimed m_lucien_debray what is it asked the baroness i cannot be mistaken there are your horse the very animals we were speaking of harnessed to the countâ carriage â my dappled grays demanded the baroness springing to the window â tis indeed they said she mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars looked absolutely stupefied how very singular cried count_of_monte_cristo with well feigned astonishment i cannot believe it murmured the banker
madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars whispered a few word in the ear of m_lucien_debray who approached count_of_monte_cristo saying the baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horse â i scarcely know replied the count â_it was a little surprise prepared for me by my steward and cost meâ well somewhere about 30 000 franc m_lucien_debray conveyed the countâ reply to the baroness poor mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars looked so crest fallen and discomfited that count_of_monte_cristo assumed a pitying air towards him see said the count how very ungrateful woman are your kind attention in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of the horse does not seem to have made the least impression on her but so it is a woman will often from mere wilfulness prefer that which is dangerous to that which is safe therefore in my opinion my dear baron the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies and allow them to act as they please and then if any mischief follows why at least they have no one to blame but themselves mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars made no reply he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness whose frowning brow like that of olympic jove predicted a storm m_lucien_debray who perceived the gathering clouds and felt no desire to witness the explosion of madame danglarsâ rage suddenly recollected an appointment which compelled him to take his leave while count_of_monte_cristo unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain made a farewell bow and departed leaving mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife 20347m excellent murmured count_of_monte_cristo to himself as he came away all has gone according to my wishes the domestic peace of this family is henceforth in my hand
now then to play another master stroke by which i shall gain the heart of both husband and wifeâ delightful still added he amid all this i have not yet been presented to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars whose acquaintance i should have been glad to make but he went on with his peculiar smile i am here in paris and have plenty of time before meâ by and by will do for that with these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home two hour afterwards madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite dappled grays protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely womanâ regrets the horse were sent back wearing the same harness she had seen on them in the morning only by the countâ order in the centre of each rosette that adorned either side of their head had been fastened a large diamond to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars count_of_monte_cristo also wrote requesting him to excuse the whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire and to beg the baroness to pardon the eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horse during the evening count_of_monte_cristo quitted paris for auteuil accompanied by ali_pasha_of_yanina the following day about three oâ clock a single blow struck on the gong summoned ali_pasha_of_yanina to the presence of the count ali_pasha_of_yanina observed his master as the nubian entered the chamber you have frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in throwing the lasso have you not ali_pasha_of_yanina drew himself up proudly and then returned a sign in the affirmative i thought i did not mistake
with your lasso you could stop an ox again ali_pasha_of_yanina repeated his affirmative gesture or a tiger ali_pasha_of_yanina bowed his head in token of assent a lion even ali_pasha_of_yanina sprung forwards imitating the action of one throwing the lasso then of a strangled lion i understand said count_of_monte_cristo you wish to tell me you have hunted the lion ali_pasha_of_yanina smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many lions but do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horse rushing forwards with ungovernable fury the nubian smiled â_it is well said count_of_monte_cristo then listen to me ere long a carriage will dash past here drawn by the pair of dappled gray horse you saw me with yesterday now at the risk of your own life you must manage to stop those horse before my door ali_pasha_of_yanina descended to the street and marked a straight line on the pavement immediately at the entrance of the house_of_peers and then pointed out the line he had traced to the count who was watching him the count patted him gently on the shoulder his usual mode of praising ali_pasha_of_yanina who pleased and gratified with the commission assigned him walked calmly towards a projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house_of_peers and seating himself thereon began to smoke his chibouque while count_of_monte_cristo re entered his dwelling perfectly assured of the success of his plan still as five oâ clock approached and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his manner
he stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street pacing the chamber with restless step stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels then to cast an anxious glance on ali_pasha_of_yanina but the regularity with which the nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard and almost immediately a carriage appeared drawn by a pair of wild ungovernable horse while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their furious speed in the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight clasped in each otherâ arm terror seemed to have deprived them even of the power of uttering a cry the carriage creaked and rattled as it flew over the rough stones and the slightest obstacle under the wheels would have caused disaster but it kept on in the middle of the road and those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror ali_pasha_of_yanina suddenly cast aside his chibouque drew the lasso from his pocket threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its triple fold and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few step by the violence of the shock then the animal fell over on the pole which snapped and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way gladly availing himself of this opportunity the coachman leaped from his box but ali_pasha_of_yanina had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse and held them in his iron grasp till the beast snorting with pain sunk beside his companion
all this was achieved in much less time than is occupied in the recital the brief space had however been sufficient for a man followed by a number of servant to rush from the house_of_peers before which the accident had occurred and as the coachman opened the door of the carriage to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy who had lost consciousness count_of_monte_cristo carried them both to the salon and deposited them on a sofa compose yourself madame said he all danger is over the woman looked up at these word and with a glance far more expressive than any entreaties could have been pointed to her child who still continued insensible i understand the nature of your alarms madame said the count carefully examining the child but i assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness your little charge has not received the least injury his insensibility is merely the effects of terror and will soon pass â are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears see how deadly pale he is my child my darling edward speak to your motherâ open your dear eye and look on me once again
oh sir in pity send for a physician my whole fortune shall not be thought too much for the recovery of my boy with a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand count_of_monte_cristo signed to the distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions then opening a casket that stood near he drew forth a phial of bohemian glass incrusted with gold containing a liquid of the color of blood of which he let fall a single drop on the childâ lip scarcely had it reached them ere the boy though still pale as marble opened his eye and eagerly gazed around him at this the delight of the mother was almost frantic where am i exclaimed she and to whom am i indebted for so happy a termination to my late dreadful alarm â madame answered the count you are under the roof of one who esteems himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further continuance of your sufferings â my wretched curiosity has brought all this about pursued the lady all paris rung with the praises of madame danglarsâ beautiful horse and i had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them â is it possible exclaimed the count with well feigned astonishment that these horse belong to the baroness â they do indeed may i inquire if you are acquainted with madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars 20351m i have that honor and my happiness at your escape from the danger that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that i have been the unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have incurred
i yesterday purchased these horse of the baron but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them i ventured to send them back to her with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hand â you are then doubtless the count_of_monte_cristo of whom hermine has talked to me so much â you have rightly guessed madame replied the count and i am madame hã loã se m_noirtier_de_villefort the count bowed with the air of a person who hears a name for the first time how grateful will m_noirtier_de_villefort be for all your goodness how thankfully will he acknowledge that to you alone he owes the existence of his wife and child most certainly but for the prompt assistance of your intrepid servant this dear child and myself must both have perished â indeed i still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in â i trust you will allow me to recompense worthily the devotion of your man â i beseech you madame replied count_of_monte_cristo not to spoil ali_pasha_of_yanina either by too great praise or rewards i cannot allow him to acquire the habit of expecting to be recompensed for every trifling service he may render
ali is my slave and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty to me â nay interposed madame m_noirtier_de_villefort on whom the authoritative style adopted by the count made a deep impression nay but consider that to preserve my life he has risked his own â his life madame belongs not to him it is mine in return for my having myself saved him from death madame m_noirtier_de_villefort made no further reply her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the person who from the first instant she saw him had made so powerful an impression on her during the evident preoccupation of madame m_noirtier_de_villefort count_of_monte_cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arm lavishing on him the most tender endearments the child was small for his age and unnaturally pale a mass of straight black hair defying all attempts to train or curl it fell over his projecting forehead and hung down to his shoulders giving increased vivacity to eye already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and fondness for every forbidden enjoyment his mouth was large and the lip which had not yet regained their color were particularly thin in fact the deep and crafty look giving a predominant expression to the childâ face belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young his first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the encircling arm of his mother and to rush forward to the casket from whence the count had taken the phial of elixir then without asking permission of anyone he proceeded in all the wilfulness of a spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices to pull the corks out of all the bottles
â touch nothing my little friend cried the count eagerly some of those liquids are not only dangerous to taste but even to inhale madame m_noirtier_de_villefort became very pale and seizing her sonâ arm drew him anxiously toward her but once satisfied of his safety she also cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket which was not lost upon the count at this moment ali_pasha_of_yanina entered at sight of him madame m_noirtier_de_villefort uttered an expression of pleasure and holding the child still closer towards her she said edward dearest do you see that good man he has shown very great courage and resolution for he exposed his own life to stop the horse that were running away with us and would certainly have dashed the carriage to pieces thank him then my child in your very best manner for had he not come to our aid neither you nor i would have been alive to speak our thanks the child stuck out his lip and turned away his head in a disdainful manner saying heâ too ugly 20353 the count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes while madame m_noirtier_de_villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed this lady said the count speaking to ali_pasha_of_yanina in the arabic language is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their life but the boy refuses saying you are too ugly ali_pasha_of_yanina turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy on whom he gazed without any apparent emotion but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the practiced eye of count_of_monte_cristo that the arab had been wounded to the heart will
you permit me to inquire said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort as she arose to take her leave whether you usually reside here â no i do not replied count_of_monte_cristo â_it is a small place i have purchased quite lately my place of abode is no 30 avenue des champs lysã es but i see you have quite recovered from your fright and are no doubt desirous of returning home anticipating your wishes i have desired the same horse you came with to be put to one of my carriage and ali_pasha_of_yanina he whom you think so very ugly continued he addressing the boy with a smiling air will have the honor of driving you home while your coachman remains here to attend to the necessary repairs of your calash as soon as that important business is concluded i will have a pair of my own horse harnessed to convey it direct to madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â i dare not return with those dreadful horse said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort you will see replied count_of_monte_cristo that they will be as different as possible in the hand of ali_pasha_of_yanina with him they will be gentle and docile as lambs ali_pasha_of_yanina had indeed given proof of this for approaching the animals who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty he rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths
then commencing a loud whistling noise he rubbed them well all over their bodies for several minute then undisturbed by the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage ali_pasha_of_yanina quietly harnessed the pacified animals to the countâ chariot took the reins in his hand and mounted the box when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horse he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated dappled grays now changed into a couple of dull sluggish stupid brutes was a slow pottering pace kept up with so much difficulty that madame m_noirtier_de_villefort was more than two hour returning to her residence in the faubourg saint honorã 20355m scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been gone through when she wrote the following letter to madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â dear hermine i have just had a wonderful escape from the most imminent danger and i owe my safety to the very count_of_monte_cristo we were talking about yesterday but whom i little expected to see today i remember how unmercifully i laughed at what i considered your eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him but i have now ample cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of his merits
your horse got as far as ranelagh when they darted forward like mad thing and galloped away at so fearful a rate that there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor edward but that of being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their progress when a strange looking man an arab a negro or a nubian at least a black of some nation or otherâ at a signal from the count whose domestic he is suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals even at the risk of being trampled to death himself and certainly he must have had a most wonderful escape the count then hastened to us and took us into his house_of_peers where he speedily recalled my poor edward to life he sent us home in his own carriage yours will be returned to you tomorrow you will find your horse in bad condition from the results of this accident they seem thoroughly stupefied as if sulky and vexed at having been conquered by man the count however has commissioned me to assure you that two or three daysâ rest with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time will bring them back to as fine that is as terrifying a condition as they were in yesterday 20356m adieu
i cannot return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday but after all i ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horse more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the count_of_monte_cristo and certainly that illustrious personage apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems i for one delight in solving at any risk even if it were to necessitate another drive to the bois behind your horse edward endured the accident with miraculous courageâ he did not utter a single cry but fell lifeless into my arm nor did a tear fall from his eye after it was over i doubt not you will consider these praises the result of blind maternal affection but there is a soul of iron in that delicate fragile body mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort sends many affectionate remembrances to your dear mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i embrace you with all my heart hã loã se m_noirtier_de_villefort s do pray contrive some means for me to meet the count_of_monte_cristo at your house_of_peers i must and will see him again i have just made m_noirtier_de_villefort promise to call on him and i hope the visit will be returned that night the adventure at auteuil was talked of everywhere monsieur_albert related it to his mother baron_de_chã_teau_renaud recounted it at the jockey club and m_lucien_debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister even m_beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation of the countâ courage and gallantry thereby celebrating him as the greatest hero of the day in the eye of all the feminine members of the aristocracy
vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friend who left their name at the residence of madame m_noirtier_de_villefort with the design of renewing their visit at the right moment of hearing from her lip all the interesting circumstances of this most romantic adventure as for m_noirtier_de_villefort he fulfilled the predictions of hã loã se to the letter donned his dress suit drew on a pair of white gloves ordered the servant to attend the carriage dressed in their full livery and drove that same night to no 30 in the avenue des champs lysã es volume three 30009 30011m chapter 48 ideology if the count_of_monte_cristo had been for a long time familiar with the way of parisian society he would have appreciated better the significance of the step which m_noirtier_de_villefort had taken standing well at court whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch whether the government was doctrinaire liberal or conservative looked upon by all as a man of talent since those who have never experienced a political check are generally so regarded hated by many but warmly supported by others without being really liked by anybody m_noirtier_de_villefort held a high position in the magistracy and maintained his eminence like a harlay or a molã his drawing room under the regenerating influence of a young wife and a daughter by his first marriage scarcely eighteen was still one of the well regulated paris salons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of rigid etiquette were carefully maintained a freezing politeness a strict fidelity to government principles a profound contempt for theories and theorists a deep seated hatred of ideality these were the elements of private and public life displayed by m_noirtier_de_villefort
30023m m_noirtier_de_villefort was not only a magistrate he was almost a diplomatist his relations with the former court of which he always spoke with dignity and respect made him respected by the new one and he knew so many thing that not only was he always carefully considered but sometimes consulted perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to get rid of m_noirtier_de_villefort but like the feudal barons who rebelled against their sovereign he dwelt in an impregnable fortress this fortress was his post as kingâ attorney all the advantages of which he exploited with marvellous skill and which he would not have resigned but to be made deputy and thus to replace neutrality by opposition ordinarily m_noirtier_de_villefort made and returned very few visits his wife visited for him and this was the received thing in the world where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride a manifestation of professed superiorityâ in fact the application of the axiom pretend to think well of yourself and the world will think well of you an axiom a hundred time more useful in society nowadays than that of the greeks know thyself a knowledge for which in our day we have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of knowing others to his friend m_noirtier_de_villefort was a powerful protector to his enemies he was a silent but bitter opponent for those who were neither the one nor the other he was a statue of the law made man he had a haughty bearing a look either steady and impenetrable or insolently piercing and inquisitorial
four successive revolutions had built and cemented the pedestal upon which his fortune was based m_noirtier_de_villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least wearisome man in france he gave a ball every year at which he appeared for a quarter of an hour only that is to say five and forty minute less than the king is visible at his balls he was never seen at the theatres at concerts or in any place of public resort occasionally but seldom he played at whist and then care was taken to select partners worthy of himâ sometimes they were ambassadors sometimes archbishops or sometimes a prince or a president or some dowager duchess such was the man whose carriage had just now stopped before the count of monte cristoâ door the valet de chambre announced m_noirtier_de_villefort at the moment when the count leaning over a large table was tracing on a map the route from st petersburg to china the procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would have employed in entering a court of justice he was the same man or rather the development of the same man whom we have heretofore seen as assistant attorney at marseilles nature according to her way had made no deviation in the path he had marked out for himself from being slender he had now become meagre once pale he was now yellow his deep set eye were hollow and the gold spectacles shielding his eye seemed to be an integral portion of his face
he dressed entirely in black with the exception of his white tie and his funeral appearance was only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through his button hole and appeared like a streak of blood traced with a delicate brush although master of himself count_of_monte_cristo scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned and who distrustful by habit and especially incredulous as to social prodigies was much more despised to look upon the noble stranger as count_of_monte_cristo was already called as an adventurer in search of new fields or an escaped criminal rather than as a prince of the holy see or a sultan of the thousand and one night sir said m_noirtier_de_villefort in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in their oratorical periods and of which they cannot or will not divest themselves in society sir the signal service which you yesterday rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my thanks i have come therefore to discharge this duty and to express to you my overwhelming gratitude and as he said this the eye severeâ of the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual arrogance he spoke in a voice of the procureur general with the rigid inflexibility of neck and shoulders which caused his flatterers to say as we have before observed that he was the living statue of the law
â monsieur_albert replied the count with a chilling air i am very happy to have been the means of preserving a son to his mother for they say that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all and the good fortune which occurred to me monsieur_albert might have enabled you to dispense with a duty which in its discharge confers an undoubtedly great honor for i am aware that m_noirtier_de_villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which he now bestows on me a favor which however estimable is unequal to the satisfaction which i have in my own consciousness m_noirtier_de_villefort astonished at this reply which he by no means expected started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the count_of_monte_cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman he glanced around in order to seize on something on which the conversation might turn and seemed to fall easily on a topic he saw the map which count_of_monte_cristo had been examining when he entered and said you seem geographically engaged sir it is a rich study for you who as i learn have seen as many lands as are delineated on this map â_yes sir replied the count i have sought to make of the human race taken in the mass what you practice every day on individualsâ a physiological study i have believed it was much easier to descend from the whole to a part than to ascend from a part to the whole
it is an algebraic axiom which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity and not from an unknown to a known but sit down sir i beg of you count_of_monte_cristo pointed to a chair which the procureur was obliged to take the trouble to move forwards himself while the count merely fell back into his own on which he had been kneeling when m_noirtier_de_villefort entered thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor having his back towards the window his elbow resting on the geographical chart which furnished the theme of conversation for the moment a conversation which assumed as in the case of the interviews with mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and viscount_albert_de_morcerf a turn analogous to the person if not to the situation ah you philosophize replied m_noirtier_de_villefort after a momentâ silence during which like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent he took breath well sir really if like you i had nothing else to do i should seek a more amusing occupation â why in truth sir was monte cristoâ reply man is but an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope but you said i think that i had nothing else to do now really let me ask sir have you do you believe you have anything to do or to speak in plain terms do you really think that what you do deserves being called anything villefortâ astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly made by his strange adversary it was a long time since the magistrate had heard a paradox so strong or rather to say the truth more exactly it was the first time he had ever heard of it the procureur exerted himself to reply sir
he responded you are a stranger and i believe you say yourself that a portion of your life has been spent in oriental countries so you are not aware how human justice so expeditious in barbarous countries takes with us a prudent and well studied course â_oh yesâ yes i do sir it is the pede claudo of the ancients i know all that for it is with the justice of all countries especially that i have occupied myselfâ it is with the criminal procedure of all nations that i have compared natural justice and i must say sir that it is the law of primitive nations that is the law of retaliation that i have most frequently found to be according to the law of god â if this law were adopted sir said the procureur â_it would greatly simplify our legal codes and in that case the magistrates would not as you just observed have much to do â_it may perhaps come to this in time observed count_of_monte_cristo you know that human inventions march from the complex to the simple and simplicity is always perfection â in the meanwhile continued the magistrate our codes are in full force with all their contradictory enactments derived from gallic customs roman laws and frank usages the knowledge of all which you will agree is not to be acquired without extended labor it needs tedious study to acquire this knowledge and when acquired a strong power of brain to retain it â i agree with you entirely sir but all that even you know with respect to the french code i know not only in reference to that code but as regards the codes of all nations
the english turkish japanese hindu laws are as familiar to me as the french laws and thus i was right when i said to you that relatively you know that everything is relative sir that relatively to what i have done you have very little to do but that relatively to all i have learned you have yet a great deal to learn â but with what motive have you learned all this inquired m_noirtier_de_villefort in astonishment count_of_monte_cristo smiled really sir he observed i see that in spite of the reputation which you have acquired as a superior man you look at everything from the material and vulgar view of society beginning with man and ending with manâ that is to say in the most restricted most narrow view which it is possible for human understanding to embrace â pray sir explain yourself said m_noirtier_de_villefort more and more astonished i really doâ notâ understand youâ perfectly â i say sir that with the eye fixed on the social organization of nations you see only the springs of the machine and lose sight of the sublime workman who makes them act i say that you do not recognize before you and around you any but those office holders whose commissions have been signed by a minister or king and that the man whom god has put above those office holders ministers and kings by giving them a mission to follow out instead of a post to fillâ i say that they escape your narrow limited field of observation it is thus that human weakness fails from its debilitated and imperfect organs tobias took the angel who restored him to light for an ordinary young man
the nations took attila who was doomed to destroy them for a conqueror similar to other conquerors and it was necessary for both to reveal their missions that they might be known and acknowledged one was compelled to say i am the angel of the lordâ and the other i am the hammer of god in order that the divine essence in both might be revealed â then said m_noirtier_de_villefort more and more amazed and really supposing he was speaking to a mystic or a madman you consider yourself as one of those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned â and why not said count_of_monte_cristo coldly your pardon sir replied m_noirtier_de_villefort quite astounded but you will excuse me if when i presented myself to you i was unaware that i should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of man it is not usual with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like yourself possessors as you are of immense fortuneâ at least so it is saidâ and i beg you to observe that i do not inquire i merely repeat â_it is not usual i say for such privileged and wealthy beings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society in philosophical reveries intended at best to console those whom fate has disinherited from the goods of this world â really sir retorted the count have you attained the eminent situation in which you are without having admitted or even without having met with exceptions and do you never use your eye which must have acquired so much finesse and certainty to divine at a glance the kind of man by whom you are confronted
should not a magistrate be not merely the best administrator of the law but the most crafty expounder of the chicanery of his profession a steel probe to search heart a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or less of alloy â sir said m_noirtier_de_villefort upon my word you overcome me i really never heard a person speak as you do â because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general conditions and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper spheres which god has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings â and you allow then sir that spheres exist and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us â why should they not can you see the air you breathe and yet without which you could not for a moment exist â then we do not see those beings to whom you allude â_yes we do you see them whenever god pleases to allow them to assume a material form you touch them come in contact with them speak to them and they reply to you â ah said m_noirtier_de_villefort smiling i confess i should like to be warned when one of these beings is in contact with me â you have been served as you desire monsieur_albert for you were warned just now and i now again warn you â then you yourself are one of these marked beings â_yes monsieur_albert i believe so for until now no man has found himself in a position similar to mine the dominions of kings are limited either by mountains or rivers or a change of manner or an alteration of language
my kingdom is bounded only by the world for i am not an italian or a frenchman or a hindu or an american or a spaniardâ i am a cosmopolite no country can say it saw my birth god alone knows what country will see me die i adopt all customs speak all languages you believe me to be a frenchman for i speak french with the same facility and purity as yourself well ali_pasha_of_yanina my nubian believes me to be an arab monsieur_bertuccio my steward takes me for a roman haydã_e my slave thinks me a greek you may therefore comprehend that being of no country asking no protection from any government acknowledging no man as my brother not one of the scruples that arrest the powerful or the obstacles which paralyze the weak paralyzes or arrests me i have only two adversariesâ i will not say two conquerors for with perseverance i subdue even them they are time and distance there is a third and the most terribleâ that is my condition as a mortal being this alone can stop me in my onward career before i have attained the goal at which i aim for all the rest i have reduced to mathematical terms what man call the chances of fateâ namely ruin change circumstancesâ i have fully anticipated and if any of these should overtake me yet it will not overwhelm me unless i die i shall always be what i am and therefore it is that i utter the thing you have never heard even from the mouths of kingsâ for kings have need and other person have fear of you for who is there who does not say to himself in a society as incongruously organized as ours perhaps some day i shall have to do with the kingâ attorneyâ â but
can you not say that sir the moment you become an inhabitant of france you are naturally subjected to the french law â i know it sir replied count_of_monte_cristo but when i visit a country i begin to study by all the means which are available the man from whom i may have anything to hope or to fear till i know them as well as perhaps better than they know themselves it follows from this that the kingâ attorney be he who he may with whom i should have to deal would assuredly be more embarrassed than i should â that is to say replied m_noirtier_de_villefort with hesitation that human nature being weak every man according to your creed has committed faults â faults or crimes responded count_of_monte_cristo with a negligent air and that you alone amongst the man whom you do not recognize as your brothersâ for you have said so observed m_noirtier_de_villefort in a tone that faltered somewhatâ you alone are perfect â no not perfect was the countâ reply only impenetrable thatâ all but let us leave off this strain sir if the tone of it is displeasing to you i am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my second sight â no no by no means said m_noirtier_de_villefort who was afraid of seeming to abandon his ground no by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level we no longer talk we rise to dissertation but you know how the theologians in their collegiate chairs and philosophers in their controversies occasionally say cruel truths let us suppose for the moment that we are theologizing in a social way or even philosophically and i will say to you rude as it may seem my
brother you sacrifice greatly to pride you may be above others but above you there is god â 30029m above us all sir was monte cristoâ response in a tone and with an emphasis so deep that m_noirtier_de_villefort involuntarily shuddered i have my pride for menâ serpents always ready to threaten everyone who would pass without crushing them under foot but i lay aside that pride before god who has taken me from nothing to make me what i am â then count i admire you said m_noirtier_de_villefort who for the first time in this strange conversation used the aristocratic form to the unknown personage whom until now he had only called monsieur_albert â_yes and i say to you if you are really strong really superior really pious or impenetrable which you were right in saying amounts to the same thingâ then be proud sir for that is the characteristic of predominance yet you have unquestionably some ambition â i have sir â and what may it be â i too as happens to every man once in his life have been taken by satan into the highest mountain in the earth and when there he showed me all the kingdoms of the world and as he said before so said he to me child of earth what wouldst thou have to make thee adore me i reflected long for a gnawing ambition had long preyed upon me and then i replied listen i have always heard of providence and yet i have never seen him or anything that resembles him or which can make me believe that he exists i wish to be providence myself for i feel that the most beautiful noblest most sublime thing in the world is to recompense and punish satan bowed his head and groaned
â you mistake he said providence does exist only you have never seen him because the child of god is as invisible as the parent you have seen nothing that resembles him because he works by secret springs and moves by hidden way all i can do for you is to make you one of the agents of that providence the bargain was concluded i may sacrifice my soul but what matters it added count_of_monte_cristo if the thing were to do again i would again do it m_noirtier_de_villefort looked at count_of_monte_cristo with extreme amazement count he inquired have you any relations â no sir i am alone in the world â so much the worse â why asked count_of_monte_cristo because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down your pride you say you fear nothing but death â i did not say that i feared it i only said that death alone could check the execution of my plans â and old age â my end will be achieved before i grow old â and madness â i have been nearly mad and you know the axiom non bis in idem it is an axiom of criminal law and consequently you understand its full application 30031m sir continued m_noirtier_de_villefort there is something to fear besides death old age and madness for instance there is apoplexyâ that lightning stroke which strikes but does not destroy you and yet which brings everything to an end you are still yourself as now and yet you are yourself no longer you who like ariel verge on the angelic are but an inert mass which like caliban verges on the brutal and this is called in human tongues as i tell you neither more nor less than apoplexy
come if so you will count and continue this conversation at my house_of_peers any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of understanding and anxious to refute you and i will show you my father m_noirtier_de_villefort one of the most fiery jacobins of the french revolution that is to say he had the most remarkable audacity seconded by a most powerful organizationâ a man who has not perhaps like yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth but who has helped to overturn one of the greatest in fact a man who believed himself like you one of the envoys not of god but of a supreme being not of providence but of fate well sir the rupture of a blood vessel on the lobe of the brain has destroyed all this not in a day not in an hour but in a second m_noirtier_de_villefort who on the previous night was the old jacobin the old senator the old carbonaro laughing at the guillotine the cannon and the daggerâ m_noirtier_de_villefort playing with revolutionsâ m_noirtier_de_villefort for whom france was a vast chess board from which pawns rooks knights and queens were to disappear so that the king was checkmatedâ m_noirtier_de_villefort the redoubtable was the next morning poor m_noirtier_de_villefort the helpless old man at the tender mercies of the weakest creature in the household that is his grandchild mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort a dumb and frozen carcass in fact living painlessly on that time may be given for his frame to decompose without his consciousness of its decay â alas sir said count_of_monte_cristo this spectacle is neither strange to my eye nor my thought
i am something of a physician and have like my fellows sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead matter yet like providence it has remained invisible to my eye although present to my heart a hundred writers since socrates seneca st augustine and gall have made in verse and prose the comparison you have made and yet i can well understand that a fatherâ sufferings may effect great changes in the mind of a son i will call on you sir since you bid me contemplate for the advantage of my pride this terrible spectacle which must have been so great a source of sorrow to your family â_it would have been so unquestionably had not god given me so large a compensation in contrast with the old man who is dragging his way to the tomb are two child just entering into lifeâ mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort the daughter by my first wifeâ mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars renã_e de saint mã ranâ and edward the boy whose life you have this day saved â and what is your deduction from this compensation sir inquired count_of_monte_cristo my deduction is replied m_noirtier_de_villefort that my father led away by his passions has committed some fault unknown to human justice but marked by the justice of god that god desirous in his mercy to punish but one person has visited this justice on him alone count_of_monte_cristo with a smile on his lip uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made m_noirtier_de_villefort fly had he but heard it
â adieu sir said the magistrate who had risen from his seat i leave you bearing a remembrance of youâ a remembrance of esteem which i hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better for i am not a man to bore my friend as you will learn besides you have made an eternal friend of madame m_noirtier_de_villefort the count bowed and contented himself with seeing m_noirtier_de_villefort to the door of his cabinet the procureur being escorted to his carriage by two footmen who on a signal from their master followed him with every mark of attention when he had gone count_of_monte_cristo breathed a profound sigh and said enough of this poison let me now seek the antidote then sounding his bell he said to ali_pasha_of_yanina who entered i am going to madameâ chamberâ have the carriage ready at one oâ clock chapter 49 haydã_e it will be recollected that the new or rather old acquaintances of the count_of_monte_cristo residing in the rue meslay were no other than m_maximilian_morrel mademoiselle_julie and m_emmanuel the very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming visitsâ the bright pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged illumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and calmness as immediately after villefortâ departure his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him of tasting at least a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind
even ali_pasha_of_yanina who had hastened to obey the countâ summons went forth from his masterâ presence in charmed amazement at the unusual animation and pleasure depicted on features ordinarily so stern and cold while as though dreading to put to flight the agreeable idea hovering over his patronâ meditations whatever they were the faithful nubian walked on tiptoe towards the door holding his breath lest its faintest sound should dissipate his masterâ happy reverie it was noon and count_of_monte_cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of haydã_e as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy but required a gradual succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations the young greek as we have already said occupied apartments wholly unconnected with those of the count the room had been fitted up in strict accordance with oriental idea the floors were covered with the richest carpets turkey could produce the wall hung with brocaded silk of the most magnificent designs and texture while around each chamber luxurious divans were placed with piles of soft and yielding cushions that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or convenience of such as sought repose haydã_e had three french maids and one who was a greek
the first three remained constantly in a small waiting room ready to obey the summons of a small golden bell or to receive the order of the romaic slave who knew just enough french to be able to transmit her mistressâ wishes to the three other waiting woman the latter had received most peremptory instructions from count_of_monte_cristo to treat haydã_e with all the deference they would observe to a queen the young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her apartments this was a sort of boudoir circular and lighted only from the roof which consisted of rose colored glass haydã_e was reclining upon soft downy cushions covered with blue satin spotted with silver her head supported by one of her exquisitely moulded arm rested on the divan immediately behind her while the other was employed in adjusting to her lip the coral tube of a rich narghile through whose flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by its passage through perfumed water her attitude though perfectly natural for an eastern woman would in a european have been deemed too full of coquettish straining after effect her dress which was that of the woman of epirus consisted of a pair of white satin trousers embroidered with pink roses displaying foot so exquisitely formed and so delicately fair that they might well have been taken for parian marble had not the eye been undeceived by their movements as they constantly shifted in and out of a pair of little slippers with upturned toes beautifully ornamented with gold and pearls
she wore a blue and white striped vest with long open sleeves trimmed with silver loops and buttons of pearls and a sort of bodice which closing only from the centre to the waist exhibited the whole of the ivory throat and upper part of the bosom it was fastened with three magnificent diamond clasps the junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the many colored scarves whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eye of parisian belles tilted on one side of her head she had a small cap of gold colored silk embroidered with pearls while on the other a purple rose mingled its glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair of which the blackness was so intense that it was tinged with blue the extreme beauty of the countenance that shone forth in loveliness that mocked the vain attempts of dress to augment it was peculiarly and purely grecian there were the large dark melting eye the finely formed nose the coral lip and pearly teeth that belonged to her race and country and to complete the whole haydã_e was in the very springtide and fulness of youthful charmsâ she had not yet numbered more than nineteen or twenty summers count_of_monte_cristo summoned the greek attendant and bade her inquire whether it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit haydã eâ only reply was to direct her servant by a sign to withdraw the tapestried curtain that hung before the door of her boudoir the framework of the opening thus made serving as a sort of border to the graceful tableau presented by the young girlâ picturesque attitude and appearance
as count_of_monte_cristo approached she leaned upon the elbow of the arm that held the narghile and extending to him her other hand said with a smile of captivating sweetness in the sonorous language spoken by the woman of athens and sparta why demand permission ere you enter are you no longer my master or have i ceased to be your slave count_of_monte_cristo returned her smile haydã_e said he you well know â why do you address me so coldlyâ so distantly asked the young greek have i by any means displeased you oh if so punish me as you will but do notâ do not speak to me in tone and manner so formal and constrained â haydã_e replied the count you know that you are now in france and are free â free to do what asked the young girl free to leave me â leave you why should i leave you â that is not for me to say but we are now about to mix in societyâ to visit and be visited â i donâ wish to see anybody but you â and should you see one whom you could prefer i would not be so unjustâ â i have never seen anyone i preferred to you and i have never loved anyone but you and my father â my poor child replied count_of_monte_cristo that is merely because your father and myself are the only man who have ever talked to you â i donâ want anybody else to talk to me my father said i was his joyâ you style me your love â and both of you have called me my child â do you remember your father haydã_e the young greek smiled he is here and here said she touching her eye and her heart and where am i inquired count_of_monte_cristo laughingly
â you cried she with tone of thrilling tenderness you are everywhere count_of_monte_cristo took the delicate hand of the young girl in his and was about to raise it to his lip when the simple child of nature hastily withdrew it and presented her cheek you now understand haydã_e said the count that from this moment you are absolutely free that here you exercise unlimited sway and are at liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country as it may suit your inclination within this mansion you are absolute mistress of your actions and may go abroad or remain in your apartments as may seem most agreeable to you a carriage waits your order and ali_pasha_of_yanina and myrtho will accompany you whithersoever you desire to go there is but one favor i would entreat of you â speak â guard carefully the secret of your birth make no allusion to the past nor upon any occasion be induced to pronounce the name of your illustrious father or ill fated mother â i have already told you my lord that i shall see no one â_it is possible haydã_e that so perfect a seclusion though conformable with the habits and customs of the east may not be practicable in paris endeavor then to accustom yourself to our manner of living in these northern climes as you did to those of rome florence milan and madrid it may be useful to you one of these day whether you remain here or return to the east the young girl raised her tearful eye towards count_of_monte_cristo as she said with touching earnestness whether we return to the east you mean to say my lord do you not â my child
returned count_of_monte_cristo you know full well that whenever we part it will be no fault or wish of mine the tree forsakes not the flowerâ the flower falls from the tree â my lord replied haydã_e i never will leave you for i am sure i could not exist without you â my poor girl in ten year i shall be old and you will be still young â my father had a long white beard but i loved him he was sixty year old but to me he was handsomer than all the fine youths i saw â then tell me haydã_e do you believe you shall be able to accustom yourself to our present mode of life â shall i see you â every day â then what do you fear my lord â you might find it dull â no my lord in the morning i shall rejoice in the prospect of your coming and in the evening dwell with delight on the happiness i have enjoyed in your presence then too when alone i can call forth mighty pictures of the past see vast horizons bounded only by the towering mountains of pindus and olympus oh believe me that when three great passions such as sorrow love and gratitude fill the heart ennui can find no place â you are a worthy daughter of epirus haydã_e and your charming and poetical idea prove well your descent from that race of goddesses who claim your country as their birthplace depend on my care to see that your youth is not blighted or suffered to pass away in ungenial solitude and of this be well assured that if you love me as a father i love you as a child â you are wrong my lord
the love i have for you is very different from the love i had for my father my father died but i did not die if you were to die i should die too the count with a smile of profound tenderness extended his hand and she carried it to her lip count_of_monte_cristo thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with m_maximilian_morrel and his family departed murmuring as he went these lines of pindar youth is a flower of which love is the fruit happy is he who after having watched its silent growth is permitted to gather and call it his own the carriage was prepared according to order and stepping lightly into it the count drove off at his usual rapid pace chapter 50 the m_maximilian_morrel family in a very few minute the count reached no in the rue meslay the house_of_peers was of white stone and in a small court before it were two small bed full of beautiful flowers in the concierge that opened the gate the count recognized cocles but as he had but one eye and that eye had become somewhat dim in the course of nine year cocles did not recognize the count the carriage that drove up to the door were compelled to turn to avoid a fountain that played in a basin of rockwork an ornament that had excited the jealousy of the whole quarter and had gained for the place the appellation of the little versailles it is needless to add that there were gold and silver fish in the basin the house_of_peers with kitchens and cellars below had above the ground floor two stories and attics
the whole of the property consisting of an immense workshop two pavilions at the bottom of the garden and the garden itself had been purchased by m_emmanuel who had seen at a glance that he could make of it a profitable speculation he had reserved the house_of_peers and half the garden and building a wall between the garden and the workshops had let them upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the garden so that for a trifling sum he was as well lodged and as perfectly shut out from observation as the inhabitants of the finest mansion in the faubourg st germain the breakfast room was finished in oak the salon in mahogany and the furnishings were of blue velvet the bedroom was in citronwood and green damask there was a study for m_emmanuel who never studied and a music room for mademoiselle_julie who never played the whole of the second story was set apart for m_maximilian_morrel it was precisely similar to his sisterâ apartments except that for the breakfast parlor he had a billiard room where he received his friend he was superintending the grooming of his horse and smoking his cigar at the entrance of the garden when the countâ carriage stopped at the gate cocles opened the gate and monsieur_baptistin springing from the box inquired whether monsieur_albert and madame herbault and monsieur_albert m_maximilian_morrel would see his excellency the count_of_monte_cristo the count_of_monte_cristo cried m_maximilian_morrel throwing away his cigar and hastening to the carriage i should think we would see him
ah a thousand thanks count for not having forgotten your promise and the young officer shook the countâ hand so warmly that count_of_monte_cristo could not be mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy and he saw that he had been expected with impatience and was received with pleasure come come said m_maximilian_morrel i will serve as your guide such a man as you are ought not to be introduced by a servant my sister is in the garden plucking the dead roses my brother is reading his two paper la presse and les dã bats within six step of her for wherever you see madame herbault you have only to look within a circle of four yards and you will find m_emmanuel and reciprocally as they say at the polytechnic school at the sound of their step a young woman of twenty to five and twenty dressed in a silk morning gown and busily engaged in plucking the dead leaves off a noisette rose tree raised her head this was mademoiselle_julie who had become as the clerk of the house_of_peers of thomson_french_of_rome had predicted madame m_emmanuel herbault she uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of a stranger and m_maximilian_morrel began to laugh donâ disturb yourself mademoiselle_julie said he the count has only been two or three day in paris but he already knows what a fashionable woman of the marais is and if he does not you will show him â ah monsieur_albert returned mademoiselle_julie â_it is treason in my brother to bring you thus but he never has any regard for his poor sister
penelon penelon an old man who was digging busily at one of the bed stuck his spade in the earth and approached cap in hand striving to conceal a quid of tobacco he had just thrust into his cheek a few locks of gray mingled with his hair which was still thick and matted while his bronzed features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who had braved the heat of the equator and the storms of the tropics i think you hailed me mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_julie said he penelon had still preserved the habit of calling his masterâ daughter mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_julie and had never been able to change the name to madame herbault penelon replied mademoiselle_julie go and inform m_emmanuel of this gentlemanâ visit and m_maximilian_morrel will conduct him to the salon then turning to count_of_monte_cristo â i hope you will permit me to leave you for a few minute continued she and without awaiting any reply disappeared behind a clump of trees and escaped to the house_of_peers by a lateral alley 30041m i am sorry to see observed count_of_monte_cristo to m_maximilian_morrel that i cause no small disturbance in your house_of_peers â look there said m_maximilian_morrel laughing there is her husband changing his jacket for a coat i assure you you are well known in the rue meslay â your family appears to be a very happy one said the count as if speaking to himself â_oh yes i assure you count they want nothing that can render them happy they are young and cheerful they are tenderly attached to each other and with twenty five thousand franc a year they fancy themselves as rich as rothschild
â five and twenty thousand franc is not a large sum however replied count_of_monte_cristo with a tone so sweet and gentle that it went to maximilianâ heart like the voice of a father but they will not be content with that your brother in law is a barrister a doctor â he was a merchant monsieur_albert and had succeeded to the business of my poor father m_maximilian_morrel at his death left 500 000 franc which were divided between my sister and myself for we were his only child her husband who when he married her had no other patrimony than his noble probity his first rate ability and his spotless reputation wished to possess as much as his wife he labored and toiled until he had amassed 250 000 franc six year sufficed to achieve this object oh i assure you sir it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures destined by their talents for higher stations toiling together and through their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their paternal house_of_peers taking six year to accomplish what less scrupulous people would have effected in two or three marseilles resounded with their well earned praises at last one day m_emmanuel came to his wife who had just finished making up the accounts â mademoiselle_julie said he to her cocles has just given me the last rouleau of a hundred franc that completes the 250 000 franc we had fixed as the limits of our gains can you content yourself with the small fortune which we shall possess for the future listen to me our house_of_peers transacts business to the amount of a million a year from which we derive an income of 40 000 franc
we can dispose of the business if we please in an hour for i have received a letter from delaunay in which he offers to purchase the good will of the house_of_peers to unite with his own for 300 000 franc advise me what i had better do â m_emmanuel returned my sister the house_of_peers of m_maximilian_morrel can only be carried on by a m_maximilian_morrel is it not worth 300 000 franc to save our fatherâ name from the chances of evil fortune and failure â i thought so replied m_emmanuel but i wished to have your advice â this is my counsel our accounts are made up and our bills paid all we have to do is to stop the issue of any more and close our office â this was done instantly it was three oâ clock at a quarter past a merchant presented himself to insure two ships it was a clear profit of 15 000 franc â monsieur_albert said m_emmanuel have the goodness to address yourself to delaunay we have quitted business â how long inquired the astonished merchant 30043m â a quarter of an hour was the reply and this is the reason monsieur_albert continued m_maximilian_morrel of my sister and brother in law having only 25 000 franc a year m_maximilian_morrel had scarcely finished his story during which the countâ heart had swelled within him when m_emmanuel entered wearing a hat and coat he saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the rank of his guest then after having led count_of_monte_cristo around the little garden he returned to the house_of_peers a large vase of japan porcelain filled with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume stood in the salon
julie suitably dressed and her hair arranged she had accomplished this feat in less than ten minute received the count on his entrance the songs of the birds were heard in an aviary hard by and the branches of laburnums and rose acacias formed an exquisite framework to the blue velvet curtains everything in this charming retreat from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress breathed tranquillity and repose the count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house_of_peers and he remained silent and pensive forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation which had ceased after the first salutations had been exchanged the silence became almost painful when by a violent effort tearing himself from his pleasing reverie madame said he at length i pray you to excuse my emotion which must astonish you who are only accustomed to the happiness i meet here but contentment is so new a sight to me that i could never be weary of looking at yourself and your husband â we are very happy monsieur_albert replied mademoiselle_julie but we have also known unhappiness and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than ourselves the countâ features displayed an expression of the most intense curiosity â_oh all this is a family history as baron_de_chã_teau_renaud told you the other day observed m_maximilian_morrel this humble picture would have but little interest for you accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious but such as we are we have experienced bitter sorrows â and god has poured balm into your wounds as he does into those of all who are in affliction said count_of_monte_cristo inquiringly
â yes count returned mademoiselle_julie we may indeed say he has for he has done for us what he grants only to his chosen he sent us one of his angels the countâ cheeks became scarlet and he coughed in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth those born to wealth and who have the means of gratifying every wish said m_emmanuel know not what is the real happiness of life just as those who have been tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair weather count_of_monte_cristo rose and without making any answer for the tremulousness of his voice would have betrayed his emotion walked up and down the apartment with a slow step our magnificence makes you smile count said m_maximilian_morrel who had followed him with his eye no no returned count_of_monte_cristo pale as death pressing one hand on his heart to still its throbbings while with the other he pointed to a crystal cover beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet cushion i was wondering what could be the significance of this purse with the paper at one end and the large diamond at the other â count replied m_maximilian_morrel with an air of gravity those are our most precious family treasures â the stone seems very brilliant answered the count â_oh my brother does not allude to its value although it has been estimated at 100 000 franc he means that the articles contained in this purse are the relics of the angel i spoke of just now â this i do not comprehend and yet i may not ask for an explanation madame replied count_of_monte_cristo bowing pardon
me i had no intention of committing an indiscretion â indiscretion â_oh you make us happy by giving us an excuse for expatiating on this subject if we wanted to conceal the noble action this purse commemorates we should not expose it thus to view oh would we could relate it everywhere and to everyone so that the emotion of our unknown benefactor might reveal his presence â ah really said count_of_monte_cristo in a half stifled voice monsieur_albert returned m_maximilian_morrel raising the glass cover and respectfully kissing the silken purse this has touched the hand of a man who saved my father from suicide us from ruin and our name from shame and disgrace a man by whose matchless benevolence we poor child doomed to want and wretchedness can at present hear everyone envying our happy lot this letterâ as he spoke m_maximilian_morrel drew a letter from the purse and gave it to the count â this letter was written by him the day that my father had taken a desperate resolution and this diamond was given by the generous unknown to my sister as her dowry count_of_monte_cristo opened the letter and read it with an indescribable feeling of delight it was the letter written as our readers know to mademoiselle_julie and signed sinbad the sailor â unknown you say is the man who rendered you this serviceâ unknown to you â_yes we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand continued m_maximilian_morrel
â we have supplicated heaven in vain to grant us this favor but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we cannot comprehendâ we have been guided by an invisible hand a hand as powerful as that of an enchanter â_oh cried mademoiselle_julie i have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand as i now kiss the purse which he has touched four year ago penelon was at triesteâ penelon count is the old sailor you saw in the garden and who from quartermaster has become gardenerâ penelon when he was at trieste saw on the quay an englishman who was on the point of embarking on board a yacht and he recognized him as the person who called on my father the fifth of june 1829 and who wrote me this letter on the fifth of september he felt convinced of his identity but he did not venture to address him â an englishman said count_of_monte_cristo who grew uneasy at the attention with which mademoiselle_julie looked at him an englishman you say â_yes replied m_maximilian_morrel an englishman who represented himself as the confidential clerk of the house_of_peers of thomson_french_of_rome at rome it was this that made me start when you said the other day at de morcerfâ that messrs thomson_french_of_rome were your bankers that happened as i told you in 1829 for godâ sake tell me did you know this englishman â but you tell me also that the house_of_peers of thomson_french_of_rome have constantly denied having rendered you this service
â yes â then is it not probable that this englishman may be someone who grateful for a kindness your father had shown him and which he himself had forgotten has taken this method of requiting the obligation â everything is possible in this affair even a miracle â what was his name asked count_of_monte_cristo he gave no other name answered mademoiselle_julie looking earnestly at the count than that at the end of his letterâ sinbad the sailor â which is evidently not his real name but a fictitious one then noticing that mademoiselle_julie was struck with the sound of his voice tell me continued he was he not about my height perhaps a little taller with his chin imprisoned as it were in a high cravat his coat closely buttoned up and constantly taking out his pencil â_oh do you then know him cried mademoiselle_julie whose eye sparkled with joy no returned count_of_monte_cristo i only guessed i knew a lord_wilmore who was constantly doing actions of this kind â without revealing himself â he was an eccentric being and did not believe in the existence of gratitude â_oh heaven exclaimed mademoiselle_julie clasping her hand in what did he believe then 30047m he did not credit it at the period which i knew him said count_of_monte_cristo touched to the heart by the accents of julieâ voice but perhaps since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist â and do you know this gentleman monsieur_albert inquired m_emmanuel â_oh if you do know him cried mademoiselle_julie can you tell us where he isâ where we can find him maximilianâ emmanuelâ if we do but discover him he must believe in the gratitude of the heart count_of_monte_cristo felt tears start into his eye and he again walked hastily up and down the room in
the name of heaven said m_maximilian_morrel if you know anything of him tell us what it is â alas cried count_of_monte_cristo striving to repress his emotion if lord_wilmore was your unknown benefactor i fear you will never see him again i parted from him two year ago at palermo and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions so that i fear he will never return â_oh monsieur_albert this is cruel of you said mademoiselle_julie much affected and the young ladyâ eye swam with tears madame replied count_of_monte_cristo gravely and gazing earnestly on the two liquid pearls that trickled down julieâ cheeks had lord_wilmore seen what i now see he would become attached to life for the tears you shed would reconcile him to mankind and he held out his hand to mademoiselle_julie who gave him hers carried away by the look and accent of the count but continued she lord_wilmore had a family or friend he must have known someone can we notâ â â_oh it is useless to inquire returned the count perhaps after all he was not the man you seek for he was my friend he had no secrets from me and if this had been so he would have confided in me â and he told you nothing â not a word â nothing that would lead you to suppose â nothing â and yet you spoke of him at once â ah in such a case one supposesâ â sister sister said m_maximilian_morrel coming to the countâ aid monsieur_albert is quite right recollect what our excellent father so often told us â_it was no englishman that thus saved us â count_of_monte_cristo started what did your father tell you m_maximilian_morrel said he eagerly my
father thought that this action had been miraculously performedâ he believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us oh it was a touching superstition monsieur_albert and although i did not myself believe it i would not for the world have destroyed my fatherâ faith how often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear friendâ a friend lost to him forever and on his death bed when the near approach of eternity seemed to have illumined his mind with supernatural light this thought which had until then been but a doubt became a conviction and his last word were m_maximilian_morrel it was edmond_dantã_s â at these word the countâ paleness which had for some time been increasing became alarming he could not speak he looked at his watch like a man who has forgotten the hour said a few hurried word to madame herbault and pressing the hand of m_emmanuel and m_maximilian_morrel â madame said he i trust you will allow me to visit you occasionally i value your friendship and feel grateful to you for your welcome for this is the first time for many year that i have thus yielded to my feelings and he hastily quitted the apartment this count_of_monte_cristo is a strange man said m_emmanuel â_yes answered m_maximilian_morrel but i feel sure he has an excellent heart and that he likes us â his voice went to my heart observed mademoiselle_julie and two or three time i fancied that i had heard it before chapter 51
pyramus and thisbe about two thirds of the way along the faubourg saint honorã and in the rear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood where the various house vie with each other for elegance of design and magnificence of construction extended a large garden where the wide spreading chestnut trees raised their head high above the wall in a solid rampart and with the coming of every spring scattered a shower of delicate pink and white blossoms into the large stone vases that stood upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron gate that dated from the time of louis_xviii xiii this noble entrance however in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom had fallen into utter disuse the proprietors of the mansion had many year before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house_of_peers itself with its thickly planted courtyard opening into the faubourg saint honorã and to the garden shut in by this gate which formerly communicated with a fine kitchen garden of about an acre for the demon of speculation drew a line or in other word projected a street at the farther side of the kitchen garden the street was laid out a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate but before construction was begun it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables by building along the line of the proposed street and so making it a branch of communication with the faubourg saint honorã itself one of the most important thoroughfares in the city of paris
in matters of speculation however though man proposes yet money disposes from some such difficulty the newly named street died almost in birth and the purchaser of the kitchen garden having paid a high price for it and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his bargain off his hand without a considerable loss yet still clinging to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that would repay him not only for his past outlay but also the interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition contented himself with letting the ground temporarily to some market gardeners at a yearly rental of 500 franc and so as we have said the iron gate leading into the kitchen garden had been closed up and left to the rust which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers and delvers of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion the gate had been boarded up to a height of six foot true the planks were not so closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house_of_peers left no grounds for apprehending that advantage would be taken of that circumstance horticulture seemed however to have been abandoned in the deserted kitchen garden and where cabbages carrots radishes peas and melons had once flourished a scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its being deemed worthy of cultivation
a small low door gave egress from the walled space we have been describing into the projected street the ground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters and had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not even the one half per cent it had originally paid towards the house_of_peers the chestnut trees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces as though asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air at one corner where the foliage became so thick as almost to shut out day a large stone bench and sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered spot was either in general favor or particular use by some inhabitant of the house_of_peers which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of verdure that partially concealed it though situated but a hundred paces off whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of a walk or as a place for meditation was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare the cool refreshing shade the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun that found no entrance there even during the burning day of hottest summer the incessant and melodious warbling of birds and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion
on the evening of one of the warmest day spring had yet bestowed on the inhabitants of paris might be seen negligently thrown upon the stone bench a book a parasol and a work basket from which hung a partly embroidered cambric handkerchief while at a little distance from these articles was a young woman standing close to the iron gate endeavoring to discern something on the other side by means of the openings in the planks the earnestness of her attitude and the fixed gaze with which she seemed to seek the object of her wishes proving how much her feelings were interested in the matter at that instant the little side gate leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly opened and a tall powerful young man appeared he was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap but his carefully arranged hair beard and moustache all of the richest and glossiest black ill accorded with his plebeian attire after casting a rapid glance around him in order to assure himself that he was unobserved he entered by the small gate and carefully closing and securing it after him proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier at the sight of him she expected though probably not in such a costume the young woman started in terror and was about to make a hasty retreat but the eye of love had already seen even through the narrow chinks of the wooden palisades the movement of the white robe and observed the fluttering of the blue sash pressing his lip close to the planks he exclaimed donâ be alarmed valentineâ it is i again the timid girl found courage to return to the gate saying as she did so and why do you come so late today
it is almost dinner time and i had to use no little diplomacy to get rid of my watchful mother in law my too devoted maid and my troublesome brother who is always teasing me about coming to work at my embroidery which i am in a fair way never to get done so pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made me wait and after that tell me why i see you in a dress so singular that at first i did not recognize you â dearest mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said the young man the difference between our respective stations makes me fear to offend you by speaking of my love but yet i cannot find myself in your presence without longing to pour forth my soul and tell you how fondly i adore you if it be but to carry away with me the recollection of such sweet moment i could even thank you for chiding me for it leaves me a gleam of hope that if you did not expect me and that indeed would be worse than vanity to suppose at least i was in your thoughts you asked me the cause of my being late and why i come disguised i will candidly explain the reason of both and i trust to your goodness to pardon me i have chosen a trade â a trade oh m_maximilian_morrel how can you jest at a time when we have such deep cause for uneasiness â heaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than life itself but listen to me mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and i will tell you all about it
i became weary of ranging fields and scaling wall and seriously alarmed at the idea suggested by you that if caught hovering about here your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief that would compromise the honor of the french army to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of spahis in a place where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise so i have become a gardener and consequently adopted the costume of my calling â what excessive nonsense you talk m_maximilian_morrel â nonsense pray do not call what i consider the wisest action of my life by such a name consider by becoming a gardener i effectually screen our meetings from all suspicion or danger 30053m i beseech of you m_maximilian_morrel to cease trifling and tell me what you really mean â simply that having ascertained that the piece of ground on which i stand was to let i made application for it was readily accepted by the proprietor and am now master of this fine crop of lucern think of that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort there is nothing now to prevent my building myself a little hut on my plantation and residing not twenty yards from you only imagine what happiness that would afford me i can scarcely contain myself at the bare idea such felicity seems above all priceâ as a thing impossible and unattainable but would you believe that i purchase all this delight joy and happiness for which i would cheerfully have surrendered ten year of my life at the small cost of 500 franc per annum paid quarterly henceforth we have nothing to fear
i am on my own ground and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the wall and to look over when i please without having any apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character i may also enjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of my fond faithful and unalterable affection whenever you visit your favorite bower unless indeed it offends your pride to listen to professions of love from the lip of a poor workingman clad in a blouse and cap a faint cry of mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lip of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort who almost instantly said in a saddened tone as though some envious cloud darkened the joy which illumined her heart alas no m_maximilian_morrel this must not be for many reasons we should presume too much on our own strength and like others perhaps be led astray by our blind confidence in each otherâ prudence â how can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought dear mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort have i not from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance schooled all my word and actions to your sentiments and idea and you have i am sure the fullest confidence in my honor when you spoke to me of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger i placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service asking no other reward than the pleasure of being useful to you and have i ever since by word or look given you cause of regret for having selected me from the numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their life for you
you told me my dear mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort that you were engaged to dâ pinay and that your father was resolved upon completing the match and that from his will there was no appeal as m_noirtier_de_villefort was never known to change a determination once formed i kept in the background as you wished and waited not for the decision of your heart or my own but hoping that providence would graciously interpose in our behalf and order events in our favor but what cared i for delays or difficulties mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort as long as you confessed that you loved me and took pity on me if you will only repeat that avowal now and then i can endure anything â ah m_maximilian_morrel that is the very thing that makes you so bold and which renders me at once so happy and unhappy that i frequently ask myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my mother in law and her blind preference for her own child or to be as i now am insensible to any pleasure save such as i find in these meetings so fraught with danger to both â i will not admit that word returned the young man â_it is at once cruel and unjust is it possible to find a more submissive slave than myself you have permitted me to converse with you from time to time mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or elsewhereâ have i not obeyed and since i found means to enter this enclosure to exchange a few word with you through this gateâ to be close to you without really seeing youâ have
i ever asked so much as to touch the hem of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but a trifle to one of my youth and strength never has a complaint or a murmur escaped me i have been bound by my promises as rigidly as any knight of olden time come come dearest mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort confess that what i say is true lest i be tempted to call you unjust 30055m â_it is true said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort as she passed the end of her slender fingers through a small opening in the planks and permitted m_maximilian_morrel to press his lip to them and you are a true and faithful friend but still you acted from motives of self interest my dear m_maximilian_morrel for you well knew that from the moment in which you had manifested an opposite spirit all would have been ended between us you promised to bestow on me the friendly affection of a brother for i have no friend but yourself upon earth who am neglected and forgotten by my father harassed and persecuted by my mother in law and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man whose withered hand can no longer press mine and who can speak to me with the eye alone although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor grandchild oh how bitter a fate is mine to serve either as a victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself while my only friend and supporter is a living corpse indeed indeed m_maximilian_morrel i am very miserable and if you love me it must be out of pity â mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort replied
the young man deeply affected i will not say you are all i love in the world for i dearly prize my sister and brother in law but my affection for them is calm and tranquil in no manner resembling what i feel for you when i think of you my heart beats fast the blood burns in my veins and i can hardly breathe but i solemnly promise you to restrain all this ardor this fervor and intensity of feeling until you yourself shall require me to render them available in serving or assisting you m_franz_de_quesnel is not expected to return home for a year to come i am told in that time many favorable and unforeseen chances may befriend us let us then hope for the best hope is so sweet a comforter meanwhile mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort while reproaching me with selfishness think a little what you have been to meâ the beautiful but cold resemblance of a marble venus what promise of future reward have you made me for all the submission and obedience i have evinced none whatever what granted me scarcely more you tell me of m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay your betrothed lover and you shrink from the idea of being his wife but tell me mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort is there no other sorrow in your heart you see me devoted to you body and soul my life and each warm drop that circles round my heart are consecrated to your service you know full well that my existence is bound up in yoursâ that were i to lose you i would not outlive the hour of such crushing misery yet you speak with calmness of the prospect of your being the wife of another
oh mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort were i in your place and did i feel conscious as you do of being worshipped adored with such a love as mine a hundred time at least should i have passed my hand between these iron bars and said take this hand dearest m_maximilian_morrel and believe that living or dead i am yoursâ yours only and forever â the poor girl made no reply but her lover could plainly hear her sobs and tears a rapid change took place in the young manâ feelings dearest dearest mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort exclaimed he forgive me if i have offended you and forget the word i spoke if they have unwittingly caused you pain â no m_maximilian_morrel i am not offended answered she but do you not see what a poor helpless being i am almost a stranger and an outcast in my fatherâ house_of_peers where even he is seldom seen whose will has been thwarted and spirits broken from the age of ten year beneath the iron rod so sternly held over me oppressed mortified and persecuted day by day hour by hour minute by minute no person has cared for even observed my sufferings nor have i ever breathed one word on the subject save to yourself outwardly and in the eye of the world i am surrounded by kindness and affection but the reverse is the case the general remark is â_oh it cannot be expected that one of so stern a character as m_noirtier_de_villefort could lavish the tenderness some father do on their daughter what though she has lost her own mother at a tender age she has had the happiness to find a second mother in madame m_noirtier_de_villefort
the world however is mistaken my father abandons me from utter indifference while my mother in law detests me with a hatred so much the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile â hate you sweet mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort exclaimed the young man how is it possible for anyone to do that â alas replied the weeping girl i am obliged to own that my mother in lawâ aversion to me arises from a very natural sourceâ her overweening love for her own child my brother edward â but why should it â i do not know but though unwilling to introduce money matters into our present conversation i will just say this muchâ that her extreme dislike to me has its origin there and i much fear she envies me the fortune i enjoy in right of my mother and which will be more than doubled at the death of and mme de madame_de_saint_mã_ran whose sole heiress i am madame m_noirtier_de_villefort has nothing of her own and hates me for being so richly endowed alas how gladly would i exchange the half of this wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my fatherâ love god knows i would prefer sacrificing the whole so that it would obtain me a happy and affectionate home â poor mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â i seem to myself as though living a life of bondage yet at the same time am so conscious of my own weakness that i fear to break the restraint in which i am held lest i fall utterly helpless
then too my father is not a person whose order may be infringed with impunity protected as he is by his high position and firmly established reputation for talent and unswerving integrity no one could oppose him he is all powerful even with the king he would crush you at a word dear m_maximilian_morrel believe me when i assure you that if i do not attempt to resist my fatherâ commands it is more on your account than my own â but why mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort do you persist in anticipating the worst why picture so gloomy a future â because i judge it from the past â still consider that although i may not be strictly speaking what is termed an illustrious match for you i am for many reasons not altogether so much beneath your alliance the day when such distinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in france and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with those of the empire the aristocracy of the lance has allied itself with the nobility of the cannon now i belong to this last named class and certainly my prospects of military preferment are most encouraging as well as certain my fortune though small is free and unfettered and the memory of my late father is respected in our country mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort as that of the most upright and honorable merchant of the city i say our country because you were born not far from marseilles â donâ speak of marseilles i beg of you m_maximilian_morrel that one word brings back my mother to my recollectionâ my angel mother who died too soon for myself and all who knew her but who after watching over her child during the brief period allotted to her in this world now i fondly hope watches from her home in heaven
oh if my mother were still living there would be nothing to fear m_maximilian_morrel for i would tell her that i loved you and she would protect us â i fear mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort replied the lover that were she living i should never have had the happiness of knowing you you would then have been too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me â now it is you who are unjust m_maximilian_morrel cried mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort but there is one thing i wish to know â and what is that inquired the young man perceiving that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort hesitated tell me truly m_maximilian_morrel whether in former day when our father dwelt at marseilles there was ever any misunderstanding between them â not that i am aware of replied the young man unless indeed any ill feeling might have arisen from their being of opposite partiesâ your father was as you know a zealous partisan of the bourbons while mine was wholly devoted to the emperor there could not possibly be any other difference between them but why do you ask â i will tell you replied the young girl for it is but right you should know well on the day when your appointment as an officer of the legion of honor was announced in the paper we were all sitting with my grandfather m_noirtier_de_villefort mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was there alsoâ you recollect mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars do you not m_maximilian_morrel the banker whose horse ran away with my mother in law and little brother and very nearly killed them
while the rest of the company were discussing the approaching marriage of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i was reading the paper to my grandfather but when i came to the paragraph about you although i had done nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning you know you had told me all about it the previous evening i felt so happy and yet so nervous at the idea of speaking your name aloud and before so many people that i really think i should have passed it over but for the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence so i summoned up all my courage and read it as firmly and as steadily as i could 30059m dear mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â well would you believe it directly my father caught the sound of your name he turned round quite hastily and like a poor silly thing i was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by the utterance of your name that i was not surprised to see my father start and almost tremble but i even thought though that surely must have been a mistake that mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars trembled too â m_maximilian_morrel morrel cried my father stop a bit then knitting his brows into a deep frown he added surely this cannot be one of the m_maximilian_morrel family who lived at marseilles and gave us so much trouble from their violent bonapartismâ i mean about the year 1815 â â_yes replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i believe he is the son of the old shipowner â indeed answered m_maximilian_morrel and what did your father say then mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â_oh such a dreadful thing that i donâ dare to tell you â always tell me everything said m_maximilian_morrel with a smile
â ah continued my father still frowning their idolized emperor treated these madmen as they deserved he called them food for cannon which was precisely all they were good for and i am delighted to see that the present government have adopted this salutary principle with all its pristine vigor if algiers were good for nothing but to furnish the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice it would be an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain though it certainly does cost france somewhat dear to assert her rights in that uncivilized country â brutal politics i must confess said m_maximilian_morrel but donâ attach any serious importance dear to what your father said my father was not a bit behind yours in that sort of talk why said he does not the emperor who has devised so many clever and efficient modes of improving the art of war organize a regiment of lawyers judges and legal practitioners sending them in the hottest fire the enemy could maintain and using them to save better man you see my dear that for picturesque expression and generosity of spirit there is not much to choose between the language of either party but what did mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur â_oh he laughed and in that singular manner so peculiar to himselfâ half malicious half ferocious he almost immediately got up and took his leave then for the first time i observed the agitation of my grandfather and i must tell you m_maximilian_morrel that i am the only person capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame
and i suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man without the smallest regard for his feelings had made a strong impression on his mind for naturally enough it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating manner â the name of m_noirtier_de_villefort interposed m_maximilian_morrel is celebrated throughout europe he was a statesman of high standing and you may or may not know mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort that he took a leading part in every bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the bourbons â_oh i have often heard whispers of thing that seem to me most strangeâ the father a bonapartist the son a royalist what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics but to resume my story i turned towards my grandfather as though to question him as to the cause of his emotion he looked expressively at the newspaper i had been reading what is the matter dear grandfather said i are you pleased he gave me a sign in the affirmative with what my father said just now he returned a sign in the negative perhaps you liked what mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars said another sign in the negative â_oh then you were glad to hear that m_maximilian_morrel i didnâ dare to say m_maximilian_morrel had been made an officer of the legion of honor he signified assent only think of the poor old manâ being so pleased to think that you who were a perfect stranger to him had been made an officer of the legion of honor
perhaps it was a mere whim on his part for he is falling they say into second childhood but i love him for showing so much interest in you â how singular murmured m_maximilian_morrel your father hates me while your grandfather on the contraryâ what strange feelings are aroused by politics â hush cried mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort suddenly someone is coming m_maximilian_morrel leaped at one bound into his crop of lucern which he began to pull up in the most ruthless way under the pretext of being occupied in weeding it mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort exclaimed a voice from behind the trees madame is searching for you everywhere there is a visitor in the drawing room â a visitor inquired mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort much agitated who is it â some grand personageâ a prince i believe they saidâ the count_of_monte_cristo â i will come directly cried mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort aloud the name of count_of_monte_cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the iron gate to whom valentineâ â i am comingâ was the customary signal of farewell now then said m_maximilian_morrel leaning on the handle of his spade i would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the count_of_monte_cristo is acquainted with m_noirtier_de_villefort chapter 52 toxicology it was really the count_of_monte_cristo who had just arrived at madame de villefortâ for the purpose of returning the procureurâ visit and at his name as may be easily imagined the whole house_of_peers was in confusion
madame m_noirtier_de_villefort who was alone in her drawing room when the count was announced desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count and edward who heard this great personage talked of for two whole day made all possible haste to come to him not from obedience to his mother or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count but from sheer curiosity and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say â_oh that naughty child but i canâ be severe with him he is really so bright after the usual civilities the count inquired after m_noirtier_de_villefort my husband dines with the chancellor replied the young lady he has just gone and i am sure heâ ll be exceedingly sorry not to have had the pleasure of seeing you before he went two visitors who were there when the count arrived having gazed at him with all their eye retired after that reasonable delay which politeness admits and curiosity requires what is your sister mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort doing inquired madame m_noirtier_de_villefort of edward tell someone to bid her come here that i may have the honor of introducing her to the count â you have a daughter then madame inquired the count very young i presume â the daughter of m_noirtier_de_villefort by his first marriage replied the young wife a fine well grown girl â but melancholy interrupted master edward snatching the feathers out of the tail of a splendid paroquet that was screaming on its gilded perch in order to make a plume for his hat
madame m_noirtier_de_villefort merely cried be still edward she then added this young madcap is however very nearly right and merely re echoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred time for mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort is in spite of all we can do to rouse her of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit which frequently injure the effect of her beauty but what detains her go edward and see â because they are looking for her where she is not to be found â and where are they looking for her â with grandpapa m_noirtier_de_villefort â and do you think she is not there â no no no no no she is not there replied edward singing his word and where is she then if you know why donâ you tell â she is under the big chestnut tree replied the spoiled brat as he gave in spite of his motherâ commands live flies to the parrot which seemed keenly to relish such fare madame m_noirtier_de_villefort stretched out her hand to ring intending to direct her waiting maid to the spot where she would find mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort when the young lady herself entered the apartment she appeared much dejected and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eye mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort whom we have in the rapid march of our narrative presented to our readers without formally introducing her was a tall and graceful girl of nineteen with bright chestnut hair deep blue eye and that reposeful air of quiet distinction which characterized her mother her white and slender fingers her pearly neck her cheeks tinted with varying hues reminded one of the lovely englishwomen who have been so poetically compared in their manner to the gracefulness of a swan
she entered the apartment and seeing near her stepmother the stranger of whom she had already heard so much saluted him without any girlish awkwardness or even lowering her eye and with an elegance that redoubled the countâ attention he rose to return the salutation mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort my step daughter said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort to count_of_monte_cristo leaning back on her sofa and motioning towards mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort with her hand and de count_of_monte_cristo king of china emperor of cochin china said the young imp looking slyly towards his sister madame m_noirtier_de_villefort at this really did turn pale and was very nearly angry with this household plague who answered to the name of edward but the count on the contrary smiled and appeared to look at the boy complacently which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and enthusiasm but madame replied the count continuing the conversation and looking by turns at madame m_noirtier_de_villefort and mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort have i not already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars before i could not help thinking so just now the idea came over my mind and as mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars entered the sight of her was an additional ray of light thrown on a confused remembrance excuse the remark â i do not think it likely sir mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort is not very fond of society and we very seldom go out said the young lady then it was not in society that i met with mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars or yourself madame or this charming little merry boy besides the parisian world is entirely unknown to me for as i believe i told you i have been in paris but very few day no but perhaps you will permit me to call to mindâ stay
the count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect his thoughts noâ it was somewhereâ away from hereâ it wasâ i do not knowâ but it appears that this recollection is connected with a lovely sky and some religious fãªte mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was holding flowers in her hand the interesting boy was chasing a beautiful peacock in a garden and you madame were under the trellis of some arbor pray come to my aid madame do not these circumstances appeal to your memory â no indeed replied madame m_noirtier_de_villefort and yet it appears to me sir that if i had met you anywhere the recollection of you must have been imprinted on my memory â perhaps the count saw us in italy said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort timidly â_yes in italy it was in italy most probably replied count_of_monte_cristo you have travelled then in italy mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â_yes madame and i were there two year ago the doctors anxious for my lungs had prescribed the air of naples we went by bologna perugia and rome â ah yesâ true mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars exclaimed count_of_monte_cristo as if this simple explanation was sufficient to revive the recollection he sought â_it was at perugia on corpus christi day in the garden of the hã tel des postes when chance brought us together you madame m_noirtier_de_villefort and her son i now remember having had the honor of meeting you â i perfectly well remember perugia sir and the hã tel des postes and the festival of which you speak said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort but in vain do i tax my memory of whose treachery i am ashamed for i really do not recall to mind that i ever had the pleasure of seeing you before â_it is strange but neither do i recollect meeting with you observed mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort raising her beautiful eye to the count
30065m but i remember it perfectly interposed the darling edward i will assist your memory madame continued the count the day had been burning hot you were waiting for horse which were delayed in consequence of the festival mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was walking in the shade of the garden and your son disappeared in pursuit of the peacock â and i caught it mamma donâ you remember interposed edward and i pulled three such beautiful feathers out of his tail â you madame remained under the arbor do you not remember that while you were seated on a stone bench and while as i told you mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort and your young son were absent you conversed for a considerable time with somebody â_yes in truth yes answered the young lady turning very red i do remember conversing with a person wrapped in a long woollen mantle he was a medical man i think â precisely so madame this man was myself for a fortnight i had been at that hotel during which period i had cured my valet de chambre of a fever and my landlord of the jaundice so that i really acquired a reputation as a skilful physician
we discoursed a long time madame on different subjects of perugino of raphael of manner customs of the famous aqua tofana of which they had told you i think you said that certain individuals in perugia had preserved the secret â_yes true replied madame m_noirtier_de_villefort somewhat uneasily i remember now â i do not recollect now all the various subjects of which we discoursed madame continued the count with perfect calmness but i perfectly remember that falling into the error which others had entertained respecting me you consulted me as to the health of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort â_yes really sir you were in fact a medical man said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort since you had cured the sick â moliã re or beaumarchais would reply to you madame that it was precisely because i was not that i had cured my patients for myself i am content to say to you that i have studied chemistry and the natural sciences somewhat deeply but still only as an amateur you understand at this moment the clock struck six â_it is six oâ clock said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort evidently agitated mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort will you not go and see if your grandpapa will have his dinner mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort rose and saluting the count left the apartment without speaking â_oh madame said the count when mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort had left the room was it on my account that you sent mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort away â by no means replied the young lady quickly but this is the hour when we usually give m_noirtier_de_villefort the unwelcome meal that sustains his pitiful existence
you are aware sir of the deplorable condition of my husbandâ father â_yes madame m_noirtier_de_villefort spoke of it to meâ a paralysis i think â alas yes the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless the mind alone is still active in this human machine and that is faint and flickering like the light of a lamp about to expire but excuse me sir for talking of our domestic misfortunes i interrupted you at the moment when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist â no madame i did not say as much as that replied the count with a smile quite the contrary i have studied chemistry because having determined to live in eastern climates i have been desirous of following the example of king mithridates â mithridates rex ponticus said the young scamp as he tore some beautiful portraits out of a splendid album the individual who took cream in his cup of poison every morning at breakfast â edward you naughty boy exclaimed madame m_noirtier_de_villefort snatching the mutilated book from the urchinâ grasp you are positively past bearing you really disturb the conversation go leave us and join your sister mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort in dear grandpapa noirtierâ room â the album said edward sulkily what do you mean the album â i want the album â how dare you tear out the drawings â_oh it amuses me â goâ go at once â i wonâ go unless you give me the album said the boy seating himself doggedly in an armchair according to his habit of never giving way take it then and pray disturb us no longer said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort giving the album to edward who then went towards the door led by his mother the count followed her with his eye
â let us see if she shuts the door after him he muttered madame m_noirtier_de_villefort closed the door carefully after the child the count appearing not to notice her then casting a scrutinizing glance around the chamber the young wife returned to her chair in which she seated herself allow me to observe madame said the count with that kind tone he could assume so well you are really very severe with that dear clever child â_oh sometimes severity is quite necessary replied madame m_noirtier_de_villefort with all a motherâ real firmness â_it was his cornelius nepos that master edward was repeating when he referred to king mithridates continued the count and you interrupted him in a quotation which proves that his tutor has by no means neglected him for your son is really advanced for his year â the fact is count answered the mother agreeably flattered he has great aptitude and learns all that is set before him he has but one fault he is somewhat wilful but really on referring for the moment to what he said do you truly believe that mithridates used these precautions and that these precautions were efficacious â i think so madame because i myself have made use of them that i might not be poisoned at naples at palermo and at smyrnaâ that is to say on three several occasions when but for these precautions i must have lost my life â and
your precautions were successful â completely so â_yes i remember now your mentioning to me at perugia something of this sort â indeed said the count with an air of surprise remarkably well counterfeited i really did not remember â i inquired of you if poisons acted equally and with the same effect on man of the north as on man of the south and you answered me that the cold and sluggish habits of the north did not present the same aptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the south â and that is the case observed count_of_monte_cristo i have seen russians devour without being visibly inconvenienced vegetable substances which would infallibly have killed a neapolitan or an arab â and you really believe the result would be still more sure with us than in the east and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would habituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this progressive absorption of poison â certainly it being at the same time perfectly understood that he should have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not been accustomed â_yes i understand that and how would you habituate yourself for instance or rather how did you habituate yourself to it â_oh very easily suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would be made use of against you suppose the poison was for instance brucineâ â brucine is extracted from the false angostura8 is it not inquired madame m_noirtier_de_villefort precisely madame replied count_of_monte_cristo but i perceive i have not much to teach you allow me to compliment you on your knowledge such learning is very rare among ladies â_oh i am aware of that said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort but
i have a passion for the occult sciences which speak to the imagination like poetry and are reducible to figures like an algebraic equation but go on i beg of you what you say interests me to the greatest degree 30069m well replied count_of_monte_cristo suppose then that this poison was brucine and you were to take a milligramme the first day two milligrammes the second day and so on well at the end of ten day you would have taken a centigramme at the end of twenty day increasing another milligramme you would have taken three hundred centigrammes that is to say a dose which you would support without inconvenience and which would be very dangerous for any other person who had not taken the same precautions as yourself well then at the end of a month when drinking water from the same carafe you would kill the person who drank with you without your perceiving otherwise than from slight inconvenience that there was any poisonous substance mingled with this water â do you know any other counter poisons â i do not â i have often read and read again the history of mithridates said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort in a tone of reflection and had always considered it a fable â no madame contrary to most history it is true but what you tell me madame what you inquire of me is not the result of a chance query for two year ago you asked me the same questions and said then that for a very long time this history of mithridates had occupied your mind â true sir
the two favorite studies of my youth were botany and mineralogy and subsequently when i learned that the use of simples frequently explained the whole history of a people and the entire life of individuals in the east as flowers betoken and symbolize a love affair i have regretted that i was not a man that i might have been a flamel a fontana or a cabanis â and the more madame said count_of_monte_cristo as the orientals do not confine themselves as did mithridates to make a cuirass of his poisons but they also made them a dagger science becomes in their hand not only a defensive weapon but still more frequently an offensive one the one serves against all their physical sufferings the other against all their enemies with opium belladonna brucea snake wood and the cherry laurel they put to sleep all who stand in their way there is not one of those woman egyptian turkish or greek whom here you call good woman who do not know how by means of chemistry to stupefy a doctor and in psychology to amaze a confessor â really said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort whose eye sparkled with strange fire at this conversation â_oh yes indeed madame continued count_of_monte_cristo the secret dramas of the east begin with a love philtre and end with a death potionâ begin with paradise and end withâ hell
there are as many elixirs of every kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral nature of humanity and i will say furtherâ the art of these chemists is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the remedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance â but sir remarked the young woman these eastern societies in the midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence are as fantastic as the tales that come from their strange land a man can easily be put out of the way there then it is indeed the bagdad and bassora of the thousand and one night the sultans and viziers who rule over society there and who constitute what in france we call the government are really haroun al raschids and giaffars who not only pardon a poisoner but even make him a prime minister if his crime has been an ingenious one and who under such circumstances have the whole story written in letter of gold to divert their hour of idleness and ennui â by no means madame the fanciful exists no longer in the east there disguised under other name and concealed under other costumes are police agents magistrates attorneys general and bailiffs they hang behead and impale their criminals in the most agreeable possible manner but some of these like clever rogues have contrived to escape human justice and succeed in their fraudulent enterprises by cunning stratagems
amongst us a simpleton possessed by the demon of hate or cupidity who has an enemy to destroy or some near relation to dispose of goes straight to the grocerâ or druggistâ gives a false name which leads more easily to his detection than his real one and under the pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping purchases five or six grammes of arsenicâ if he is really a cunning fellow he goes to five or six different druggists or grocers and thereby becomes only five or six time more easily traced then when he has acquired his specific he administers duly to his enemy or near kinsman a dose of arsenic which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst and which without rhyme or reason makes his victim utter groans which alarm the entire neighborhood then arrive a crowd of policemen and constables they fetch a doctor who opens the dead body and collects from the entrails and stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon next day a hundred newspapers relate the fact with the name of the victim and the murderer the same evening the grocer or grocers druggist or druggists come and say â_it was i who sold the arsenic to the gentleman and rather than not recognize the guilty purchaser they will recognize twenty then the foolish criminal is taken imprisoned interrogated confronted confounded condemned and cut off by hemp or steel or if she be a woman of any consideration they lock her up for life this is the way in which you northerns understand chemistry madame desrues was however i must confess more skilful â what would you have sir said the lady laughing we do what we can
all the world has not the secret of the medicis or the borgias â now replied the count shrugging his shoulders shall i tell you the cause of all these stupidities it is because at your theatres by what at least i could judge by reading the pieces they play they see person swallow the contents of a phial or suck the button of a ring and fall dead instantly five minute afterwards the curtain falls and the spectators depart they are ignorant of the consequences of the murder they see neither the police commissary with his badge of office nor the corporal with his four man and so the poor fools believe that the whole thing is as easy as lying but go a little way from franceâ go either to aleppo or cairo or only to naples or rome and you will see people passing by you in the streetsâ people erect smiling and fresh colored of whom asmodeus if you were holding on by the skirt of his mantle would say that man was poisoned three weeks ago he will be a dead man in a month â then remarked madame m_noirtier_de_villefort they have again discovered the secret of the famous aqua tofana that they said was lost at perugia â ah but madame does mankind ever lose anything the arts change about and make a tour of the world thing take a different name and the vulgar do not follow themâ that is all but there is always the same result poisons act particularly on some organ or anotherâ one on the stomach another on the brain another on the intestines
well the poison brings on a cough the cough an inflammation of the lungs or some other complaint catalogued in the book of science which however by no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal and if it were not would be sure to become so thanks to the remedies applied by foolish doctors who are generally bad chemists and which will act in favor of or against the malady as you please and then there is a human being killed according to all the rules of art and skill and of whom justice learns nothing as was said by a terrible chemist of my acquaintance the worthy abbã adelmonte of taormina in sicily who has studied these national phenomena very profoundly â_it is quite frightful but deeply interesting said the young lady motionless with attention i thought i must confess that these tales were inventions of the middle ages â_yes no doubt but improved upon by ours what is the use of time rewards of merit medals crosses monthyon prizes if they do not lead society towards more complete perfection yet man will never be perfect until he learns to create and destroy he does know how to destroy and that is half the battle â so added madame m_noirtier_de_villefort constantly returning to her object the poisons of the borgias the medicis the renã es the ruggieris and later probably that of baron de trenck whose story has been so misused by modern drama and romanceâ â were objects of art madame and nothing more replied the count do you suppose that the real savant addresses himself stupidly to the mere individual by no means science loves eccentricities leaps and bounds trials of strength fancies if i may be allowed so to term them
thus for instance the excellent abbã adelmonte of whom i spoke just now made in this way some marvellous experiments â really â_yes i will mention one to you he had a remarkably fine garden full of vegetables flowers and fruit from amongst these vegetables he selected the most simpleâ a cabbage for instance for three day he watered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic on the third the cabbage began to droop and turn yellow at that moment he cut it in the eye of everybody it seemed fit for table and preserved its wholesome appearance it was only poisoned to the abbã adelmonte he then took the cabbage to the room where he had rabbitsâ for the abbã adelmonte had a collection of rabbits cats and guinea pigs fully as fine as his collection of vegetables flowers and fruit well the abbã adelmonte took a rabbit and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage the rabbit died what magistrate would find or even venture to insinuate anything against this what procureur has ever ventured to draw up an accusation against magendie or flourens in consequence of the rabbits cats and guinea pigs they have killed not one so then the rabbit dies and justice takes no notice this rabbit dead the abbã adelmonte has its entrails taken out by his cook and thrown on the dunghill on this dunghill is a hen who pecking these intestines is in her turn taken ill and dies next day at the moment when she is struggling in the convulsions of death a vulture is flying by there are a good many vultures in adelmonteâ country this bird darts on the dead fowl and carries it away to a rock where it dines off its prey
three day afterwards this poor vulture which has been very much indisposed since that dinner suddenly feels very giddy while flying aloft in the clouds and falls heavily into a fish pond the pike eels and carp eat greedily always as everybody knowsâ well they feast on the vulture now suppose that next day one of these eels or pike or carp poisoned at the fourth remove is served up at your table well then your guest will be poisoned at the fifth remove and die at the end of eight or ten day of pains in the intestines sickness or abscess of the pylorus the doctors open the body and say with an air of profound learning the subject has died of a tumor on the liver or of typhoid fever â but remarked madame m_noirtier_de_villefort all these circumstances which you link thus to one another may be broken by the least accident the vulture may not see the fowl or may fall a hundred yards from the fish pond â ah that is where the art comes in to be a great chemist in the east one must direct chance and this is to be achieved madame m_noirtier_de_villefort was in deep thought yet listened attentively but she exclaimed suddenly arsenic is indelible indestructible in whatsoever way it is absorbed it will be found again in the body of the victim from the moment when it has been taken in sufficient quantity to cause death â precisely so cried monte cristoâ precisely so and this is what i said to my worthy adelmonte he reflected smiled and replied to me by a sicilian proverb which i believe is also a french proverb my son the world was not made in a dayâ but in seven
return on sunday on the sunday following i did return to him instead of having watered his cabbage with arsenic he had watered it this time with a solution of salts having their basis in strychnine strychnos colubrina as the learned term it now the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of disease in the world and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust yet five minute afterwards the rabbit was dead the fowl pecked at the rabbit and the next day was a dead hen this time we were the vultures so we opened the bird and this time all special symptoms had disappeared there were only general symptoms there was no peculiar indication in any organâ an excitement of the nervous systemâ that was it a case of cerebral congestionâ nothing more the fowl had not been poisonedâ she had died of apoplexy apoplexy is a rare disease among fowls i believe but very common among man madame m_noirtier_de_villefort appeared more and more thoughtful â_it is very fortunate she observed that such substances could only be prepared by chemists otherwise all the world would be poisoning each other â by chemists and person who have a taste for chemistry said count_of_monte_cristo carelessly and then said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort endeavoring by a struggle and with effort to get away from her thoughts however skilfully it is prepared crime is always crime and if it avoid human scrutiny it does not escape the eye of god the orientals are stronger than we are in cases of conscience and very prudently have no hellâ that is the point 30075m really madame this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure mind like yours but which would easily yield before sound reasoning
the bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of jean jacques rousseau you remember the mandarin who is killed five hundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger manâ whole life passes in doing these thing and his intellect is exhausted by reflecting on them you will find very few person who will go and brutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellow creature or will administer to him in order to remove him from the surface of the globe on which we move with life and animation that quantity of arsenic of which we just now talked such a thing is really out of ruleâ eccentric or stupid to attain such a point the blood must be heated to thirty six degrees the pulse be at least at ninety and the feelings excited beyond the ordinary limit but suppose one pass as is permissible in philology from the word itself to its softened synonym then instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an elimination you merely and simply remove from your path the individual who is in your way and that without shock or violence without the display of the sufferings which in the case of becoming a punishment make a martyr of the victim and a butcher in every sense of the word of him who inflicts them then there will be no blood no groans no convulsions and above all no consciousness of that horrid and compromising moment of accomplishing the act then one escapes the clutch of the human law which says do not disturb society
this is the mode in which they manage these thing and succeed in eastern climes where there are grave and phlegmatic person who care very little for the questions of time in conjunctures of importance â yet conscience remains remarked madame m_noirtier_de_villefort in an agitated voice and with a stifled sigh â_yes answered count_of_monte_cristo happily yes conscience does remain and if it did not how wretched we should be after every action requiring exertion it is conscience that saves us for it supplies us with a thousand good excuses of which we alone are judges and these reasons howsoever excellent in producing sleep would avail us but very little before a tribunal when we were tried for our life thus richard iii for instance was marvellously served by his conscience after the putting away of the two child of edward iv in fact he could say these two child of a cruel and persecuting king who have inherited the vices of their father which i alone could perceive in their juvenile propensitiesâ these two child are impediments in my way of promoting the happiness of the english people whose unhappiness they the child would infallibly have caused thus was lady macbeth served by her conscience when she sought to give her son and not her husband whatever shakespeare may say a throne ah maternal love is a great virtue a powerful motiveâ so powerful that it excuses a multitude of thing even if after duncanâ death lady macbeth had been at all pricked by her conscience madame m_noirtier_de_villefort listened with avidity to these appalling maxims and horrible paradoxes delivered by the count with that ironical simplicity which was peculiar to him after a momentâ silence the lady inquired do you know my dear count
she said that you are a very terrible reasoner and that you look at the world through a somewhat distempered medium have you really measured the world by scrutinies or through alembics and crucibles for you must indeed be a great chemist and the elixir you administered to my son which recalled him to life almost instantaneouslyâ â 30077m â_oh do not place any reliance on that madame one drop of that elixir sufficed to recall life to a dying child but three drops would have impelled the blood into his lungs in such a way as to have produced most violent palpitations six would have suspended his respiration and caused syncope more serious than that in which he was ten would have destroyed him you know madame how suddenly i snatched him from those phials which he so imprudently touched â is it then so terrible a poison â_oh no in the first place let us agree that the word poison does not exist because in medicine use is made of the most violent poisons which become according as they are employed most salutary remedies â what then is it â a skilful preparation of my friendâ the worthy abbã adelmonte who taught me the use of it â_oh observed madame m_noirtier_de_villefort â_it must be an admirable anti spasmodic â perfect madame as you have seen replied the count and i frequently make use of itâ with all possible prudence though be it observed he added with a smile of intelligence most assuredly responded madame m_noirtier_de_villefort in the same tone as for me so nervous and so subject to fainting fits i should require a doctor adelmonte to invent for me some means of breathing freely and tranquillizing my mind in the fear i have of dying some fine day of suffocation
in the meanwhile as the thing is difficult to find in france and your abbã is not probably disposed to make a journey to paris on my account i must continue to use monsieur_albert plancheâ anti spasmodics and mint and hoffmanâ drops are among my favorite remedies here are some lozenges which i have made up on purpose they are compounded doubly strong count_of_monte_cristo opened the tortoise shell box which the lady presented to him and inhaled the odor of the lozenges with the air of an amateur who thoroughly appreciated their composition they are indeed exquisite he said but as they are necessarily submitted to the process of deglutitionâ a function which it is frequently impossible for a fainting person to accomplishâ i prefer my own specific â undoubtedly and so should i prefer it after the effects i have seen produced but of course it is a secret and i am not so indiscreet as to ask it of you â but i said count_of_monte_cristo rising as he spokeâ i am gallant enough to offer it you 30079m how kind you are â only remember one thingâ a small dose is a remedy a large one is poison one drop will restore life as you have seen five or six will inevitably kill and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as poured into a glass of wine it would not in the slightest degree affect its flavor but i say no more madame it is really as if i were prescribing for you the clock struck half past six and a lady was announced a friend of madame m_noirtier_de_villefort who came to dine with her if i had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time count instead of only for the second said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort if
i had had the honor of being your friend instead of only having the happiness of being under an obligation to you i should insist on detaining you to dinner and not allow myself to be daunted by a first refusal â a thousand thanks madame replied count_of_monte_cristo but i have an engagement which i cannot break i have promised to escort to the acadã mie a greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your grand opera and who relies on me to conduct her thither â adieu then sir and do not forget the prescription â ah in truth madame to do that i must forget the hourâ conversation i have had with you which is indeed impossible count_of_monte_cristo bowed and left the house_of_peers madame m_noirtier_de_villefort remained immersed in thought he is a very strange man she said and in my opinion is himself the adelmonte he talks about as to count_of_monte_cristo the result had surpassed his utmost expectations good said he as he went away this is a fruitful soil and i feel certain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren ground next morning faithful to his promise he sent the prescription requested chapter 53 robert le diable the pretext of an opera engagement was so much the more feasible as there chanced to be on that very night a more than ordinary attraction at the acadã mie royale levasseur who had been suffering under severe illness made his reappearance in the character of bertram and as usual the announcement of the most admired production of the favorite composer of the day had attracted a brilliant and fashionable audience
morcerf like most other young man of rank and fortune had his orchestra stall with the certainty of always finding a seat in at least a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by person of his acquaintance he had moreover his right of entry into the omnibus box baron_de_chã_teau_renaud rented a stall beside his own while m_beauchamp as a journalist had unlimited range all over the theatre it happened that on this particular night the ministerâ box was placed at the disposal of m_lucien_debray who offered it to the comte de viscount_albert_de_morcerf who again upon his rejection of it by mercã_dã_s sent it to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening in the event of their accepting the box in question the ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal to no class of person is the presentation of a gratuitous opera box more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a kingâ ransom in his waistcoat pocket mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had however protested against showing himself in a ministerial box declaring that his political principles and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself the baroness had therefore despatched a note to m_lucien_debray bidding him call for them it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars to the opera there is no gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction would have been put upon the circumstance if the two woman had gone without escort while the addition of a third in the person of her motherâ admitted lover enabled mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars to defy malice and ill nature
one must take the world as one finds it 30083 the curtain rose as usual to an almost empty house_of_peers it being one of the absurdities of parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until after the beginning of the performance so that the first act is generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it that part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in observing the fresh arrivals while nothing is heard but the noise of opening and shutting door and the buzz of conversation surely said monsieur_albert as the door of a box on the first circle opened that must be the countess gâ â and who is the countess gâ â inquired baron_de_chã_teau_renaud what a question now do you know baron i have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it as if all the world did not know who the countess gâ was â ah to be sure replied baron_de_chã_teau_renaud the lovely venetian is it not â herself at this moment the countess perceived monsieur_albert and returned his salutation with a smile you know her it seems said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud m_franz_de_quesnel introduced me to her at rome replied monsieur_albert well then will you do as much for me in paris as m_franz_de_quesnel did for you in rome â with pleasure there was a cry of shut up from the audience this manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music produced not the slightest effect on the two young man who continued their conversation the countess was present at the races in the champ de mars said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud today â_yes â bless me i quite forgot the races did you bet â_oh merely a paltry fifty louis_xviii â and who was the winner â nautilus
i staked on him â but there were three races were there not â_yes there was the prize given by the jockey clubâ a gold cup you knowâ and a very singular circumstance occurred about that race â what was it â_oh shut up again interposed some of the audience why it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course â is that possible â true as day the fact was nobody had observed a horse entered by the name of luigi_vampa or that of a jockey styled job when at the last moment a splendid roan mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist presented themselves at the starting post they were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small riderâ pockets to make him weight but with all that he outstripped ariel and barbare against whom he ran by at least three whole lengths â and was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey belonged â no â you say that the horse was entered under the name of luigi_vampa â exactly that was the title â then answered monsieur_albert i am better informed than you are and know who the owner of that horse was â shut up there cried the pit in chorus and this time the tone and manner in which the command was given betokened such growing hostility that the two young man perceived for the first time that the mandate was addressed to them leisurely turning round they calmly scrutinized the various countenances around them as though demanding some one person who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they deemed excessive impertinence but as no one responded to the challenge the friend turned again to the front of the theatre and affected to busy themselves with the stage
at this moment the door of the ministerâ box opened and madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by m_lucien_debray who assiduously conducted them to their seats ha ha said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud here come some friend of yours viscount what are you looking at there donâ you see they are trying to catch your eye monsieur_albert turned round just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the baroness as for mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eye even upon the business of the stage i tell you what my dear fellow said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud i cannot imagine what objection you can possibly have to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars danglarsâ that is setting aside her want of ancestry and somewhat inferior rank which by the way i donâ think you care very much about now barring all that i mean to say she is a deuced fine girl â handsome certainly replied monsieur_albert but not to my taste which i confess inclines to something softer gentler and more feminine â ah well exclaimed baron_de_chã_teau_renaud who because he had seen his thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of paternal air with his more youthful friend you young people are never satisfied why what would you have more your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of diana the huntress and yet you are not content â no for that very resemblance affrights me i should have liked something more in the manner of the venus of milo or capua but this chase loving diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of actã on
and indeed it required but one glance at mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars to comprehend the justness of morcerfâ remark she was beautiful but her beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious taste her hair was raven black but its natural waves seemed somewhat rebellious her eye of the same color as her hair were surmounted by well arched brows whose great defect however consisted in an almost habitual frown while her whole physiognomy wore that expression of firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler attributes of her sexâ her nose was precisely what a sculptor would have chosen for a chiselled juno her mouth which might have been found fault with as too large displayed teeth of pearly whiteness rendered still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lip contrasting vividly with her naturally pale complexion but that which completed the almost masculine look viscount_albert_de_morcerf found so little to his taste was a dark mole of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally are placed just at the corner of her mouth and the effect tended to increase the expression of self dependence that characterized her countenance the rest of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars eugã nieâ person was in perfect keeping with the head just described she indeed reminded one of diana as baron_de_chã_teau_renaud observed but her bearing was more haughty and resolute as regarded her attainments the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a person
she was a perfect linguist a first rate artist wrote poetry and composed music to the study of the latter she professed to be entirely devoted following it with an indefatigable perseverance assisted by a schoolfellow a young woman without fortune whose talent promised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer it was rumored that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the principal composers of the day who excited her to spare no pains in the cultivation of her voice which might hereafter prove a source of wealth and independence but this counsel effectually decided mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a theatrical life and acting upon this principle the bankerâ daughter though perfectly willing to allow mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly dâ armilly that was the name of the young virtuosa to practice with her through the day took especial care not to be seen in her company still though not actually received at the hã tel mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a governess the curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars into her box the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed half hourâ interval allowed between the acts and the audience were left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies or to pay and receive visits in their respective boxes viscount_albert_de_morcerf and baron_de_chã_teau_renaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of this permission for an instant the idea struck madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party and she whispered her expectations to her daughter that monsieur_albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them
mademoiselle mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars however merely returned a dissenting movement of the head while with a cold smile she directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first circle in which sat the countess gâ and where viscount_albert_de_morcerf had just made his appearance 30087m so we meet again my travelling friend do we cried the countess extending her hand to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old acquaintance â_it was really very good of you to recognize me so quickly and still more so to bestow your first visit on me â be assured replied monsieur_albert that if i had been aware of your arrival in paris and had known your address i should have paid my respects to you before this allow me to introduce my friend baron_de_chã_teau_renaud one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in france and from whom i have just learned that you were a spectator of the races in the champ de mars yesterday baron_de_chã_teau_renaud bowed to the countess so you were at the races baron inquired the countess eagerly â_yes madame â well then pursued madame gâ with considerable animation you can probably tell me who won the jockey club stakes â i am sorry to say i cannot replied the baron and i was just asking the same question of monsieur_albert â are you very anxious to know countess asked monsieur_albert to know what â the name of the owner of the winning horse â excessively only imagineâ but do tell me viscount whether you really are acquainted with it or no â i beg your pardon madame but you were about to relate some story were you not you said only imagine â and then paused pray continue â well then listen
you must know i felt so interested in the splendid roan horse with his elegant little rider so tastefully dressed in a pink satin jacket and cap that i could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at stake and when i saw them outstrip all the others and come to the winning post in such gallant style i actually clapped my hand with joy imagine my surprise when upon returning home the first object i met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket i concluded that by some singular chance the owner of the winning horse must live in the same hotel as myself but as i entered my apartments i beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and rider inside the cup was a small piece of paper on which were written these wordsâ from lord_ruthven to countess gâ â â precisely i was sure of it said viscount_albert_de_morcerf sure of what â that the owner of the horse was lord_ruthven himself â what lord_ruthven do you mean â why our lord ruthvenâ the vampire of the salle argentina â is it possible exclaimed the countess is he here in paris â to be sure why not â and you visit him meet him at your own house_of_peers and elsewhere â i assure you he is my most intimate friend and de baron_de_chã_teau_renaud has also the honor of his acquaintance â but why are you so sure of his being the winner of the jockey club prize â was
not the winning horse entered by the name of luigi_vampa â what of that â why do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom i was made prisoner â_oh yes â and from whose hand the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner â to be sure i remember it all now â he called himself luigi_vampa you see itâ evident where the count got the name â but what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me â in the first place because i had spoken much of you to him as you may believe and in the second because he delighted to see a countrywoman take so lively an interest in his success â i trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him â i should not like to affirm upon oath that i have not besides his presenting you the cup under the name of lord ruthvenâ â â_oh but that is dreadful why the man must owe me a fearful grudge â does his action appear like that of an enemy â no certainly not â well thenâ â and so he is in paris â_yes â and what effect does he produce â why said monsieur_albert he was talked about for a week then the coronation of the queen of england took place followed by the theft of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars marsâ diamonds and so people talked of something else â my good fellow said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud the count is your friend and you treat him accordingly do not believe what monsieur_albert is telling you countess so far from the sensation excited in the parisian circles by the appearance of the count_of_monte_cristo having abated i take upon myself to declare that it is as strong as ever
his first astounding act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horse worth 32 000 franc to madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars his second the almost miraculous preservation of madame de villefortâ life now it seems that he has carried off the prize awarded by the jockey club i therefore maintain in spite of viscount_albert_de_morcerf that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which after all may be his ordinary mode of existence â perhaps you are right said viscount_albert_de_morcerf meanwhile who is in the russian ambassadorâ box â which box do you mean asked the countess the one between the pillars on the first tierâ it seems to have been fitted up entirely afresh â did you observe anyone during the first act asked baron_de_chã_teau_renaud where â in that box â no replied the countess â_it was certainly empty during the first act then resuming the subject of their previous conversation she said and so you really believe it was your mysterious count_of_monte_cristo that gained the prize â i am sure of it â and who afterwards sent the cup to me â undoubtedly â but i donâ know him said the countess i have a great mind to return it â do no such thing i beg of you he would only send you another formed of a magnificent sapphire or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby it is his way and you must take him as you find him at this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act monsieur_albert rose to return to his place shall i see you again asked the countess
â at the end of the next act with your permission i will come and inquire whether there is anything i can do for you in paris â pray take notice said the countess that my present residence is 22 rue de rivoli and that i am at home to my friend every saturday evening so now you are both forewarned the young man bowed and quitted the box upon reaching their stalls they found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the russian ambassador a man of from thirty five to forty year of age dressed in deep black had just entered accompanied by a young woman dressed after the eastern style the lady was surpassingly beautiful while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eye upon her hullo said monsieur_albert â_it is count_of_monte_cristo and his greek the strangers were indeed no other than the count and haydã_e in a few moment the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house_of_peers and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent diamonds the second act passed away during one continued buzz of voicesâ one deep whisperâ intimating that some great and universally interesting event had occurred all eye all thoughts were occupied with the young and beautiful woman whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most extraordinary spectacle upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars intimated her desire to see monsieur_albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act and neither the politeness nor good taste of viscount_albert_de_morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given at the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness
having bowed to the two ladies he extended his hand to m_lucien_debray by the baroness he was most graciously welcomed while mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars received him with her accustomed coldness my dear fellow said m_lucien_debray you have come in the nick of time there is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count she insists upon it that i can tell her his birth education and parentage where he came from and whither he is going being no disciple of cagliostro i was wholly unable to do this so by way of getting out of the scrape i said ask viscount_albert_de_morcerf he has got the whole history of his beloved count_of_monte_cristo at his fingersâ end whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you â is it not almost incredible said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars that a person having at least half a million of secret service money at his command should possess so little information â let me assure you madame said m_lucien_debray that had i really the sum you mention at my disposal i would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the count_of_monte_cristo whose only merit in my eye consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob however i have turned the business over to viscount_albert_de_morcerf so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you for my own part i care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings 30093m i am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horse worth 32 000 franc wearing on their head four diamonds valued at 000 franc each â he seems to have a mania for diamonds said viscount_albert_de_morcerf smiling and
i verily believe that like potemkin he keeps his pockets filled for the sake of strewing them along the road as tom thumb did his flint stones â perhaps he has discovered some mine said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baronâ banking establishment â i was not aware of it replied monsieur_albert but i can readily believe it â and further that he stated to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars his intention of only staying a year in paris during which time he proposed to spend six millions he must be the shah of persia travelling incog â have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman m_lucien_debray inquired mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms of another as yourself responded m_lucien_debray raising his lorgnette to his eye a most lovely creature upon my soul was his verdict who is this young person de viscount_albert_de_morcerf inquired mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars does anybody know â mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars said monsieur_albert replying to this direct appeal i can give you very exact information on that subject as well as on most points relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversingâ the young woman is a greek â so
i should suppose by her dress if you know no more than that everyone here is as well informed as yourself â i am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a cicerone replied viscount_albert_de_morcerf but i am reluctantly obliged to confess i have nothing further to communicateâ yes stay i do know one thing more namely that she is a musician for one day when i chanced to be breakfasting with the count i heard the sound of a guzlaâ it is impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her own â then your count entertains visitors does he asked madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars indeed he does and in a most lavish manner i can assure you â i must try and persuade mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner or something of the sort that he may be compelled to ask us in return â what said m_lucien_debray laughing do you really mean you would go to his house_of_peers â why not my husband could accompany me â but do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor â you have ample proof to the contrary if you look opposite said the baroness as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful greek no no exclaimed m_lucien_debray that girl is not his wife he told us himself she was his slave do you not recollect viscount_albert_de_morcerf his telling us so at your breakfast â well then said the baroness if slave she be she has all the air and manner of a princess â of the arabian nightsâ â if you like but tell me my dear m_lucien_debray what it is that constitutes a princess why diamondsâ and she is covered with them â to me
she seems overloaded observed mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars she would look far better if she wore fewer and we should then be able to see her finely formed throat and wrists â see how the artist peeps out exclaimed madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars my poor mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars you must conceal your passion for the fine arts â i admire all that is beautiful returned the young lady what do you think of the count inquired m_lucien_debray he is not much amiss according to my idea of good look â the count repeated mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner the count â_oh he is so dreadfully pale â i quite agree with you said viscount_albert_de_morcerf and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find out the countess gâ insists upon it that he is a vampire â then the countess gâ has returned to paris has she inquired the baroness is that she mamma asked mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars almost opposite to us with that profusion of beautiful light hair â_yes said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars that is she shall i tell you what you ought to do viscount_albert_de_morcerf â command me madame â well then you should go and bring your count_of_monte_cristo to us â what for asked mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars what for why to converse with him of course have you really no desire to meet him â none whatever replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars strange child murmured the baroness he will very probably come of his own accord said viscount_albert_de_morcerf there do you see madame he recognizes you and bows the baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner well said viscount_albert_de_morcerf i may as well be magnanimous and tear myself away to forward your wishes
adieu i will go and try if there are any means of speaking to him â go straight to his box that will be the simplest plan â but i have never been presented â presented to whom â to the beautiful greek â you say she is only a slave â while you assert that she is a queen or at least a princess no i hope that when he sees me leave you he will come out â that is possibleâ go â i am going said monsieur_albert as he made his parting bow just as he was passing the countâ box the door opened and count_of_monte_cristo came forth after giving some directions to ali_pasha_of_yanina who stood in the lobby the count took albertâ arm carefully closing the box door ali_pasha_of_yanina placed himself before it while a crowd of spectators assembled round the nubian upon my word said count_of_monte_cristo paris is a strange city and the parisians a very singular people see that cluster of person collected around poor ali_pasha_of_yanina who is as much astonished as themselves really one might suppose he was the only nubian they had ever beheld now i can promise you that a frenchman might show himself in public either in tunis constantinople bagdad or cairo without being treated in that way â that shows that the eastern nations have too much good sense to waste their time and attention on objects undeserving of either however as far as ali_pasha_of_yanina is concerned i can assure you the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendantâ you who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in paris â really and what has procured me so flattering a distinction â what why yourself to be sure
you give away horse worth a thousand louis_xviii you save the life of ladies of high rank and beauty under the name of major black you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins not larger than marmots then when you have carried off the golden trophy of victory instead of setting any value on it you give it to the first handsome woman you think of â and who has filled your head with all this nonsense â why in the first place i heard it from madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who by the by is dying to see you in her box or to have you seen there by others secondly i learned it from beauchampâ journal and thirdly from my own imagination why if you sought concealment did you call your horse luigi_vampa â that was an oversight certainly replied the count but tell me does the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf never visit the opera i have been looking for him but without success â he will be here tonight â in what part of the house_of_peers â in the baronessâ box i believe â that charming young woman with her is her daughter â_yes â i congratulate you viscount_albert_de_morcerf smiled we will discuss that subject at length some future time said he but what do you think of the music â what music â why the music you have been listening to â_oh it is well enough as the production of a human composer sung by featherless bipeds to quote the late diogenes â from which it would seem my dear count that you can at pleasure enjoy the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of paradise 30097m you are right in some degree when i wish to listen to sounds more exquisitely attuned to melody than mortal ear ever yet listened to i go to sleep
â then sleep here my dear count the conditions are favorable what else was opera invented for â no thank you your orchestra is too noisy to sleep after the manner i speak of absolute calm and silence are necessary and then a certain preparationâ â i knowâ the famous hashish â precisely so my dear viscount whenever you wish to be regaled with music come and sup with me â i have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you said viscount_albert_de_morcerf do you mean at rome â i do â ah then i suppose you heard haydã eâ guzla the poor exile frequently beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the air of her native land viscount_albert_de_morcerf did not pursue the subject and count_of_monte_cristo himself fell into a silent reverie the bell rang at this moment for the rising of the curtain you will excuse my leaving you said the count turning in the direction of his box what are you going â pray say everything that is kind to countess gâ on the part of her friend the vampire â and what message shall i convey to the baroness â that with her permission i shall do myself the honor of paying my respects in the course of the evening the third act had begun and during its progress the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf according to his promise made his appearance in the box of madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement his presence therefore was wholly unnoticed save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated himself the quick eye of count_of_monte_cristo however marked his coming and a slight though meaning smile passed over his lip
haydã whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage like all unsophisticated natures delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or ear 30099 the third act passed off as usual mesdemoiselles noblet julia and leroux executed the customary pirouettes robert duly challenged the prince of granada and the royal father of the princess isabella taking his daughter by the hand swept round the stage with majestic strides the better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and mantle after which the curtain again fell and the spectators poured forth from the theatre into the lobbies and salon the count left his box and a moment later was saluting the baronne mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and surprise you are welcome count she exclaimed as he entered i have been most anxious to see you that i might repeat orally the thanks writing can so ill express â surely so trifling a circumstance cannot deserve a place in your remembrance believe me madame i had entirely forgotten it â but it is not so easy to forget monsieur_albert that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend madame m_noirtier_de_villefort which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me 30101m this time at least i do not deserve your thanks it was ali_pasha_of_yanina my nubian slave who rendered this service to madame m_noirtier_de_villefort â was it ali_pasha_of_yanina asked the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf who rescued my son from the hand of bandits â no count replied count_of_monte_cristo taking the hand held out to him by the general in
this instance i may fairly and freely accept your thanks but you have already tendered them and fully discharged your debtâ if indeed there existed oneâ and i feel almost mortified to find you still reverting to the subject may i beg of you baroness to honor me with an introduction to your daughter â_oh you are no strangerâ at least not by name replied madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and the last two or three day we have really talked of nothing but you mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars continued the baroness turning towards her daughter this is the count_of_monte_cristo the count bowed while mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars bent her head slightly you have a charming young person with you tonight count said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is she your daughter â no mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars said count_of_monte_cristo astonished at the coolness and freedom of the question she is a poor unfortunate greek left under my care â and what is her name â haydã_e replied count_of_monte_cristo a greek murmured the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf â_yes indeed count said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and tell me did you ever see at the court of ali_pasha_of_yanina tepelini whom you so gloriously and valiantly served a more exquisite beauty or richer costume â did i hear rightly monsieur_albert said count_of_monte_cristo that you served at ali_pasha_of_yanina â i was inspector general of the pashaâ troops replied viscount_albert_de_morcerf and it is no secret that i owe my fortune such as it is to the liberality of the illustrious albanese chief â but look exclaimed madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars where stammered viscount_albert_de_morcerf there said count_of_monte_cristo placing his arm around the count and leaning with him over the front of the box just as haydã_e whose eye were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian perceived his pale features close to morcerfâ face
it was as if the young girl beheld the head of medusa she bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw then uttering a faint cry threw herself back in her seat the sound was heard by the people about ali_pasha_of_yanina who instantly opened the box door why count exclaimed mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars what has happened to your ward she seems to have been taken suddenly ill very probably answered the count but do not be alarmed on her account haydã eâ nervous system is delicately organized and she is peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowersâ nay there are some which cause her to faint if brought into her presence however continued count_of_monte_cristo drawing a small phial from his pocket i have an infallible remedy so saying he bowed to the baroness and her daughter exchanged a parting shake of the hand with m_lucien_debray and the count and left madame danglarsâ box upon his return to haydã_e he found her still very pale as soon as she saw him she seized his hand her own hand were moist and icy cold who was it you were talking with over there she asked with the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf answered count_of_monte_cristo he tells me he served your illustrious father and that he owes his fortune to him â wretch exclaimed haydã_e her eye flashing with rage he sold my father to the turks and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his treachery did not you know that my dear lord â something of this i heard in epirus said count_of_monte_cristo but the particulars are still unknown to me you shall relate them to me my child they are no doubt both curious and interesting â_yes yes but let us go
i feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful man so saying haydã_e arose and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act do you observe said the countess gâ to monsieur_albert who had returned to her side that man does nothing like other people he listens most devoutly to the third act of robert le diable and when the fourth begins takes his departure chapter 54 a flurry in stocks some day after this meeting monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf visited the count_of_monte_cristo at his house_of_peers in the champs lysã es which had already assumed that palace like appearance which the countâ princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences he came to renew the thanks of madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter signed baronne mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars nã hermine de servieux monsieur_albert was accompanied by m_lucien_debray who joining in his friendâ conversation added some passing compliments the source of which the countâ talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess he was convinced that lucienâ visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the rue de la chaussã dâ antin
in short madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars not being able personally to examine in detail the domestic economy and household arrangements of a man who gave away horse worth 30 000 franc and who went to the opera with a greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of money had deputed those eye by which she was accustomed to see to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this incomprehensible person but the count did not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection between lucienâ visit and the curiosity of the baroness you are in constant communication with the baron mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars the count inquired of monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf â_yes count you know what i told you â all remains the same then in that quarter â_it is more than ever a settled thing said m_lucien_debray and considering that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make he adjusted the glass to his eye and biting the top of his gold headed cane began to make the tour of the apartment examining the arm and the pictures ah said count_of_monte_cristo i did not expect that the affair would be so promptly concluded â_oh thing take their course without our assistance while we are forgetting them they are falling into their appointed order and when again our attention is directed to them we are surprised at the progress they have made towards the proposed end my father and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars served together in spain my father in the army and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars in the commissariat department
it was there that my father ruined by the revolution and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who never had possessed any patrimony both laid the foundations of their different fortune â_yes said count_of_monte_cristo i think mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mentioned that in a visit which i paid him and continued he casting a side glance at m_lucien_debray who was turning over the leaves of an album mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is prettyâ i think i remember that to be her name â very pretty or rather very beautiful replied monsieur_albert but of that style of beauty which i do not appreciate i am an ungrateful fellow â you speak as if you were already her husband â ah returned monsieur_albert in his turn looking around to see what m_lucien_debray was doing really said count_of_monte_cristo lowering his voice you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage â mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is too rich for me replied viscount_albert_de_morcerf and that frightens me â bah exclaimed count_of_monte_cristo thatâ a fine reason to give are you not rich yourself â my fatherâ income is about 50 000 franc per annum and he will give me perhaps ten or twelve thousand when i marry â that perhaps might not be considered a large sum in paris especially said the count but everything does not depend on wealth and it is a fine thing to have a good name and to occupy a high station in society your name is celebrated your position magnificent and then the comte de viscount_albert_de_morcerf is a soldier and it is pleasing to see the integrity of a bayard united to the poverty of a duguesclin disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can shine
as for me i consider the union with mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars a most suitable one she will enrich you and you will ennoble her monsieur_albert shook his head and looked thoughtful there is still something else said he i confess observed count_of_monte_cristo that i have some difficulty in comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and beautiful â_oh said viscount_albert_de_morcerf this repugnance if repugnance it may be called is not all on my side â whence can it arise then for you told me your father desired the marriage â_it is my mother who dissents she has a clear and penetrating judgment and does not smile on the proposed union i cannot account for it but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars 30107m ah said the count in a somewhat forced tone that may be easily explained the comtesse de viscount_albert_de_morcerf who is aristocracy and refinement itself does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth that is natural enough â i do not know if that is her reason said monsieur_albert but one thing i do know that if this marriage be consummated it will render her quite miserable there was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair but i had such a sudden attack of indispositionâ â real interrupted the count smiling â_oh real enough from anxiety doubtless at any rate they postponed the matter for two month there is no hurry you know i am not yet twenty one and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is only seventeen but the two month expire next week it must be done my dear count you cannot imagine how my mind is harassed
how happy you are in being exempt from all this â well and why should not you be free too what prevents you from being so â_oh it will be too great a disappointment to my father if i do not marry mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â marry her then said the count with a significant shrug of the shoulders â_yes replied viscount_albert_de_morcerf but that will plunge my mother into positive grief â then do not marry her said the count well i shall see i will try and think over what is the best thing to be done you will give me your advice will you not and if possible extricate me from my unpleasant position i think rather than give pain to my dear mother i would run the risk of offending the count count_of_monte_cristo turned away he seemed moved by this last remark ah said he to m_lucien_debray who had thrown himself into an easy chair at the farthest extremity of the salon and who held a pencil in his right hand and an account book in his left what are you doing there are you making a sketch after poussin â_oh no was the tranquil response i am too fond of art to attempt anything of that sort i am doing a little sum in arithmetic â in arithmetic â_yes i am calculatingâ by the way viscount_albert_de_morcerf that indirectly concerns youâ i am calculating what the house_of_peers of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars must have gained by the last rise in haiti bonds from 206 they have risen to 409 in three day and the prudent banker had purchased at 206 therefore he must have made 300 000 livres â that is not his biggest scoop said viscount_albert_de_morcerf did he not make a million in spaniards this last year â my
dear fellow said m_lucien_debray here is the count_of_monte_cristo who will say to you as the italians do â denaro santitã metã della metã 9 when they tell me such thing i only shrug my shoulders and say nothing â but you were speaking of haitians said count_of_monte_cristo ah haitians that is quite another thing haitians are the cartã of french stock jobbing we may like bouillotte delight in whist be enraptured with boston and yet grow tired of them all but we always come back to cartã â_it is not only a game it is a hors dâ uvre mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars sold yesterday at 405 and pockets 300 000 franc had he but waited till today the price would have fallen to 205 and instead of gaining 300 000 franc he would have lost 20 or 25 000 â and what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206 asked count_of_monte_cristo i am profoundly ignorant of all these stock jobbing intrigues â because said monsieur_albert laughing one piece of news follows another and there is often great dissimilarity between them â ah said the count i see that mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is accustomed to play at gaining or losing 300 000 franc in a day he must be enormously rich â_it is not he who plays exclaimed m_lucien_debray â_it is madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars she is indeed daring â but you who are a reasonable being m_lucien_debray and who knows how little dependence is to be placed on the news since you are at the fountain head surely you ought to prevent it said viscount_albert_de_morcerf with a smile how can i if her husband fails in controlling her asked m_lucien_debray you know the character of the baronessâ no one has any influence with her and she does precisely what she pleases â ah if i were in your placeâ â said monsieur_albert
â well â i would reform her it would be rendering a service to her future son in law â how would you set about it â ah that would be easy enoughâ i would give her a lesson â a lesson â_yes your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority great on the subject of political news you never open your mouth but the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your word cause her to lose a hundred thousand franc and that would teach her prudence â i do not understand stammered m_lucien_debray â_it is very clear notwithstanding replied the young man with an artlessness wholly free from affectation tell her some fine morning an unheard of piece of intelligenceâ some telegraphic despatch of which you alone are in possession for instance that henri iv was seen yesterday at gabrielleâ that would boom the market she will buy heavily and she will certainly lose when m_beauchamp announces the following day in his gazette the report circulated by some usually well informed person that the king was seen yesterday at gabrielleâ house_of_peers is totally without foundation we can positively assert that his majesty did not quit the pont neuf â m_lucien_debray half smiled count_of_monte_cristo although apparently indifferent had not lost one word of this conversation and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary this embarrassment had completely escaped monsieur_albert but it caused m_lucien_debray to shorten his visit he was evidently ill at ease the count in taking leave of him said something in a low voice to which he answered willingly count i accept the count returned to young viscount_albert_de_morcerf do you not think on reflection said he to him that you have done wrong in thus speaking of your mother in law in the presence of m_lucien_debray â my
dear count said viscount_albert_de_morcerf i beg of you not to apply that title so prematurely â now speaking without any exaggeration is your mother really so very much averse to this marriage â so much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house_of_peers and my mother has not i think visited madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars twice in her whole life â then said the count i am emboldened to speak openly to you mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is my banker m_noirtier_de_villefort has overwhelmed me with politeness in return for a service which a casual piece of good fortune enabled me to render him i predict from all this an avalanche of dinners and routs now in order not to presume on this and also to be beforehand with them i have if agreeable to you thought of inviting and madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and and madame m_noirtier_de_villefort to my country house_of_peers at auteuil if i were to invite you and the count and countess of viscount_albert_de_morcerf to this dinner i should give it the appearance of being a matrimonial meeting or at least madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf would look upon the affair in that light especially if baron mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter in that case your mother would hold me in aversion and i do not at all wish that on the contrary i desire to stand high in her esteem â indeed count said viscount_albert_de_morcerf i thank you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me and i gratefully accept the exclusion which you propose you say you desire my motherâ good opinion i assure you it is already yours to a very unusual extent 30111m do you think so said count_of_monte_cristo with interest
â oh i am sure of it we talked of you an hour after you left us the other day but to return to what we were saying if my mother could know of this attention on your partâ and i will venture to tell herâ i am sure that she will be most grateful to you it is true that my father will be equally angry the count laughed well said he to viscount_albert_de_morcerf but i think your father will not be the only angry one and madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars will think me a very ill mannered person they know that i am intimate with youâ that you are in fact one of the oldest of my parisian acquaintancesâ and they will not find you at my house_of_peers they will certainly ask me why i did not invite you be sure to provide yourself with some previous engagement which shall have a semblance of probability and communicate the fact to me by a line in writing you know that with bankers nothing but a written document will be valid â i will do better than that said monsieur_albert my mother is wishing to go to the sea sideâ what day is fixed for your dinner â saturday â this is tuesdayâ well tomorrow evening we leave and the day after we shall be at trã port really count you have a delightful way of setting people at their ease â indeed you give me more credit than i deserve i only wish to do what will be agreeable to you that is all â when shall you send your invitations â this very day â well i will immediately call on mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and tell him that my mother and myself must leave paris tomorrow i have not seen you consequently i know nothing of your dinner â how foolish you are
have you forgotten that m_lucien_debray has just seen you at my house_of_peers â ah true â fix it this way i have seen you and invited you without any ceremony when you instantly answered that it would be impossible for you to accept as you were going to trã port â well then that is settled but you will come and call on my mother before tomorrow â before tomorrow that will be a difficult matter to arrange besides i shall just be in the way of all the preparations for departure â well you can do better you were only a charming man before but if you accede to my proposal you will be adorable â what must i do to attain such sublimity â you are today free as airâ come and dine with me we shall be a small partyâ only yourself my mother and i you have scarcely seen my mother you shall have an opportunity of observing her more closely she is a remarkable woman and i only regret that there does not exist another like her about twenty year younger in that case i assure you there would very soon be a countess and viscountess of viscount_albert_de_morcerf as to my father you will not see him he is officially engaged and dines with the chief referendary we will talk over our travels and you who have seen the whole world will relate your adventuresâ you shall tell us the history of the beautiful greek who was with you the other night at the opera and whom you call your slave and yet treat like a princess we will talk italian and spanish come accept my invitation and my mother will thank you â a
thousand thanks said the count your invitation is most gracious and i regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to accept it i am not so much at liberty as you suppose on the contrary i have a most important engagement â ah take care you were teaching me just now how in case of an invitation to dinner one might creditably make an excuse i require the proof of a pre engagement i am not a banker like mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars but i am quite as incredulous as he is â i am going to give you a proof replied the count and he rang the bell humph said viscount_albert_de_morcerf this is the second time you have refused to dine with my mother it is evident that you wish to avoid her count_of_monte_cristo started â_oh you do not mean that said he besides here comes the confirmation of my assertion monsieur_baptistin entered and remained standing at the door i had no previous knowledge of your visit had i â indeed you are such an extraordinary person that i would not answer for it â at all events i could not guess that you would invite me to dinner â probably not â well listen monsieur_baptistin what did i tell you this morning when i called you into my laboratory â to close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck five replied the valet what then â ah my dear count said monsieur_albert no no i wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have given me my dear viscount it is tiresome to be always acting manfred i wish my life to be free and open
go on monsieur_baptistin â then to admit no one except major bartolomeo_cavalcanti m_andrea_cavalcanti and his son â you hearâ major bartolomeo_cavalcanti cavalcantiâ a man who ranks amongst the most ancient nobility of italy whose name dante has celebrated in the tenth canto of the inferno you remember it do you not then there is his son m_andrea_cavalcanti a charming young man about your own age viscount bearing the same title as yourself and who is making his entry into the parisian world aided by his fatherâ millions the major will bring his son with him this evening the contino as we say in italy he confides him to my care if he proves himself worthy of it i will do what i can to advance his interests you will assist me in the work will you not â most undoubtedly this major m_andrea_cavalcanti is an old friend of yours then â by no means he is a perfect nobleman very polite modest and agreeable such as may be found constantly in italy descendants of very ancient families i have met him several time at florence bologna and lucca and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in paris the acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort of claim on one they everywhere expect to receive the same attention which you once paid them by chance as though the civilities of a passing hour were likely to awaken any lasting interest in favor of the man in whose society you may happen to be thrown in the course of your journey this good major m_andrea_cavalcanti is come to take a second view of paris which he only saw in passing through in the time of the empire when he was on his way to moscow
i shall give him a good dinner he will confide his son to my care i will promise to watch over him i shall let him follow in whatever path his folly may lead him and then i shall have done my part â certainly i see you are a model mentor said monsieur_albert good bye we shall return on sunday by the way i have received news of m_franz_de_quesnel â have you is he still amusing himself in italy â i believe so however he regrets your absence extremely he says you were the sun of rome and that without you all appears dark and cloudy i do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains â his opinion of me is altered for the better then â no he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible and mysterious of beings â he is a charming young man said count_of_monte_cristo and i felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction when i met him in search of a supper and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of mine he is i think the son of general dâ pinay â he is â the same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815 â by the bonapartists â_yes really i like him extremely is there not also a matrimonial engagement contemplated for him â_yes he is to marry mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort â indeed 30115m and you know i am to marry mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars said monsieur_albert laughing you smile â_yes â why do you do so â i smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own
but really my dear count we are talking as much of woman as they do of us it is unpardonable monsieur_albert rose are you going â really that is a good idea two hour have i been boring you to death with my company and then you with the greatest politeness ask me if i am going indeed count you are the most polished man in the world and your servant too how very well behaved they are there is quite a style about them monsieur_albert monsieur_baptistin especially i could never get such a man as that my servant seem to imitate those you sometimes see in a play who because they have only a word or two to say aquit themselves in the most awkward manner possible therefore if you part with monsieur_baptistin give me the refusal of him â by all means â that is not all give my compliments to your illustrious luccanese cavalcante of the m_andrea_cavalcanti and if by any chance he should be wishing to establish his son find him a wife very rich very noble on her motherâ side at least and a baroness in right of her father i will help you in the search â ah ha you will do as much as that will you â_yes â well really nothing is certain in this world â_oh count what a service you might render me i should like you a hundred time better if by your intervention i could manage to remain a bachelor even were it only for ten year â nothing is impossible gravely replied count_of_monte_cristo and taking leave of monsieur_albert he returned into the house_of_peers and struck the gong three time monsieur_bertuccio appeared monsieur_albert monsieur_bertuccio you understand that i intend entertaining company on saturday at auteuil monsieur_bertuccio slightly started
â i shall require your services to see that all be properly arranged it is a beautiful house_of_peers or at all events may be made so â there must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title your excellency for the tapestried hangings are very old â let them all be taken away and changed then with the exception of the sleeping chamber which is hung with red damask you will leave that exactly as it is monsieur_bertuccio bowed you will not touch the garden either as to the yard you may do what you please with it i should prefer that being altered beyond all recognition â i will do everything in my power to carry out your wishes your excellency i should be glad however to receive your excellencyâ commands concerning the dinner â really my dear monsieur_bertuccio said the count since you have been in paris you have become quite nervous and apparently out of your element you no longer seem to understand me â but surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive â i do not yet know myself neither is it necessary that you should do so lucullus dines with lucullus that is quite sufficient monsieur_bertuccio bowed and left the room chapter 55 major m_andrea_cavalcanti both the count and monsieur_baptistin had told the truth when they announced to viscount_albert_de_morcerf the proposed visit of the major which had served count_of_monte_cristo as a pretext for declining albertâ invitation seven oâ clock had just struck and monsieur_bertuccio according to the command which had been given him had two hour before left for auteuil when a cab stopped at the door and after depositing its occupant at the gate immediately hurried away as if ashamed of its employment
the visitor was about fifty two year of age dressed in one of the green surtouts ornamented with black frogs which have so long maintained their popularity all over europe he wore trousers of blue cloth boots tolerably clean but not of the brightest polish and a little too thick in the soles buckskin gloves a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes and a black cravat striped with white which if the proprietor had not worn it of his own free will might have passed for a halter so much did it resemble one such was the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate and demanded if it was not at no 30 in the avenue des champs lysã es that the count_of_monte_cristo lived and who being answered by the porter in the affirmative entered closed the gate after him and began to ascend the step the small and angular head of this man his white hair and thick gray moustaches caused him to be easily recognized by monsieur_baptistin who had received an exact description of the expected visitor and who was awaiting him in the hall therefore scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival he was ushered into a simple and elegant drawing room and the count rose to meet him with a smiling air ah my dear sir you are most welcome i was expecting you â indeed said the italian was your excellency then aware of my visit â_yes i had been told that i should see you today at seven oâ clock â then you have received full information concerning my arrival â of course â ah so much the better i feared this little precaution might have been forgotten 30119m
â what precaution â that of informing you beforehand of my coming â_oh no it has not â but you are sure you are not mistaken â very sure â_it really was i whom your excellency expected at seven oâ clock this evening â i will prove it to you beyond a doubt â_oh no never mind that said the italian â_it is not worth the trouble â_yes yes said count_of_monte_cristo his visitor appeared slightly uneasy let me see said the count are you not the marquis bartolomeo_cavalcanti m_andrea_cavalcanti â bartolomeo_cavalcanti m_andrea_cavalcanti joyfully replied the italian â_yes i am really he â ex major in the austrian service â was i a major timidly asked the old soldier â_yes said count_of_monte_cristo you were a major that is the title the french give to the post which you filled in italy â very good said the major i do not demand more you understandâ â your visit here today is not of your own suggestion is it said count_of_monte_cristo no certainly not â you were sent by some other person â_yes â by the excellent abbã_busoni â exactly so said the delighted major and you have a letter â_yes there it is â give it to me then and count_of_monte_cristo took the letter which he opened and read the major looked at the count with his large staring eye and then took a survey of the apartment but his gaze almost immediately reverted to the proprietor of the room â_yes yes i see major m_andrea_cavalcanti a worthy patrician of lucca a descendant of the m_andrea_cavalcanti of florence â continued count_of_monte_cristo reading aloud â possessing an income of half a million â count_of_monte_cristo raised his eye from the paper and bowed half a million said he magnificent â half a million is it said the major
â yes in so many word and it must be so for the abbã knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortune in europe â be it half a million then but on my word of honor i had no idea that it was so much â because you are robbed by your steward you must make some reformation in that quarter â you have opened my eye said the italian gravely i will show the gentlemen the door count_of_monte_cristo resumed the perusal of the letter â and who only needs one thing more to make him happy â â_yes indeed but one said the major with a sigh â which is to recover a lost and adored son â a lost and adored son â stolen away in his infancy either by an enemy of his noble family or by the gypsies â at the age of five year said the major with a deep sigh and raising his eye to heaven unhappy father said count_of_monte_cristo the count continued â i have given him renewed life and hope in the assurance that you have the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for fifteen year â the major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of anxiety i have the power of so doing said count_of_monte_cristo the major recovered his self possession so then said he the letter was true to the end â did you doubt it my dear monsieur_albert bartolomeo_cavalcanti â no indeed certainly not a good man a man holding religious office as does the abbã_busoni could not condescend to deceive or play off a joke but your excellency has not read all â ah true said count_of_monte_cristo there is a postscript â_yes yes repeated the major yesâ thereâ isâ aâ postscript â in order to save major m_andrea_cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker
i send him a draft for 000 franc to defray his travelling expenses and credit on you for the further sum of 48 000 franc which you still owe me â the major awaited the conclusion of the postscript apparently with great anxiety very good said the count he said very good â muttered the major thenâ sirâ â replied he then what asked count_of_monte_cristo then the postscriptâ â well what of the postscript â then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the letter â certainly the abbã_busoni and myself have a small account open between us i do not remember if it is exactly 48 000 franc which i am still owing him but i dare say we shall not dispute the difference you attached great importance then to this postscript my dear monsieur_albert m_andrea_cavalcanti â i must explain to you said the major that fully confiding in the signature of the abbã_busoni i had not provided myself with any other funds so that if this resource had failed me i should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in paris â is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere said count_of_monte_cristo why really i know no one said the major but then you yourself are known to others â_yes i am known so thatâ â proceed my dear monsieur_albert m_andrea_cavalcanti â so that you will remit to me these 48 000 franc â certainly at your first request the majorâ eye dilated with pleasing astonishment but sit down said count_of_monte_cristo really i do not know what i have been thinking ofâ i have positively kept you standing for the last quarter of an hour â donâ mention it the major drew an armchair towards him and proceeded to seat himself
â now said the count what will you takeâ a glass of sherry port or alicante â alicante if you please it is my favorite wine â i have some that is very good you will take a biscuit with it will you not â_yes i will take a biscuit as you are so obliging count_of_monte_cristo rang monsieur_baptistin appeared the count advanced to meet him well said he in a low voice the young man is here said the valet de chambre in the same tone into what room did you take him â into the blue drawing room according to your excellencyâ order â thatâ right now bring the alicante and some biscuits monsieur_baptistin left the room really said the major i am quite ashamed of the trouble i am giving you â pray donâ mention such a thing said the count monsieur_baptistin re entered with glass wine and biscuits the count filled one glass but in the other he only poured a few drops of the ruby colored liquid the bottle was covered with spidersâ webs and all the other signs which indicate the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a manâ face the major made a wise choice he took the full glass and a biscuit the count told monsieur_baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest who began by sipping the alicante with an expression of great satisfaction and then delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine 30123m so sir you lived at lucca did you you were rich noble held in great esteemâ had all that could render a man happy â all said the major hastily swallowing his biscuit positively all â and yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness â only one thing said the italian and
that one thing your lost child â ah said the major taking a second biscuit that consummation of my happiness was indeed wanting the worthy major raised his eye to heaven and sighed let me hear then said the count who this deeply regretted son was for i always understood you were a bachelor â that was the general opinion sir said the major and iâ â â_yes replied the count and you confirmed the report a youthful indiscretion i suppose which you were anxious to conceal from the world at large the major recovered himself and resumed his usual calm manner at the same time casting his eye down either to give himself time to compose his countenance or to assist his imagination all the while giving an under look at the count the protracted smile on whose lip still announced the same polite curiosity â_yes said the major i did wish this fault to be hidden from every eye â not on your own account surely replied count_of_monte_cristo for a man is above that sort of thing â_oh no certainly not on my own account said the major with a smile and a shake of the head but for the sake of the mother said the count â_yes for the motherâ sakeâ his poor mother cried the major taking a third biscuit take some more wine my dear m_andrea_cavalcanti said the count pouring out for him a second glass of alicante your emotion has quite overcome you â his poor mother murmured the major trying to get the lachrymal gland in operation so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false tear
â she belonged to one of the first families in italy i think did she not â she was of a noble family of fiesole count â and her name wasâ â do you desire to know her nameâ â â_oh said count_of_monte_cristo â_it would be quite superfluous for you to tell me for i already know it â the count knows everything said the italian bowing oliva corsinari was it not â oliva corsinari â a marchioness â a marchioness â and you married her at last notwithstanding the opposition of her family â_yes that was the way it ended â and you have doubtless brought all your paper with you said count_of_monte_cristo what paper â the certificate of your marriage with oliva corsinari and the register of your childâ birth â the register of my childâ birth â the register of the birth of m_andrea_cavalcanti cavalcantiâ of your son is not his name m_andrea_cavalcanti â i believe so said the major what you believe so â i dare not positively assert it as he has been lost for so long a time â well then said count_of_monte_cristo you have all the documents with you â your excellency i regret to say that not knowing it was necessary to come provided with these paper i neglected to bring them â that is unfortunate returned count_of_monte_cristo were they then so necessary â they were indispensable the major passed his hand across his brow ah perbacco indispensable were they â certainly they were supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child â true said the major there might be doubts raised â in that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated â_it would be fatal to his interests â_it might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance â peccato
â you must know that in france they are very particular on these points it is not sufficient as in italy to go to the priest and say we love each other and want you to marry us marriage is a civil affair in france and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have paper which undeniably establish your identity â that is the misfortune you see i have not these necessary paper â fortunately i have them though said count_of_monte_cristo you â_yes â you have them â i have them â ah indeed said the major who seeing the object of his journey frustrated by the absence of the paper feared also that his forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the 48 000 francsâ ah indeed that is a fortunate circumstance yes that really is lucky for it never occurred to me to bring them â i do not at all wonder at itâ one cannot think of everything but happily the abbã_busoni thought for you â he is an excellent person â he is extremely prudent and thoughtful â he is an admirable man said the major and he sent them to you â here they are the major clasped his hand in token of admiration you married oliva corsinari in the church of san paolo del monte cattini here is the priestâ certificate â_yes indeed there it is truly said the italian looking on with astonishment and here is m_andrea_cavalcanti cavalcantiâ baptismal register given by the curã of saravezza â all quite correct â take these documents then they do not concern me you will give them to your son who will of course take great care of them â i should think so indeed if he were to lose themâ â well and if he were to lose them said count_of_monte_cristo in
that case replied the major â_it would be necessary to write to the curã for duplicates and it would be some time before they could be obtained â_it would be a difficult matter to arrange said count_of_monte_cristo almost an impossibility replied the major i am very glad to see that you understand the value of these paper â i regard them as invaluable â now said count_of_monte_cristo as to the mother of the young manâ â as to the mother of the young manâ â repeated the italian with anxiety as regards the marchesa corsinariâ â really said the major difficulties seem to thicken upon us will she be wanted in any way â no sir replied count_of_monte_cristo besides has she notâ â â_yes sir said the major she hasâ â 30127m paid the last debt of nature â alas yes returned the italian i knew that said count_of_monte_cristo she has been dead these ten year â and i am still mourning her loss exclaimed the major drawing from his pocket a checked handkerchief and alternately wiping first the left and then the right eye what would you have said count_of_monte_cristo we are all mortal now you understand my dear monsieur_albert m_andrea_cavalcanti that it is useless for you to tell people in france that you have been separated from your son for fifteen year stories of gypsies who steal child are not at all in vogue in this part of the world and would not be believed you sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces and now you wish him to complete his education in the parisian world that is the reason which has induced you to leave via reggio where you have lived since the death of your wife
that will be sufficient â you think so â certainly â very well then â if they should hear of the separationâ â ah yes what could i say â that an unfaithful tutor bought over by the enemies of your familyâ â by the corsinari â precisely had stolen away this child in order that your name might become extinct â that is reasonable since he is an only son â well now that all is arranged do not let these newly awakened remembrances be forgotten you have doubtless already guessed that i was preparing a surprise for you â an agreeable one asked the italian ah i see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his heart â hum said the major someone has told you the secret or perhaps you guessed that he was here â that who was here â your childâ your sonâ your m_andrea_cavalcanti â i did guess it replied the major with the greatest possible coolness then he is here â he is said count_of_monte_cristo when the valet de chambre came in just now he told me of his arrival â ah very well very well said the major clutching the buttons of his coat at each exclamation my dear sir said count_of_monte_cristo i understand your emotion you must have time to recover yourself i will in the meantime go and prepare the young man for this much desired interview for i presume that he is not less impatient for it than yourself â i should quite imagine that to be the case said m_andrea_cavalcanti well in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you â you will bring him then you carry your goodness so far as even to present him to me yourself â no i do not wish to come between a father and son your interview will be private
but do not be uneasy even if the powerful voice of nature should be silent you cannot well mistake him he will enter by this door he is a fine young man of fair complexionâ a little too fair perhapsâ pleasing in manner but you will see and judge for yourself â by the way said the major you know i have only the 000 franc which the abbã_busoni sent me this sum i have expended upon travelling expenses andâ â and you want money that is a matter of course my dear m_andrea_cavalcanti well here are 000 franc on account the majorâ eye sparkled brilliantly â_it is 40 000 franc which i now owe you said count_of_monte_cristo does your excellency wish for a receipt said the major at the same time slipping the money into the inner pocket of his coat for what said the count i thought you might want it to show the abbã_busoni â well when you receive the remaining 40 000 you shall give me a receipt in full between honest man such excessive precaution is i think quite unnecessary â_yes so it is between perfectly upright people â one word more said count_of_monte_cristo say on â you will permit me to make one remark â certainly pray do so â then i should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress â indeed said the major regarding himself with an air of complete satisfaction â_yes it may be worn at via reggio but that costume however elegant in itself has long been out of fashion in paris â thatâ unfortunate â_oh if you really are attached to your old mode of dress you can easily resume it when you leave paris â but what shall i wear â what you find in your trunks â in my trunks i have but
one portmanteau â i dare say you have nothing else with you what is the use of boring oneâ self with so many thing besides an old soldier always likes to march with as little baggage as possible â that is just the caseâ precisely so â but you are a man of foresight and prudence therefore you sent your luggage on before you it has arrived at the hã tel des princes rue de richelieu it is there you are to take up your quarters â then in these trunksâ â i presume you have given order to your valet de chambre to put in all you are likely to need your plain clothes and your uniform on grand occasions you must wear your uniform that will look very well do not forget your crosses they still laugh at them in france and yet always wear them for all that â very well very well said the major who was in ecstasy at the attention paid him by the count now said count_of_monte_cristo that you have fortified yourself against all painful excitement prepare yourself my dear m_andrea_cavalcanti to meet your lost m_andrea_cavalcanti saying which count_of_monte_cristo bowed and disappeared behind the tapestry leaving the major fascinated beyond expression with the delightful reception which he had received at the hand of the count chapter 56 m_andrea_cavalcanti the count_of_monte_cristo entered the adjoining room which monsieur_baptistin had designated as the drawing room and found there a young man of graceful demeanor and elegant appearance who had arrived in a cab about half an hour previously monsieur_baptistin had not found any difficulty in recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for admittance
he was certainly the tall young man with light hair red beard black eye and brilliant complexion whom his master had so particularly described to him when the count entered the room the young man was carelessly stretched on a sofa tapping his boot with the gold headed cane which he held in his hand on perceiving the count he rose quickly the count_of_monte_cristo i believe said he â_yes sir and i think i have the honor of addressing count m_andrea_cavalcanti â count m_andrea_cavalcanti repeated the young man accompanying his word with a bow you are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me are you not said the count i did not mention that because the signature seemed to me so strange â the letter signed sinbad the sailor is it not â exactly so now as i have never known any sinbad with the exception of the one celebrated in the thousand and one night â â well it is one of his descendants and a great friend of mine he is a very rich englishman eccentric almost to insanity and his real name is lord_wilmore â ah indeed then that explains everything that is extraordinary said m_andrea_cavalcanti he is then the same englishman whom i metâ atâ ahâ yes indeed well monsieur_albert i am at your service â if what you say be true replied the count smiling perhaps you will be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your family â certainly i will do so said the young man with a quickness which gave proof of his ready invention i am as you have said the count m_andrea_cavalcanti son of major bartolomeo_cavalcanti m_andrea_cavalcanti a descendant of the m_andrea_cavalcanti whose name are inscribed in the golden book at florence
our family although still rich for my fatherâ income amounts to half a million has experienced many misfortunes and i myself was at the age of five year taken away by the treachery of my tutor so that for fifteen year i have not seen the author of my existence since i have arrived at year of discretion and become my own master i have been constantly seeking him but all in vain at length i received this letter from your friend which states that my father is in paris and authorizes me to address myself to you for information respecting him â really all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting said count_of_monte_cristo observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction and you have done well to conform in everything to the wishes of my friend sinbad for your father is indeed here and is seeking you the count from the moment of first entering the drawing room had not once lost sight of the expression of the young manâ countenance he had admired the assurance of his look and the firmness of his voice but at these word so natural in themselves your father is indeed here and is seeking you young m_andrea_cavalcanti started and exclaimed my father is my father here â most undoubtedly replied count_of_monte_cristo your father major bartolomeo_cavalcanti m_andrea_cavalcanti the expression of terror which for the moment had overspread the features of the young man had now disappeared ah yes that is the name certainly major bartolomeo_cavalcanti m_andrea_cavalcanti and you really mean to say monsieur_albert that my dear father is here â_yes sir and i can even add that i have only just left his company
the history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the quick indeed his griefs hopes and fears on that subject might furnish material for a most touching and pathetic poem at length he one day received a letter stating that the abductors of his son now offered to restore him or at least to give notice where he might be found on condition of receiving a large sum of money by way of ransom your father did not hesitate an instant and the sum was sent to the frontier of piedmont with a passport signed for italy you were in the south of france i think â_yes replied m_andrea_cavalcanti with an embarrassed air i was in the south of france â a carriage was to await you at nice â precisely so and it conveyed me from nice to genoa from genoa to turin from turin to chambã ry from chambã ry to pont de beauvoisin and from pont de beauvoisin to paris 30133m indeed then your father ought to have met with you on the road for it is exactly the same route which he himself took and that is how we have been able to trace your journey to this place â but said m_andrea_cavalcanti if my father had met me i doubt if he would have recognized me i must be somewhat altered since he last saw me â_oh the voice of nature said count_of_monte_cristo
â true interrupted the young man i had not looked upon it in that light â now replied count_of_monte_cristo there is only one source of uneasiness left in your fatherâ mind which is thisâ he is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him how you have been treated by your persecutors and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank finally he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering he wishes to discover if the fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by want of culture and in short whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank entitles you â sir exclaimed the young man quite astounded i hope no false reportâ â as for myself i first heard you spoken of by my friend lord_wilmore the philanthropist i believe he found you in some unpleasant position but do not know of what nature for i did not ask not being inquisitive your misfortunes engaged his sympathies so you see you must have been interesting he told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost and that he would seek your father until he found him he did seek and has found him apparently since he is here now and finally my friend apprised me of your coming and gave me a few other instructions relative to your future fortune
i am quite aware that my friend lord_wilmore is peculiar but he is sincere and as rich as a gold mine consequently he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their ruining him and i have promised to adhere to his instructions now sir pray do not be offended at the question i am about to put to you as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron i would wish to know if the misfortunes which have happened to youâ misfortunes entirely beyond your control and which in no degree diminish my regard for youâ i would wish to know if they have not in some measure contributed to render you a stranger to the world in which your fortune and your name entitle you to make a conspicuous figure â sir returned the young man with a reassurance of manner make your mind easy on this score those who took me from my father and who always intended sooner or later to sell me again to my original proprietor as they have now done calculated that in order to make the most of their bargain it would be politic to leave me in possession of all my personal and hereditary worth and even to increase the value if possible i have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in asia minor whose masters made them grammarians doctors and philosophers in order that they might fetch a higher price in the roman market count_of_monte_cristo smiled with satisfaction it appeared as if he had not expected so much from m_andrea_cavalcanti
â besides continued the young man if there did appear some defect in education or offence against the established forms of etiquette i suppose it would be excused in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth and followed me through my youth â well said count_of_monte_cristo in an indifferent tone you will do as you please count for you are the master of your own actions and are the person most concerned in the matter but if i were you i would not divulge a word of these adventures your history is quite a romance and the world which delights in romances in yellow covers strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment even though they be gilded like yourself this is the kind of difficulty which i wished to represent to you my dear count you would hardly have recited your touching history before it would go forth to the world and be deemed unlikely and unnatural you would be no longer a lost child found but you would be looked upon as an upstart who had sprung up like a mushroom in the night you might excite a little curiosity but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant remark â i agree with you monsieur_albert said the young man turning pale and in spite of himself trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion such consequences would be extremely unpleasant â nevertheless you must not exaggerate the evil said count_of_monte_cristo for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another
you must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct and for a man of your intelligence this plan is as easy as it is necessary you must form honorable friendships and by that means counteract the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former life m_andrea_cavalcanti visibly changed countenance i would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser said count_of_monte_cristo did i not possess a moral distrust of my best friend and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too therefore in departing from this rule i should as the actors say be playing a part quite out of my line and should therefore run the risk of being hissed which would be an act of folly â however your excellency said m_andrea_cavalcanti in consideration of lord_wilmore by whom i was recommended to youâ â â_yes certainly interrupted count_of_monte_cristo but lord_wilmore did not omit to inform me my dear m_andrea_cavalcanti that the season of your youth was rather a stormy one ah said the count watching andreaâ countenance i do not demand any confession from you it is precisely to avoid that necessity that your father was sent for from lucca you shall soon see him he is a little stiff and pompous in his manner and he is disfigured by his uniform but when it becomes known that he has been for eighteen year in the austrian service all that will be pardoned we are not generally very severe with the austrians
in short you will find your father a very presentable person i assure you â ah sir you have given me confidence it is so long since we were separated that i have not the least remembrance of him and besides you know that in the eye of the world a large fortune covers all defects â he is a millionaireâ his income is 500 000 franc â then said the young man with anxiety i shall be sure to be placed in an agreeable position â one of the most agreeable possible my dear sir he will allow you an income of 50 000 livres per annum during the whole time of your stay in paris â then in that case i shall always choose to remain there â you cannot control circumstances my dear sir man proposes and god disposes â m_andrea_cavalcanti sighed but said he so long as i do remain in paris and nothing forces me to quit it do you mean to tell me that i may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me â you may â shall i receive it from my father asked m_andrea_cavalcanti with some uneasiness â_yes you will receive it from your father personally but lord_wilmore will be the security for the money he has at the request of your father opened an account of 000 franc a month at danglarsâ which is one of the safest banks in paris â and does my father mean to remain long in paris asked m_andrea_cavalcanti only a few day replied count_of_monte_cristo his service does not allow him to absent himself more than two or three weeks together â ah my dear father exclaimed m_andrea_cavalcanti evidently charmed with the idea of his speedy departure therefore said count_of_monte_cristo feigning to mistake his meaningâ therefore
i will not for another instant retard the pleasure of your meeting are you prepared to embrace your worthy father â i hope you do not doubt it 30137m go then into the drawing room my young friend where you will find your father awaiting you m_andrea_cavalcanti made a low bow to the count and entered the adjoining room count_of_monte_cristo watched him till he disappeared and then touched a spring in a panel made to look like a picture which in sliding partly from the frame discovered to view a small opening so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was passing in the drawing room now occupied by m_andrea_cavalcanti and m_andrea_cavalcanti the young man closed the door behind him and advanced towards the major who had risen when he heard step approaching him ah my dear father said m_andrea_cavalcanti in a loud voice in order that the count might hear him in the next room is it really you â how do you do my dear son said the major gravely after so many year of painful separation said m_andrea_cavalcanti in the same tone of voice and glancing towards the door what a happiness it is to meet again â indeed it is after so long a separation â will you not embrace me sir said m_andrea_cavalcanti 30139 â if you wish it my son said the major and the two man embraced each other after the fashion of actors on the stage that is to say each rested his head on the otherâ shoulder then we are once more reunited said m_andrea_cavalcanti once more replied the major never more to be separated â why as to thatâ i think my dear son you must be by this time so accustomed to france as to look upon it almost as a second country
â the fact is said the young man that i should be exceedingly grieved to leave it â as for me you must know i cannot possibly live out of lucca therefore i shall return to italy as soon as i can â but before you leave france my dear father i hope you will put me in possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my descent â certainly i am come expressly on that account it has cost me much trouble to find you but i had resolved on giving them into your hand and if i had to recommence my search it would occupy all the few remaining year of my life â where are these paper then â here they are m_andrea_cavalcanti seized the certificate of his fatherâ marriage and his own baptismal register and after having opened them with all the eagerness which might be expected under the circumstances he read them with a facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents and with an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the contents when he had perused the documents an indefinable expression of pleasure lighted up his countenance and looking at the major with a most peculiar smile he said in very excellent tuscan then there is no longer any such thing in italy as being condemned to the galleys the major drew himself up to his full height why what do you mean by that question â i mean that if there were it would be impossible to draw up with impunity two such deeds as these in france my dear sir half such a piece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to toulon for five year for change of air â will
you be good enough to explain your meaning said the major endeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest majesty my dear m_andrea_cavalcanti said m_andrea_cavalcanti taking the major by the arm in a confidential manner how much are you paid for being my father the major was about to speak when m_andrea_cavalcanti continued in a low voice nonsense i am going to set you an example of confidence they give me 50 000 franc a year to be your son consequently you can understand that it is not at all likely i shall ever deny my parent the major looked anxiously around him make yourself easy we are quite alone said m_andrea_cavalcanti besides we are conversing in italian â well then replied the major they paid me 50 000 franc down â monsieur_albert m_andrea_cavalcanti said m_andrea_cavalcanti do you believe in fairy tales â i used not to do so but i really feel now almost obliged to have faith in them â you have then been induced to alter your opinion you have had some proofs of their truth the major drew from his pocket a handful of gold most palpable proofs said he as you may perceive â you think then that i may rely on the countâ promises â certainly i do â you are sure he will keep his word with me â to the letter but at the same time remember we must continue to play our respective part i as a tender fatherâ â and i as a dutiful son as they choose that i shall be descended from you â whom do you mean by they â ma foi i can hardly tell but i was alluding to those who wrote the letter you received one did you not â_yes â from whom â from
a certain abbã_busoni â have you any knowledge of him â no i have never seen him â what did he say in the letter â you will promise not to betray me â rest assured of that you well know that our interests are the same â then read for yourself and the major gave a letter into the young manâ hand m_andrea_cavalcanti read in a low voice â you are poor a miserable old age awaits you would you like to become rich or at least independent set out immediately for paris and demand of the count_of_monte_cristo avenue des champs lysã es no 30 the son whom you had by the marchesa corsinari and who was taken from you at five year of age this son is named m_andrea_cavalcanti in order that you may not doubt the kind intention of the writer of this letter you will find enclosed an order for 400 franc payable in florence at signor gozziâ also a letter of introduction to the count_of_monte_cristo on whom i give you a draft of 48 000 franc remember to go to the count on the 26th may at seven oâ clock in the evening signed abbã_busoni â â_it is the same â what do you mean said the major i was going to say that i received a letter almost to the same effect â you â_yes â from the abbã_busoni â no â from whom then â from an englishman called lord_wilmore who takes the name of sinbad the sailor â and of whom you have no more knowledge than i of the abbã_busoni â you are mistaken there i am ahead of
you â you have seen him then â_yes once â where â ah that is just what i cannot tell you if i did i should make you as wise as myself which it is not my intention to do â and what did the letter contain â read it â you are poor and your future prospects are dark and gloomy do you wish for a name should you like to be rich and your own master â parbleu said the young man was it possible there could be two answers to such a question â take the post chaise which you will find waiting at the porte de gãªnes as you enter nice pass through turin chambã ry and pont de beauvoisin go to the count_of_monte_cristo avenue des champs lysã es on the 26th of may at seven oâ clock in the evening and demand of him your father you are the son of the marchese m_andrea_cavalcanti and the marchesa oliva corsinari the marquis will give you some paper which will certify this fact and authorize you to appear under that name in the parisian world as to your rank an annual income of 50 000 livres will enable you to support it admirably i enclose a draft for 000 livres payable on ferrea banker at nice and also a letter of introduction to the count_of_monte_cristo whom i have directed to supply all your wants â sinbad the sailor â humph said the major very good you have seen the count you say â i have only just left him â and has he conformed to all that the letter specified â he has â do you understand it â not in the least â there is a dupe somewhere â at
all events it is neither you nor i â certainly not â well thenâ â why it does not much concern us do you think it does â no i agree with you there we must play the game to the end and consent to be blindfolded â ah you shall see i promise you i will sustain my part to admiration â i never once doubted your doing so count_of_monte_cristo chose this moment for re entering the drawing room on hearing the sound of his footsteps the two man threw themselves in each otherâ arm and while they were in the midst of this embrace the count entered well marquis said count_of_monte_cristo you appear to be in no way disappointed in the son whom your good fortune has restored to you â ah your excellency i am overwhelmed with delight â and what are your feelings said count_of_monte_cristo turning to the young man as for me my heart is overflowing with happiness â happy father happy son said the count there is only one thing which grieves me observed the major and that is the necessity for my leaving paris so soon â ah my dear m_andrea_cavalcanti i trust you will not leave before i have had the honor of presenting you to some of my friend â i am at your service sir replied the major now sir said count_of_monte_cristo addressing m_andrea_cavalcanti make your confession â to whom â tell m_andrea_cavalcanti something of the state of your finances â ma foi monsieur_albert you have touched upon a tender chord â do you hear what he says major â certainly i do â but do you understand â i do â your son says he requires money â well what would you have me do said the major you should furnish him with some of course replied count_of_monte_cristo
â i â_yes you said the count at the same time advancing towards m_andrea_cavalcanti and slipping a packet of bank notes into the young manâ hand what is this â_it is from your father â from my father â_yes did you not tell him just now that you wanted money well then he deputes me to give you this â am i to consider this as part of my income on account â no it is for the first expenses of your settling in paris â ah how good my dear father is â silence said count_of_monte_cristo he does not wish you to know that it comes from him â i fully appreciate his delicacy said m_andrea_cavalcanti cramming the notes hastily into his pocket and now gentlemen i wish you good morning said count_of_monte_cristo and when shall we have the honor of seeing you again your excellency asked m_andrea_cavalcanti ah said m_andrea_cavalcanti when may we hope for that pleasure â on saturday if you willâ yes let me seeâ saturdayâ i am to dine at my country house_of_peers at auteuil on that day rue de la fontaine no 28 several person are invited and among others mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars your banker i will introduce you to him for it will be necessary he should know you as he is to pay your money â full dress said the major half aloud â_oh yes certainly said the count uniform cross knee breeches â and how shall i be dressed demanded m_andrea_cavalcanti 30145m â_oh very simply black trousers patent leather boots white waistcoat either a black or blue coat and a long cravat go to blin or vã ronique for your clothes monsieur_baptistin will tell you where if you do not know their address the less pretension there is in your attire the better will be the effect as you are a rich man
if you mean to buy any horse get them of devedeux and if you purchase a phaeton go to baptiste for it â at what hour shall we come asked the young man about half past six â we will be with you at that time said the major the two m_andrea_cavalcanti bowed to the count and left the house_of_peers count_of_monte_cristo went to the window and saw them crossing the street arm in arm there go two miscreants said he â_it is a pity they are not really related then after an instant of gloomy reflection come i will go to see the morrels said he i think that disgust is even more sickening than hatred 30147m chapter 57 in the lucern patch our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure surrounding de villefortâ house_of_peers and behind the gate half screened from view by the large chestnut trees which on all side spread their luxuriant branches we shall find some people of our acquaintance this time m_maximilian_morrel was the first to arrive he was intently watching for a shadow to appear among the trees and awaiting with anxiety the sound of a light step on the gravel walk at length the long desired sound was heard and instead of one figure as he had expected he perceived that two were approaching him the delay had been occasioned by a visit from madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars which had been prolonged beyond the time at which mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort was expected that she might not appear to fail in her promise to m_maximilian_morrel she proposed to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars that they should take a walk in the garden being anxious to show that the delay which was doubtless a cause of vexation to him was not occasioned by any neglect on her part
the young man with the intuitive perception of a lover quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily placed and he was comforted besides although she avoided coming within speaking distance mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort arranged so that m_maximilian_morrel could see her pass and repass and each time she went by she managed unperceived by her companion to cast an expressive look at the young man which seemed to say have patience you see it is not my fault and m_maximilian_morrel was patient and employed himself in mentally contrasting the two girl one fair with soft languishing eye a figure gracefully bending like a weeping willow the other a brunette with a fierce and haughty expression and as straight as a poplar it is unnecessary to state that in the eye of the young man mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort did not suffer by the contrast in about half an hour the girl went away and m_maximilian_morrel understood that mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars danglarsâ visit had at last come to an end in a few minute mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort re entered the garden alone for fear that anyone should be observing her return she walked slowly and instead of immediately directing her step towards the gate she seated herself on a bench and carefully casting her eye around to convince herself that she was not watched she presently arose and proceeded quickly to join m_maximilian_morrel good evening mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said a well known voice good evening m_maximilian_morrel i know i have kept you waiting but you saw the cause of my delay â_yes i recognized mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i was not aware that you were so intimate with her â who told you we were intimate m_maximilian_morrel â no one but you appeared to be so
from the manner in which you walked and talked together one would have thought you were two school girl telling your secrets to each other â we were having a confidential conversation returned mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with de viscount_albert_de_morcerf and i on the other hand was confessing to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying dâ pinay â dear mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â that will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed between me and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars as in speaking of the man whom i could not love my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were fixed â ah how good you are to say so mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort you possess a quality which can never belong to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars it is that indefinable charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek â_it is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light â no mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort i assure you such is not the case i was observing you both when you were walking in the garden and on my honor without at all wishing to depreciate the beauty of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i cannot understand how any man can really love her â the fact is m_maximilian_morrel that i was there and my presence had the effect of rendering you unjust in your comparison â no but tell meâ it is a question of simple curiosity and which was suggested by certain idea passing in my mind relative to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars danglarsâ â i dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to say it only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex interrupted mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort
â you cannot at least deny that you are very harsh judges of each other â if we are so it is because we generally judge under the influence of excitement but return to your question 30151m does mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars object to this marriage with de viscount_albert_de_morcerf on account of loving another â i told you i was not on terms of strict intimacy with mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â_yes but girl tell each other secrets without being particularly intimate own now that you did question her on the subject ah i see you are smiling â if you are already aware of the conversation that passed the wooden partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight security â come what did she say â she told me that she loved no one said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort that she disliked the idea of being married that she would infinitely prefer leading an independent and unfettered life and that she almost wished her father might lose his fortune that she might become an artist like her friend mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly dâ armilly â ah you seeâ â well what does that prove asked mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort nothing replied m_maximilian_morrel then why did you smile â why you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â do you want me to go away â ah no no but do not let us lose time you are the subject on which i wish to speak â true we must be quick for we have scarcely ten minute more to pass together â ma foi said m_maximilian_morrel in consternation â_yes you are right i am but a poor friend to you what a life i cause you to lead poor m_maximilian_morrel you who are formed for happiness
i bitterly reproach myself i assure you â well what does it signify mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort so long as i am satisfied and feel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five minute of your society or two word from your lip and i have also a deep conviction that heaven would not have created two heart harmonizing as ours do and almost miraculously brought us together to separate us at last â those are kind and cheering word you must hope for us both m_maximilian_morrel that will make me at least partly happy â but why must you leave me so soon â i do not know particulars i can only tell you that madame m_noirtier_de_villefort sent to request my presence as she had a communication to make on which a part of my fortune depended let them take my fortune i am already too rich and perhaps when they have taken it they will leave me in peace and quietness you would love me as much if i were poor would you not m_maximilian_morrel â_oh i shall always love you what should i care for either riches or poverty if my mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort was near me and i felt certain that no one could deprive me of her but do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage â i do not think that is the case â however it may be mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort you must not be alarmed i assure you that as long as i live i shall never love anyone else â do you think to reassure me when you say that m_maximilian_morrel â pardon me you are right i am a brute but i was going to tell you that i met de morcerf
the other day â well â monsieur_albert m_franz_de_quesnel is his friend you know â what then â monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf has received a letter from m_franz_de_quesnel announcing his immediate return mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort turned pale and leaned her hand against the gate ah heavens if it were that but no the communication would not come through madame m_noirtier_de_villefort â why not â becauseâ i scarcely know whyâ but it has appeared as if madame m_noirtier_de_villefort secretly objected to the marriage although she did not choose openly to oppose it â is it so then i feel as if i could adore madame m_noirtier_de_villefort â do not be in such a hurry to do that said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort with a sad smile if she objects to your marrying dâ pinay she would be all the more likely to listen to any other proposition â no m_maximilian_morrel it is not suitors to which madame m_noirtier_de_villefort objects it is marriage itself â marriage if she dislikes that so much why did she ever marry herself â you do not understand me m_maximilian_morrel about a year ago i talked of retiring to a convent madame m_noirtier_de_villefort in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty to make secretly approved of the proposition my father consented to it at her instigation and it was only on account of my poor grandfather that i finally abandoned the project you can form no idea of the expression of that old manâ eye when he look at me the only person in the world whom he loves and i had almost said by whom he is beloved in return when he learned my resolution i shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on me and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his lifeless cheeks
ah m_maximilian_morrel i experienced at that moment such remorse for my intention that throwing myself at his foot i exclaimed â forgive me pray forgive me my dear grandfather they may do what they will with me i will never leave you when i had ceased speaking he thankfully raised his eye to heaven but without uttering a word ah m_maximilian_morrel i may have much to suffer but i feel as if my grandfatherâ look at that moment would more than compensate for all â dear mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort you are a perfect angel and i am sure i do not know what iâ sabring right and left among the bedouinsâ can have done to merit your being revealed to me unless indeed heaven took into consideration the fact that the victims of my sword were infidels but tell me what interest madame m_noirtier_de_villefort can have in your remaining unmarried â did i not tell you just now that i was rich maximilianâ too rich i possess nearly 50 000 livres in right of my mother my grandfather and my grandmother the marquis and marquise de madame_de_saint_mã_ran will leave me as much and m_noirtier_de_villefort evidently intends making me his heir my brother edward who inherits nothing from his mother will therefore be poor in comparison with me now if i had taken the veil all this fortune would have descended to my father and in reversion to his son â ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avaricious â_it is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal love â but could you not compromise matters and give up a portion of your fortune to her son â how
could i make such a proposition especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested â mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort i have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred consequently i have covered it with the veil of respect and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul no human being not even my sister is aware of its existence mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort will you permit me to make a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love i bear you mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort started a friend m_maximilian_morrel and who is this friend i tremble to give my permission â listen mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort have you never experienced for anyone that sudden and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had been your old and familiar friend though in reality it was the first time you had ever met nay further have you never endeavored to recall the time place and circumstances of your former intercourse and failing in this attempt have almost believed that your spirits must have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to the present and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the past â_yes â well that is precisely the feeling which i experienced when i first saw that extraordinary man â extraordinary did you say â_yes â you have known him for some time then â scarcely longer than eight or ten day â and do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten day ah m_maximilian_morrel i had hoped you set a higher value on the title of friend â your logic is most powerful mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort but say what you will i can never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession of my mind
i feel as if it were ordained that this man should be associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to come and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according to his own will â he must be a prophet then said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort smiling indeed said m_maximilian_morrel i have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy at all events he has a wonderful power of foretelling any future good â ah said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort in a mournful tone do let me see this man m_maximilian_morrel he may tell me whether i shall ever be loved sufficiently to make amends for all i have suffered â my poor girl you know him already â i know him â_yes it was he who saved the life of your step mother and her son â the count_of_monte_cristo â the same â ah cried mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort he is too much the friend of madame m_noirtier_de_villefort ever to be mine â the friend of madame m_noirtier_de_villefort it cannot be surely mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort you are mistaken â no indeed i am not for i assure you his power over our household is almost unlimited courted by my step mother who regards him as the epitome of human wisdom admired by my father who says he has never before heard such sublime idea so eloquently expressed idolized by edward who notwithstanding his fear of the countâ large black eye runs to meet him the moment he arrives and opens his hand in which he is sure to find some delightful present m de count_of_monte_cristo appears to exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all the members of our family â if
such be the case my dear mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort you must yourself have felt or at all events will soon feel the effects of his presence he meets monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf in italyâ it is to rescue him from the hand of the banditti he introduces himself to madame danglarsâ it is that he may give her a royal present your step mother and her son pass before his doorâ it is that his nubian may save them from destruction this man evidently possesses the power of influencing events both as regards man and thing i never saw more simple tastes united to greater magnificence his smile is so sweet when he addresses me that i forget it ever can be bitter to others ah mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort tell me if he ever looked on you with one of those sweet smile if so depend on it you will be happy â me said the young girl he never even glances at me on the contrary if i accidentally cross his path he appears rather to avoid me ah he is not generous neither does he possess that supernatural penetration which you attribute to him for if he did he would have perceived that i was unhappy and if he had been generous seeing me sad and solitary he would have used his influence to my advantage and since as you say he resembles the sun he would have warmed my heart with one of his life giving rays you say he loves you m_maximilian_morrel how do you know that he does all would pay deference to an officer like you with a fierce moustache and a long sabre but they think they may crush a poor weeping girl with impunity â ah mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort i assure you you are mistaken â if it were otherwiseâ if he treated me
diplomaticallyâ that is to say like a man who wishes by some means or other to obtain a footing in the house_of_peers so that he may ultimately gain the power of dictating to its occupantsâ he would if it had been but once have honored me with the smile which you extol so loudly but no he saw that i was unhappy he understood that i could be of no use to him and therefore paid no attention to me whatever who knows but that in order to please madame m_noirtier_de_villefort and my father he may not persecute me by every means in his power it is not just that he should despise me so without any reason ah forgive me said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort perceiving the effect which her word were producing on m_maximilian_morrel i have done wrong for i have given utterance to thoughts concerning that man which i did not even know existed in my heart i do not deny the influence of which you speak or that i have not myself experienced it but with me it has been productive of evil rather than good â well mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said m_maximilian_morrel with a sigh we will not discuss the matter further i will not make a confidant of him â alas said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort i see that i have given you pain i can only say how sincerely i ask pardon for having grieved you but indeed i am not prejudiced beyond the power of conviction tell me what this count_of_monte_cristo has done for you 30157m i own that your question embarrasses me mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort for i cannot say that the count has rendered me any ostensible service
still as i have already told you i have an instinctive affection for him the source of which i cannot explain to you has the sun done anything for me no he warms me with his rays and it is by his light that i see youâ nothing more has such and such a perfume done anything for me no its odor charms one of my sensesâ that is all i can say when i am asked why i praise it my friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his for me a secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship in his most simple actions as well as in his most secret thoughts i find a relation to my own you will perhaps smile at me when i tell you that ever since i have known this man i have involuntarily entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated from him however i have managed to live thirty year without this protection you will say but i will endeavor a little to illustrate my meaning he invited me to dine with him on saturday which was a very natural thing for him to do well what have i learned since that your mother and m_noirtier_de_villefort are both coming to this dinner i shall meet them there and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview this may appear to you to be no unusual combination of circumstances nevertheless i perceive some hidden plot in the arrangementâ something in fact more than is apparent on a casual view of the subject
i believe that this singular man who appears to fathom the motives of everyone has purposely arranged for me to meet and madame m_noirtier_de_villefort and sometimes i confess i have gone so far as to try to read in his eye whether he was in possession of the secret of our love â my good friend said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort i should take you for a visionary and should tremble for your reason if i were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to this is it possible that you can see anything more than the merest chance in this meeting pray reflect a little my father who never goes out has several time been on the point of refusing this invitation madame m_noirtier_de_villefort on the contrary is burning with the desire of seeing this extraordinary nabob in his own house_of_peers therefore she has with great difficulty prevailed on my father to accompany her no no it is as i have said m_maximilian_morrel there is no one in the world of whom i can ask help but yourself and my grandfather who is little better than a corpseâ no support to cling to but my mother in heaven â i see that you are right logically speaking said m_maximilian_morrel but the gentle voice which usually has such power over me fails to convince me today â i feel the same as regards yourself said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and i own that if you have no stronger proof to give meâ â i have another replied m_maximilian_morrel but i fear you will deem it even more absurd than the first â so much the worse said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort smiling â_it is nevertheless conclusive to my mind
my ten year of service have also confirmed my idea on the subject of sudden inspirations for i have several time owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed me to move at once either to the right or to the left in order to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side while it left me unharmed â dear m_maximilian_morrel why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers for your safety when you are away i no longer pray for myself but for you 30159m â_yes since you have known me said m_maximilian_morrel smiling but that cannot apply to the time previous to our acquaintance mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â you are very provoking and will not give me credit for anything but let me hear this second proof which you yourself own to be absurd â well look through this opening and you will see the beautiful new horse which i rode here â ah what a beautiful creature cried mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort why did you not bring him close to the gate so that i could talk to him and pat him â he is as you see a very valuable animal said m_maximilian_morrel you know that my means are limited and that i am what would be designated a man of moderate pretensions well i went to a horse dealerâ where i saw this magnificent horse which i have named mã dã ah i asked the price they told me it was 500 franc i was therefore obliged to give it up as you may imagine but i own i went away with rather a heavy heart for the horse had looked at me affectionately had rubbed his head against me and when i mounted him had pranced in the most delightful way imaginable so that i was altogether fascinated with him
the same evening some friend of mine visited me m de baron_de_chã_teau_renaud m_lucien_debray and five or six other choice spirits whom you do not know even by name they proposed a game of bouillotte i never play for i am not rich enough to afford to lose or sufficiently poor to desire to gain but i was at my own house_of_peers you understand so there was nothing to be done but to send for the cards which i did just as they were sitting down to table de count_of_monte_cristo arrived he took his seat amongst them they played and i won i am almost ashamed to say that my gains amounted to 000 franc we separated at midnight i could not defer my pleasure so i took a cabriolet and drove to the horse dealerâ feverish and excited i rang at the door the person who opened it must have taken me for a madman for i rushed at once to the stable mã dã ah was standing at the rack eating his hay i immediately put on the saddle and bridle to which operation he lent himself with the best grace possible then putting the 500 franc into the hand of the astonished dealer i proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing the night in riding in the champs lysã es as i rode by the countâ house_of_peers i perceived a light in one of the window and fancied i saw the shadow of his figure moving behind the curtain now mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort i firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring him â my dear m_maximilian_morrel you are really too fanciful you will not love even me long
a man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common every day sort of attachment such as ours but they are calling me do you hear â ah mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said m_maximilian_morrel give me but one finger through this opening in the grating one finger the littlest finger of all that i may have the happiness of kissing it â m_maximilian_morrel we said we would be to each other as two voice two shadows â as you will mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â shall you be happy if i do what you wish â_oh yes mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort mounted on a bench and passed not only her finger but her whole hand through the opening m_maximilian_morrel uttered a cry of delight and springing forwards seized the hand extended towards him and imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss the little hand was then immediately withdrawn and the young man saw mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort hurrying towards the house_of_peers as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations chapter 58 m_noirtier_de_villefort we will now relate what was passing in the house_of_peers of the kingâ attorney after the departure of madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and her daughter and during the time of the conversation between m_maximilian_morrel and mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort which we have just detailed m_noirtier_de_villefort entered his fatherâ room followed by madame m_noirtier_de_villefort both of the visitors after saluting the old man and speaking to barrois a faithful servant who had been twenty five year in his service took their place on either side of the paralytic m_noirtier_de_villefort was sitting in an armchair which moved upon casters in which he was wheeled into the room in the morning and in the same way drawn out again at night
he was placed before a large glass which reflected the whole apartment and so without any attempt to move which would have been impossible he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around him m_noirtier_de_villefort although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the new comers with a quick and intelligent expression perceiving at once by their ceremonious courtesy that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character sight and hearing were the only senses remaining and they like two solitary sparks remained to animate the miserable body which seemed fit for nothing but the grave it was only however by means of one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied his mind and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees by night across some desert place and knows that a living being dwells beyond the silence and obscurity noirtierâ hair was long and white and flowed over his shoulders while in his eye shaded by thick black lashes was concentrated as it often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the others all the activity address force and intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole body and so although the movement of the arm the sound of the voice and the agility of the body were wanting the speaking eye sufficed for all he commanded with it it was the medium through which his thanks were conveyed
in short his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eye and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs while the rest of the rigid and marble like features were utterly deprived of the power of participation three person only could understand this language of the poor paralytic these were m_noirtier_de_villefort mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and the old servant of whom we have already spoken but as m_noirtier_de_villefort saw his father but seldom and then only when absolutely obliged and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there all the old manâ happiness was centred in his granddaughter mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort by means of her love her patience and her devotion had learned to read in noirtierâ look all the varied feelings which were passing in his mind to this dumb language which was so unintelligible to others she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid whose body could scarcely be called a living one but who nevertheless possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort had solved the problem and was able easily to understand his thoughts and to convey her own in return and through her untiring and devoted assiduity it was seldom that in the ordinary transactions of every day life she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living thinking mind or the wants of the almost inanimate body
as to the servant he had as we have said been with his master for five and twenty year therefore he knew all his habits and it was seldom that m_noirtier_de_villefort found it necessary to ask for anything so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid m_noirtier_de_villefort did not need the help of either mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort or the domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was about to begin as we have said he perfectly understood the old manâ vocabulary and if he did not use it more often it was only indifference and ennui which prevented him from so doing he therefore allowed mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort to go into the garden sent away barrois and after having seated himself at his fatherâ right hand while madame m_noirtier_de_villefort placed herself on the left he addressed him thus i trust you will not be displeased sir that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort has not come with us or that i dismissed barrois for our conference will be one which could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either madame m_noirtier_de_villefort and i have a communication to make to you noirtierâ face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble while on the contrary villefortâ eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old manâ heart this communication continued the procureur in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion will we are sure meet with your approbation the eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind he listened nothing more sir resumed m_noirtier_de_villefort we are thinking of marrying mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort
had the old manâ face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there the marriage will take place in less than three month said m_noirtier_de_villefort noirtierâ eye still retained its inanimate expression madame m_noirtier_de_villefort now took her part in the conversation and added we thought this news would possess an interest for you sir who have always entertained a great affection for mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined it is one of the most desirable connections which could possibly be formed he possesses fortune a high rank in society and every personal qualification likely to render mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort supremely happy his name moreover cannot be wholly unknown to you it is m_franz_de_quesnel baron dâ pinay while his wife was speaking m_noirtier_de_villefort had narrowly watched the old manâ countenance when madame m_noirtier_de_villefort pronounced the name of m_franz_de_quesnel the pupil of noirtierâ eye began to dilate and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lip of an individual about to speak and he darted a lightning glance at madame m_noirtier_de_villefort and his son the procureur who knew the political hatred which had formerly existed between m_noirtier_de_villefort and the elder dâ pinay well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced but feigning not to perceive either he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his wife sir said he you are aware that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort is about to enter her nineteenth year which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance
nevertheless you have not been forgotten in our plans and we have fully ascertained beforehand that valentineâ future husband will consent not to live in this house_of_peers for that might not be pleasant for the young people but that you should live with them so that you and mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort who are so attached to each other would not be separated and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done and thus instead of losing you will be a gainer by the change as it will secure to you two child instead of one to watch over and comfort you 30165m noirtierâ look was furious it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old manâ mind for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat and not being able to find vent in utterance appeared almost to choke him for his face and lip turned quite purple with the struggle m_noirtier_de_villefort quietly opened a window saying â_it is very warm and the heat affects m_noirtier_de_villefort he then returned to his place but did not sit down this marriage added madame m_noirtier_de_villefort
â is quite agreeable to the wishes of dâ pinay and his family besides he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt his mother having died at his birth and his father having been assassinated in 1815 that is to say when he was but two year old it naturally followed that the child was permitted to choose his own pursuits and he has therefore seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his own will â that assassination was a mysterious affair said m_noirtier_de_villefort and the perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection although suspicion has fallen on the head of more than one person m_noirtier_de_villefort made such an effort that his lip expanded into a smile now continued m_noirtier_de_villefort those to whom the guilt really belongs by whom the crime was committed on whose head the justice of man may probably descend here and the certain judgment of god hereafter would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peace offering as mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly destroyed m_noirtier_de_villefort had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame â_yes i understand was the reply contained in his look and this look expressed a feeling of strong indignation mixed with profound contempt m_noirtier_de_villefort fully understood his fatherâ meaning and answered by a slight shrug of his shoulders he then motioned to his wife to take leave now sir said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort i must bid you farewell would you like me to send edward to you for a short time
it had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by closing his eye his refusal by winking them several time and if he had some desire or feeling to express he raised them to heaven if he wanted mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort he closed his right eye only and if barrois the left at madame de villefortâ proposition he instantly winked his eye provoked by a complete refusal she bit her lip and said then shall i send mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort to you the old man closed his eye eagerly thereby intimating that such was his wish and madame m_noirtier_de_villefort bowed and left the room giving order that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort should be summoned to her grandfatherâ presence and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort with a color still heightened by emotion entered the room just after her parents had quitted it one look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather was suffering and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing to communicate to her dear grandpapa cried she what has happened they have vexed you and you are angry the paralytic closed his eye in token of assent who has displeased you is it my father â no â madame m_noirtier_de_villefort â no â me the former sign was repeated are you displeased with me cried mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort in astonishment m_noirtier_de_villefort again closed his eye and what have i done dear grandpapa that you should be angry with me cried mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort there was no answer and she continued i have not seen you all day has anyone been speaking to you against me â_yes said the old manâ look with eagerness let me think a moment
i do assure you grandpapaâ ahâ and madame m_noirtier_de_villefort have just left this room have they not â_yes â and it was they who told you something which made you angry what was it then may i go and ask them that i may have the opportunity of making my peace with you â no no said noirtierâ look ah you frighten me what can they have said and she again tried to think what it could be ah i know said she lowering her voice and going close to the old man they have been speaking of my marriage have they not â_yes replied the angry look i understand you are displeased at the silence i have preserved on the subject the reason of it was that they had insisted on my keeping the matter a secret and begged me not to tell you anything of it they did not even acquaint me with their intentions and i only discovered them by chance that is why i have been so reserved with you dear grandpapa pray forgive me but there was no look calculated to reassure her all it seemed to say was â_it is not only your reserve which afflicts me â what is it then asked the young girl perhaps you think i shall abandon you dear grandpapa and that i shall forget you when i am married â no â they told you then that dâ pinay consented to our all living together â_yes â then why are you still vexed and grieved the old manâ eye beamed with an expression of gentle affection â_yes i understand said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â_it is because you love me the old man assented and you are afraid i shall be unhappy â_yes â you do not like m_franz_de_quesnel the eye repeated several time no no no
â then you are vexed with the engagement â_yes â well listen said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort throwing herself on her knees and putting her arm round her grandfatherâ neck i am vexed too for i do not love m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay an expression of intense joy illumined the old manâ eye when i wished to retire into a convent you remember how angry you were with me a tear trembled in the eye of the invalid well continued mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort the reason of my proposing it was that i might escape this hateful marriage which drives me to despair noirtierâ breathing came thick and short then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too ah if you could but help meâ if we could both together defeat their plan but you are unable to oppose them you whose mind is so quick and whose will is so firm are nevertheless as weak and unequal to the contest as i am myself alas you who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the day of your health and strength can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows without being able to take any active part in them however this is much and calls for gratitude and heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness at these word there appeared in noirtierâ eye an expression of such deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these word there you are mistaken i can still do much for you â do you think you can help me dear grandpapa said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â_yes m_noirtier_de_villefort raised his eye it was the sign agreed on between him and mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort when he wanted anything
â what is it you want dear grandpapa said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and she endeavored to recall to mind all the thing which he would be likely to need and as the idea presented themselves to her mind she repeated them aloud then finding that all her efforts elicited nothing but a constant no â she said come since this plan does not answer i will have recourse to another she then recited all the letter of the alphabet from a down to when she arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she had spoken the initial letter of the thing he wanted ah said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort the thing you desire begins with the letter it is with that we have to do then well let me see what can you want that begins with naâ neâ niâ noâ â â_yes yes yes said the old manâ eye ah it is no then â_yes mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort fetched a dictionary which she placed on a desk before m_noirtier_de_villefort she opened it and seeing that the old manâ eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages she ran her finger quickly up and down the columns during the six year which had passed since m_noirtier_de_villefort first fell into this sad state valentineâ powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old manâ meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted at the word notary m_noirtier_de_villefort made a sign to her to stop
30169m notary said she do you want a notary dear grandpapa the old man again signified that it was a notary he desired you would wish a notary to be sent for then said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â_yes â shall my father be informed of your wish â_yes â do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately â_yes â then they shall go for him directly dear grandpapa is that all you want â_yes mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell monsieur_albert or madame m_noirtier_de_villefort that they were requested to come to noirtierâ room are you satisfied now inquired mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â_yes â i am sure you are it is not very difficult to discover that and the young girl smiled on her grandfather as if he had been a child m_noirtier_de_villefort entered followed by barrois what do you want me for sir demanded he of the paralytic sir said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort my grandfather wishes for a notary at this strange and unexpected demand m_noirtier_de_villefort and his father exchanged look â_yes motioned the latter with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and his old servant who both knew what his wishes were he was quite prepared to maintain the contest do you wish for a notary asked m_noirtier_de_villefort â_yes â what to do m_noirtier_de_villefort made no answer what do you want with a notary again repeated m_noirtier_de_villefort the invalidâ eye remained fixed by which expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable is it to do us some ill turn do you think it is worth while said m_noirtier_de_villefort still said barrois with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant if m_noirtier_de_villefort asks for a notary
i suppose he really wishes for a notary therefore i shall go at once and fetch one barrois acknowledged no master but m_noirtier_de_villefort and never allowed his desires in any way to be contradicted 30171m â_yes i do want a notary motioned the old man shutting his eye with a look of defiance which seemed to say and i should like to see the person who dares to refuse my request â you shall have a notary as you absolutely wish for one sir said m_noirtier_de_villefort but i shall explain to him your state of health and make excuses for you for the scene cannot fail of being a most ridiculous one â never mind that said barrois i shall go and fetch a notary nevertheless and the old servant departed triumphantly on his mission chapter 59 the will as soon as barrois had left the room m_noirtier_de_villefort looked at mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort with a malicious expression that said many thing the young girl perfectly understood the look and so did m_noirtier_de_villefort for his countenance became clouded and he knitted his eyebrows angrily he took a seat and quietly awaited the arrival of the notary m_noirtier_de_villefort saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference at the same time giving a side look at mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room three quarters of an hour after barrois returned bringing the notary with him sir said m_noirtier_de_villefort after the first salutations were over you were sent for by m_noirtier_de_villefort whom you see here all his limbs have become completely paralysed he has lost his voice also and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his meaning m_noirtier_de_villefort cast an appealing look on mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort which look
was at once so earnest and imperative that she answered immediately sir said she i perfectly understand my grandfatherâ meaning at all time â that is quite true said barrois and that is what i told the gentleman as we walked along â permit me said the notary turning first to m_noirtier_de_villefort and then to valentineâ permit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself cannot proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility the first thing necessary to render an act valid is that the notary should be thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and wishes of the person dictating the act now i cannot be sure of the approbation or disapprobation of a client who cannot speak and as the object of his desire or his repugnance cannot be clearly proved to me on account of his want of speech my services here would be quite useless and cannot be legally exercised the notary then prepared to retire an imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lip of the procureur m_noirtier_de_villefort looked at mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort with an expression so full of grief that she arrested the departure of the notary sir said she the language which i speak with my grandfather may be easily learnt and i can teach you in a few minute to understand it almost as well as i can myself will you tell me what you require in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject â in order to render an act valid i must be certain of the approbation or disapprobation of my client
illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite â well sir by the help of two signs with which i will acquaint you presently you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties m_noirtier_de_villefort being deprived of voice and motion is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eye when he wishes to signify â_yes and to wink when he means no you now know quite enough to enable you to converse with m_noirtier_de_villefort try m_noirtier_de_villefort gave mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary himself you have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying sir have you asked the notary m_noirtier_de_villefort closed his eye and you approve of what she saidâ that is to say you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts â_yes â_it was you who sent for me â_yes â to make your will â_yes â and you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original intentions the old man winked violently well sir said the young girl do you understand now and is your conscience perfectly at rest on the subject but before the notary could answer m_noirtier_de_villefort had drawn him aside
â sir said he do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock such as m_noirtier_de_villefort has received without any detriment to his mental faculties â_it is not exactly that sir said the notary which makes me uneasy but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions so as to be able to get his answers â you must see that to be an utter impossibility said m_noirtier_de_villefort mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and the old man heard this conversation and m_noirtier_de_villefort fixed his eye so earnestly on mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort that she felt bound to answer to the look sir said she that need not make you uneasy however difficult it may at first sight appear to be i can discover and explain to you my grandfatherâ thoughts so as to put an end to all your doubts and fears on the subject i have now been six year with m_noirtier_de_villefort and let him tell you if ever once during that time he has entertained a thought which he was unable to make me understand â no signed the old man let us try what we can do then said the notary you accept this young lady as your interpreter m_noirtier_de_villefort â_yes â well sir what do you require of me and what document is it that you wish to be drawn up mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort named all the letter of the alphabet until she came to at this letter the eloquent eye of m_noirtier_de_villefort gave her notice that she was to stop â_it is very evident that it is the letter which m_noirtier_de_villefort wants said the notary wait said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and turning to her grandfather she repeated waâ weâ wiâ â the old man stopped her at the last syllable
valentine then took the dictionary and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages she passed her finger slowly down the columns and when she came to the word will m noirtierâ eye bade her stop will said the notary â_it is very evident that m_noirtier_de_villefort is desirous of making his will â_yes yes yes motioned the invalid really sir you must allow that this is most extraordinary said the astonished notary turning to m_noirtier_de_villefort â_yes said the procureur and i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary for i cannot see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and she may perhaps be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and ill defined wishes of her grandfather â no no no replied the eye of the paralytic what said m_noirtier_de_villefort do you mean to say that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort is not interested in your will â no â sir said the notary whose interest had been greatly excited and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this extraordinary and picturesque scene what appeared so impossible to me an hour ago has now become quite easy and practicable and this may be a perfectly valid will provided it be read in the presence of seven witnesses approved by the testator and sealed by the notary in the presence of the witnesses as to the time it will not require very much more than the generality of wills there are certain forms necessary to be gone through and which are always the same
as to the details the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find the affairs of the testator and by yourself who having had the management of them can doubtless give full information on the subject but besides all this in order that the instrument may not be contested i am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity therefore one of my colleagues will help me and contrary to custom will assist in the dictation of the testament are you satisfied sir continued the notary addressing the old man 30175 â_yes looked the invalid his eye beaming with delight at the ready interpretation of his meaning what is he going to do thought m_noirtier_de_villefort whose position demanded much reserve but who was longing to know what his fatherâ intentions were he left the room to give order for another notary to be sent but barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his masterâ wishes and had already gone to fetch one the procureur then told his wife to come up in the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had assembled in the chamber of the paralytic the second notary had also arrived a few word sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the law they read to m_noirtier_de_villefort the formal copy of a will in order to give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are generally couched then in order to test the capacity of the testator the first notary said turning towards him when an individual makes his will it is generally in favor or in prejudice of some person â_yes â have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune
â yes â i will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation you will stop me when i reach the one representing the amount of your own possessions â_yes there was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now and if it was not a sublime it was at least a curious spectacle they had formed a circle round the invalid the second notary was sitting at a table prepared for writing and his colleague was standing before the testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we have alluded your fortune exceeds 300 000 franc does it not asked he m_noirtier_de_villefort made a sign that it did do you possess 400 000 franc inquired the notary noirtierâ eye remained immovable 500 000 the same expression continued 600 000â 700 000â 800 000â 900 000 m_noirtier_de_villefort stopped him at the last named sum you are then in possession of 900 000 franc asked the notary â_yes â in landed property â no â in stock â_yes â the stock is in your own hand the look which m_noirtier_de_villefort cast on barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to find the old servant left the room and presently returned bringing with him a small casket do you permit us to open this casket asked the notary m_noirtier_de_villefort gave his assent they opened it and found 900 000 franc in bank scrip the first notary handed over each note as he examined it to his colleague the total amount was found to be as m_noirtier_de_villefort had stated â_it is all as he has said it is very evident that the mind still retains its full force and vigor then turning towards the paralytic he said
â you possess then 900 000 franc of capital which according to the manner in which you have invested it ought to bring in an income of about 40 000 livres â_yes â to whom do you desire to leave this fortune â_oh said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort there is not much doubt on that subject m_noirtier_de_villefort tenderly loves his granddaughter mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort it is she who has nursed and tended him for six year and has by her devoted attention fully secured the affection i had almost said the gratitude of her grandfather and it is but just that she should reap the fruit of her devotion the eye of m_noirtier_de_villefort clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by madame de villefortâ word and manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain is it then to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort m_noirtier_de_villefort that you leave these 900 000 franc demanded the notary thinking he had only to insert this clause but waiting first for the assent of m_noirtier_de_villefort which it was necessary should be given before all the witnesses of this singular scene mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort when her name was made the subject of discussion had stepped back to escape unpleasant observation her eye were cast down and she was crying the old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest tenderness then turning towards the notary he significantly winked his eye in token of dissent what said the notary do you not intend making mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort m_noirtier_de_villefort your residuary legatee â no â you are not making any mistake are you said the notary you really mean to declare that such is not your intention â no repeated m_noirtier_de_villefort no mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort raised her head struck dumb with astonishment
it was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act but m_noirtier_de_villefort looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed â_oh grandpapa i see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me you still leave me the love which i have always enjoyed â ah yes most assuredly said the eye of the paralytic for he closed them with an expression which mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort could not mistake thank you thank you murmured she the old manâ declaration that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of madame m_noirtier_de_villefort she gradually approached the invalid and said then doubtless dear m_noirtier_de_villefort you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson edward m_noirtier_de_villefort the winking of the eye which answered this speech was most decided and terrible and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred no said the notary then perhaps it is to your son m_noirtier_de_villefort â no the two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the testator m_noirtier_de_villefort and his wife both grew red one from shame the other from anger what have we all done then dear grandpapa said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort you no longer seem to love any of us the old manâ eye passed rapidly from m_noirtier_de_villefort and his wife and rested on mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort with a look of unutterable fondness well said she if you love me grandpapa try and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present moment
you know me well enough to be quite sure that i have never thought of your fortune besides they say i am already rich in right of my motherâ too rich even explain yourself then m_noirtier_de_villefort fixed his intelligent eye on valentineâ hand my hand said she â_yes â her hand exclaimed everyone â_oh gentlemen you see it is all useless and that my fatherâ mind is really impaired said m_noirtier_de_villefort ah cried mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort suddenly i understand it is my marriage you mean is it not dear grandpapa â_yes yes yes signed the paralytic casting on mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort a look of joyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning 30179m you are angry with us all on account of this marriage are you not â_yes â really this is too absurd said m_noirtier_de_villefort excuse me sir replied the notary on the contrary the meaning of m_noirtier_de_villefort is quite evident to me and i can quite easily connect the train of idea passing in his mind â you do not wish me to marry m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay observed mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort i do not wish it said the eye of her grandfather and you disinherit your granddaughter continued the notary because she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes â_yes â so that but for this marriage she would have been your heir â_yes there was a profound silence the two notaries were holding a consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense gratitude and m_noirtier_de_villefort was biting his lip with vexation while madame m_noirtier_de_villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward feeling of joy which in spite of herself appeared in her whole countenance
â but said m_noirtier_de_villefort who was the first to break the silence i consider that i am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in question i am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughterâ hand it is my wish that she should marry m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinayâ and she shall marry him mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort sank weeping into a chair sir said the notary how do you intend disposing of your fortune in case mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort still determines on marrying m_franz_de_quesnel the old man gave no answer you will of course dispose of it in some way or other â_yes â in favor of some member of your family â no â do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes then pursued the notary â_yes â but said the notary you are aware that the law does not allow a son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony â_yes â you only intend then to dispose of that part of your fortune which the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son m_noirtier_de_villefort made no answer do you still wish to dispose of all â_yes â but they will contest the will after your death â no â my father knows me replied m_noirtier_de_villefort he is quite sure that his wishes will be held sacred by me besides he understands that in my position i cannot plead against the poor the eye of m_noirtier_de_villefort beamed with triumph what do you decide on sir asked the notary of m_noirtier_de_villefort nothing sir it is a resolution which my father has taken and i know he never alters his mind i am quite resigned
these 900 000 franc will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man and i shall therefore act according to my conscience having said this m_noirtier_de_villefort quitted the room with his wife leaving his father at liberty to do as he pleased the same day the will was made the witnesses were brought it was approved by the old man sealed in the presence of all and given in charge to deschamps the family notary chapter 60 the telegraph and madame m_noirtier_de_villefort found on their return that the count_of_monte_cristo who had come to visit them in their absence had been ushered into the drawing room and was still awaiting them there madame m_noirtier_de_villefort who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately retired to her bedroom while the procureur who could better depend upon himself proceeded at once to the salon although m_noirtier_de_villefort flattered himself that to all outward view he had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind he did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow so much so that the count whose smile was radiant immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful air ma foi said count_of_monte_cristo after the first compliments were over what is the matter with you m_noirtier_de_villefort have i arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime m_noirtier_de_villefort tried to smile no count he replied i am the only victim in this case
it is i who lose my cause and it is ill luck obstinacy and folly which have caused it to be decided against me â to what do you refer said count_of_monte_cristo with well feigned interest have you really met with some great misfortune â_oh no monsieur_albert said m_noirtier_de_villefort with a bitter smile â_it is only a loss of money which i have sustainedâ nothing worth mentioning i assure you â true said count_of_monte_cristo the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess and to one of your philosophic spirit â_it is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me said m_noirtier_de_villefort though after all 900 000 franc are worth regretting but i am the more annoyed with this fate chance or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune and may blast the prospects of my child also as it is all occasioned by an old man relapsed into second childhood 30183m what do you say said the count 900 000 franc it is indeed a sum which might be regretted even by a philosopher and who is the cause of all this annoyance â my father as i told you â m_noirtier_de_villefort but i thought you told me he had become entirely paralyzed and that all his faculties were completely destroyed â_yes his bodily faculties for he can neither move nor speak nevertheless he thinks acts and wills in the manner i have described i left him about five minute ago and he is now occupied in dictating his will to two notaries â but to do this he must have spoken â he has done better than thatâ he has made himself understood â how was such a thing possible â by
the help of his eye which are still full of life and as you perceive possess the power of inflicting mortal injury â my dear said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort who had just entered the room perhaps you exaggerate the evil â good morning madame said the count bowing madame m_noirtier_de_villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most gracious smile what is this that m_noirtier_de_villefort has been telling me demanded count_of_monte_cristo and what incomprehensible misfortuneâ â incomprehensible is the word interrupted the procureur shrugging his shoulders â_it is an old manâ caprice â and is there no means of making him revoke his decision â_yes said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort and it is still entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will which is now in prejudice of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort to be altered in her favor the count who perceived that and madame m_noirtier_de_villefort were beginning to speak in parables appeared to pay no attention to the conversation and feigned to be busily engaged in watching edward who was mischievously pouring some ink into the birdâ water glass my dear said m_noirtier_de_villefort in answer to his wife you know i have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family nor have i ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my nod nevertheless it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which i have entertained for so many year
the baron dâ pinay was my friend as you know and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be arranged â do you think said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort is in league with him she has always been opposed to this marriage and i should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but the execution of a plan concerted between them â madame said m_noirtier_de_villefort believe me a fortune of 900 000 franc is not so easily renounced â she could nevertheless make up her mind to renounce the world sir since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a convent â never mind replied m_noirtier_de_villefort i say that this marriage shall be consummated â notwithstanding your fatherâ wishes to the contrary said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort selecting a new point of attack that is a serious thing count_of_monte_cristo who pretended not to be listening heard however every word that was said 30185m madame replied m_noirtier_de_villefort i can truly say that i have always entertained a high respect for my father because to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority the name of father is sacred in two senses he should be reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to obey but under the present circumstances i am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who because he hated the father vents his anger on the son it would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such caprices
i shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward m_noirtier_de_villefort i will suffer without complaint the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me but i shall remain firm in my determination and the world shall see which party has reason on his side consequently i shall marry my daughter to the baron m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay because i consider it would be a proper and eligible match for her to make and in short because i choose to bestow my daughterâ hand on whomever i please â what said the count the approbation of whose eye m_noirtier_de_villefort had frequently solicited during this speech what do you say that m_noirtier_de_villefort disinherits mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort because she is going to marry le baron m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay â_yes sir that is the reason said m_noirtier_de_villefort shrugging his shoulders the apparent reason at least said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort the real reason madame i can assure you i know my father â but i want to know in what way dâ pinay can have displeased your father more than any other person â i believe i know m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay said the count is he not the son of general m_franz_de_quesnel who was created baron dâ pinay by charles â the same said m_noirtier_de_villefort well but he is a charming young man according to my idea â he is which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of m_noirtier_de_villefort to prevent his granddaughter marrying old man are always so selfish in their affection said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort but said count_of_monte_cristo do you not know any cause for this hatred â ah ma foi who is to know â perhaps it is some political difference â my father and the baron dâ pinay lived in the stormy time of which i only saw the ending said m_noirtier_de_villefort
â was not your father a bonapartist asked count_of_monte_cristo i think i remember that you told me something of that kind â my father has been a jacobin more than anything else said m_noirtier_de_villefort carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence and the senatorâ robe which napoleon cast on his shoulders only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him when my father conspired it was not for the emperor it was against the bourbons for m_noirtier_de_villefort possessed this peculiarity he never projected any utopian schemes which could never be realized but strove for possibilities and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the mountain theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result â well said count_of_monte_cristo â_it is just as i thought it was politics which brought m_noirtier_de_villefort and dâ pinay into personal contact although general dâ pinay served under napoleon did he not still retain royalist sentiments and was he not the person who was assassinated one evening on leaving a bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited on the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor m_noirtier_de_villefort looked at the count almost with terror am i mistaken then said count_of_monte_cristo no sir the facts were precisely what you have stated said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that m_noirtier_de_villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two child of these inveterate enemies â_it was a sublime and charitable thought said count_of_monte_cristo and the whole world should applaud it
it would be noble to see mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort assuming the title of madame m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay m_noirtier_de_villefort shuddered and looked at count_of_monte_cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the word he had just uttered but the count completely baffled the procureur and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the never varying smile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming although said m_noirtier_de_villefort â_it will be a serious thing for mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort to lose her grandfatherâ fortune i do not think that dâ pinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss he will perhaps hold me in greater esteem than the money itself seeing that i sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with him besides he knows that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort is rich in right of her mother and that she will in all probability inherit the fortune of and madame_de_saint_mã_ran her motherâ parents who both love her tenderly â and who are fully as well worth loving and tending as m_noirtier_de_villefort said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort besides they are to come to paris in about a month and mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort after the affront she has received need not consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up with m_noirtier_de_villefort the count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded self love and defeated ambition but
it seems to me said count_of_monte_cristo and i must begin by asking your pardon for what i am about to say that if m_noirtier_de_villefort disinherits mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested he cannot have the same cause of complaint against this dear edward â true said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort with an intonation of voice which it is impossible to describe is it not unjustâ shamefully unjust poor edward is as much noirtierâ grandchild as mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and yet if she had not been going to marry m_franz_de_quesnel m_noirtier_de_villefort would have left her all his money and supposing mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort to be disinherited by her grandfather she will still be three time richer than he the count listened and said no more count said m_noirtier_de_villefort we will not entertain you any longer with our family misfortunes it is true that my patrimony will go to endow charitable institutions and my father will have deprived me of my lawful inheritance without any reason for doing so but i shall have the satisfaction of knowing that i have acted like a man of sense and feeling dâ pinay to whom i had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if i endure the most cruel privations â however said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to dâ pinay in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort â ah that would be a great pity said m_noirtier_de_villefort a great pity said count_of_monte_cristo
â undoubtedly said m_noirtier_de_villefort moderating the tone of his voice a marriage once concerted and then broken off throws a sort of discredit on a young lady then again the old reports which i was so anxious to put an end to will instantly gain ground no it will all go well dâ pinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice but that is impossible â i agree with m_noirtier_de_villefort said count_of_monte_cristo fixing his eye on madame m_noirtier_de_villefort and if i were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice i would persuade him since i have been told dâ pinay is coming back to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation i will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on m_noirtier_de_villefort the procureur arose delighted with the proposition but his wife slightly changed color well that is all that i wanted and i will be guided by a counsellor such as you are said he extending his hand to count_of_monte_cristo
â therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not happened and as though we had never thought of such a thing as a change in our original plans â sir said the count the world unjust as it is will be pleased with your resolution your friend will be proud of you and dâ pinay even if he took mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort without any dowry which he will not do would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty at the conclusion of these word the count rose to depart are you going to leave us count said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort i am sorry to say i must do so madame i only came to remind you of your promise for saturday â did you fear that we should forget it â you are very good madame but m_noirtier_de_villefort has so many important and urgent occupations â my husband has given me his word sir said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort you have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything to gain â and said m_noirtier_de_villefort is it at your house_of_peers in the champs lysã es that you receive your visitors â no said count_of_monte_cristo which is precisely the reason which renders your kindness more meritorious â_it is in the country â in the country â_yes â where is it then near paris is it not â very near only half a league from the barriers â_it is at auteuil â at auteuil said m_noirtier_de_villefort true madame m_noirtier_de_villefort told me you lived at auteuil since it was to your house_of_peers that she was taken
and in what part of auteuil do you reside â rue de la fontaine â rue de la fontaine exclaimed m_noirtier_de_villefort in an agitated tone at what number â no 28 â then cried m_noirtier_de_villefort was it you who bought de saint mã ranâ house_of_peers â did it belong to de madame_de_saint_mã_ran demanded count_of_monte_cristo â_yes replied madame m_noirtier_de_villefort and would you believe it countâ â believe what â you think this house_of_peers pretty do you not â i think it charming â well my husband would never live in it â indeed returned count_of_monte_cristo that is a prejudice on your part m_noirtier_de_villefort for which i am quite at a loss to account â i do not like auteuil sir said the procureur making an evident effort to appear calm but i hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of the pleasure of your company sir said count_of_monte_cristo no count i hopeâ i assure you i shall do my best stammered m_noirtier_de_villefort â_oh said count_of_monte_cristo i allow of no excuse on saturday at six oâ clock i shall be expecting you and if you fail to come i shall thinkâ for how do i know to the contrary that this house_of_peers which has remained uninhabited for twenty year must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with it â i will come count i will be sure to come said m_noirtier_de_villefort eagerly thank you said count_of_monte_cristo now you must permit me to take my leave of you â you
said before that you were obliged to leave us monsieur_albert said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort and you were about to tell us why when your attention was called to some other subject â indeed madame said count_of_monte_cristo i scarcely know if i dare tell you where i am going â nonsense say on â well then it is to see a thing on which i have sometimes mused for hour together â what is it â a telegraph so now i have told my secret â a telegraph repeated madame m_noirtier_de_villefort â_yes a telegraph i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock and in the light of the sun its black arm bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the idea and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message i began to think of genii sylphs gnomes in short of all the ministers of the occult sciences until i laughed aloud at the freaks of my own imagination now it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects with their long black claws for i always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals factions and government intrigues
but one fine day i learned that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch hired for twelve hundred franc a year and employed all day not in studying the heavens like an astronomer or in gazing on the water like an angler or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him but all his monotonous life was passed in watching his white bellied black clawed fellow insect four or five leagues distant from him at length i felt a desire to study this living chrysalis more closely and to endeavor to understand the secret part played by these insect actors when they occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of string 30191m and are you going there â i am â what telegraph do you intend visiting that of the home department or of the observatory â_oh no i should find there people who would force me to understand thing of which i would prefer to remain ignorant and who would try to explain to me in spite of myself a mystery which even they do not understand ma foi i should wish to keep my illusions concerning insects unimpaired it is quite enough to have those dissipated which i had formed of my fellow creatures i shall therefore not visit either of these telegraphs but one in the open country where i shall find a good natured simpleton who knows no more than the machine he is employed to work â you are a singular man said m_noirtier_de_villefort what line would you advise me to study â the one that is most in use just at this time â the
spanish one you mean i suppose â_yes should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain to youâ â no said count_of_monte_cristo since as i told you before i do not wish to comprehend it the moment i understand it there will no longer exist a telegraph for me it will be nothing more than a sign from duchã tel or from montalivet transmitted to the prefect of bayonne mystified by two greek word tãªle graphein it is the insect with black claws and the awful word which i wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its importance â go then for in the course of two hour it will be dark and you will not be able to see anything â ma foi you frighten me which is the nearest way bayonne â_yes the road to bayonne â and afterwards the road to chã tillon â_yes â by the tower of montlhã ry you mean â_yes â thank you good bye on saturday i will tell you my impressions concerning the telegraph at the door the count was met by the two notaries who had just completed the act which was to disinherit mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not fail of redounding considerably to their credit chapter 61 how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches not on the same night as he had stated but the next morning the count_of_monte_cristo went out by the barriã re dâ enfer taking the road to orlã ans
leaving the village of linas without stopping at the telegraph which flourished its great bony arm as he passed the count reached the tower of montlhã ry situated as everyone knows upon the highest point of the plain of that name at the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path about eighteen inches wide when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white flowers count_of_monte_cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure and was not long in finding a little wooden gate working on willow hinges and fastened with a nail and string the count soon mastered the mechanism the gate opened and he then found himself in a little garden about twenty foot long by twelve wide bounded on one side by part of the hedge which contained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate and on the other by the old tower covered with ivy and studded with wall flowers no one would have thought in looking at this old weather beaten floral decked tower which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed up to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast that it would have been capable of telling strange thing if in addition to the menacing ears which the proverb says all wall are provided with â_it had also a voice the garden was crossed by a path of red gravel edged by a border of thick box of many yearsâ growth and of a tone and color that would have delighted the heart of delacroix our modern rubens this path was formed in the shape of the figure of thus in its windings making a walk of sixty foot in a garden of only twenty
never had flora the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners been honored with a purer or more scrupulous worship than that which was paid to her in this little enclosure in fact of the twenty rose trees which formed the parterre not one bore the mark of the slug nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp soil and yet it was not because the damp had been excluded from the garden the earth black as soot the thick foliage of the trees betrayed its presence besides had natural humidity been wanting it could have been immediately supplied by artificial means thanks to a tank of water sunk in one of the corners of the garden and upon which were stationed a frog and a toad who from antipathy no doubt always remained on the two opposite side of the basin there was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths or a weed in the flower bed no fine lady ever trained and watered her geraniums her cacti and her rhododendrons in her porcelain jardiniã re with more pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure count_of_monte_cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to the nail and cast a look around the man at the telegraph said he must either engage a gardener or devote himself passionately to agriculture suddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with leaves the something rose uttering an exclamation of astonishment and count_of_monte_cristo found himself facing a man about fifty year old who was plucking strawberries which he was placing upon grape leaves
he had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries which on rising suddenly he let fall from his hand you are gathering your crop sir said count_of_monte_cristo smiling 30193m excuse me sir replied the man raising his hand to his cap i am not up there i know but i have only just come down â do not let me interfere with you in anything my friend said the count gather your strawberries if indeed there are any left â i have ten left said the man for here are eleven and i had twenty one five more than last year but i am not surprised the spring has been warm this year and strawberries require heat sir this is the reason that instead of the sixteen i had last year i have this year you see eleven already pluckedâ twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen ah i miss three they were here last night sirâ i am sure they were hereâ i counted them it must be the son of mã re simon who has stolen them i saw him strolling about here this morning ah the young rascalâ stealing in a gardenâ he does not know where that may lead him to â certainly it is wrong said count_of_monte_cristo but you should take into consideration the youth and greediness of the delinquent â of course said the gardener but that does not make it the less unpleasant but sir once more i beg pardon perhaps you are an officer that i am detaining here and he glanced timidly at the countâ blue coat 30197m calm yourself my friend said the count with the smile which he made at will either terrible or benevolent and which now expressed only the kindliest feeling i am not an inspector but a traveller brought here by a curiosity
he half repents of since he causes you to lose your time â ah my time is not valuable replied the man with a melancholy smile still it belongs to government and i ought not to waste it but having received the signal that i might rest for an hourâ here he glanced at the sun dial for there was everything in the enclosure of montlhã ry even a sun dial and having ten minute before me and my strawberries being ripe when a day longerâ by the by sir do you think dormice eat them â indeed i should think not replied count_of_monte_cristo dormice are bad neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved as the romans did â what did the romans eat them said the gardenerâ ate dormice â i have read so in petronius said the count really they canâ be nice though they do say as fat as a dormouse â_it is not a wonder they are fat sleeping all day and only waking to eat all night listen last year i had four apricotsâ they stole one i had one nectarine only oneâ well sir they ate half of it on the wall a splendid nectarineâ i never ate a better â you ate it â that is to say the half that was leftâ you understand it was exquisite sir ah those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels like mã re simonâ son who has not chosen the worst strawberries but this year continued the horticulturist iâ ll take care it shall not happen even if i should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch when the strawberries are ripe count_of_monte_cristo had seen enough every man has a devouring passion in his heart as every fruit has its worm that of the telegraph man was horticulture
he began gathering the grape leaves which screened the sun from the grapes and won the heart of the gardener did you come here sir to see the telegraph he said â_yes if it isnâ contrary to the rules â_oh no said the gardener not in the least since there is no danger that anyone can possibly understand what we are saying â i have been told said the count that you do not always yourselves understand the signals you repeat â that is true sir and that is what i like best said the man smiling why do you like that best â because then i have no responsibility i am a machine then and nothing else and so long as i work nothing more is required of me â is it possible said count_of_monte_cristo to himself that i can have met with a man that has no ambition that would spoil my plans â sir said the gardener glancing at the sun dial the ten minute are almost up i must return to my post will you go up with me â i follow you count_of_monte_cristo entered the tower which was divided into three stories the tower contained implements such as spades rakes watering pots hung against the wall this was all the furniture the second was the manâ conventional abode or rather sleeping place it contained a few poor articles of household furnitureâ a bed a table two chairs a stone pitcherâ and some dry herbs hung up to the ceiling which the count recognized as sweet peas and of which the good man was preserving the seeds he had labelled them with as much care as if he had been master botanist in the jardin des plantes does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing asked count_of_monte_cristo
â the study does not take long it was acting as a supernumerary that was so tedious â and what is the pay â a thousand franc sir â_it is nothing â no but then we are lodged as you perceive count_of_monte_cristo looked at the room they passed to the third story it was the telegraph room count_of_monte_cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles by which the machine was worked â_it is very interesting he said but it must be very tedious for a lifetime â_yes at first my neck was cramped with looking at it but at the end of a year i became used to it and then we have our hour of recreation and our holidays â holidays â_yes â when â when we have a fog â ah to be sure â those are indeed holidays to me i go into the garden i plant i prune i trim i kill the insects all day long â how long have you been here â ten year and five as a supernumerary make fifteen â you areâ â fifty five year old â how long must you have served to claim the pension â_oh sir twenty five year â and how much is the pension â a hundred crowns â poor humanity murmured count_of_monte_cristo what did you say sir asked the man i was saying it was very interesting â what was â all you were showing me and you really understand none of these signals â none at all â and have you never tried to understand them â never why should i â but still there are some signals only addressed to you â certainly â and do you understand them â they are always the same â and they meanâ â â nothing new you have an hour or
tomorrow â this is simple enough said the count but look is not your correspondent putting itself in motion â ah yes thank you sir â and what is it sayingâ anything you understand â_yes it asks if i am ready â and you reply â by the same sign which at the same time tells my right hand correspondent that i am ready while it gives notice to my left hand correspondent to prepare in his turn â_it is very ingenious said the count you will see said the man proudly in five minute he will speak â i have then five minute said count_of_monte_cristo to himself â_it is more time than i require my dear sir will you allow me to ask you a question â what is it sir â you are fond of gardening â passionately â and you would be pleased to have instead of this terrace of twenty foot an enclosure of two acres â sir i should make a terrestrial paradise of it â you live badly on your thousand franc â badly enough but yet i do live â_yes but you have a wretchedly small garden â true the garden is not large â and then such as it is it is filled with dormice who eat everything â ah they are my scourges â tell me should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your right hand correspondent was telegraphingâ â i should not see him â then what would happen â i could not repeat the signals â and then â not having repeated them through negligence i should be fined â how much â a hundred franc â the tenth of your incomeâ that would be fine work â ah said the man has it ever happened to you said count_of_monte_cristo
â once sir when i was grafting a rose tree â well suppose you were to alter a signal and substitute another â ah that is another case i should be turned off and lose my pension â three hundred franc â a hundred crowns yes sir so you see that i am not likely to do any of these thing â not even for fifteen yearsâ wages come it is worth thinking about â for fifteen thousand franc â_yes â sir you alarm me â nonsense â sir you are tempting me â just so fifteen thousand franc do you understand â sir let me see my right hand correspondent â on the contrary do not look at him but at this â what is it â what do you not know these bits of paper â bank notes â exactly there are fifteen of them â and whose are they â yours if you like â mine exclaimed the man half suffocated â_yes yoursâ your own property â sir my right hand correspondent is signalling â let him signal â sir you have distracted me i shall be fined â that will cost you a hundred franc you see it is your interest to take my bank notes â sir my right hand correspondent redoubles his signals he is impatient â never mindâ take these and the count placed the packet in the manâ hand now this is not all he said you cannot live upon your fifteen thousand franc â i shall still have my place â no you will lose it for you are going to alter your correspondentâ message â_oh sir what are you proposing â a jest â sir unless you force meâ â i think i can effectually force you and count_of_monte_cristo drew another packet from his pocket here are ten thousand more franc he said with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket they will make twenty five thousand
with five thousand you can buy a pretty little house_of_peers with two acres of land the remaining twenty thousand will bring you in a thousand franc a year â a garden with two acres of land â and a thousand franc a year â_oh heavens â come take them and count_of_monte_cristo forced the bank notes into his hand what am i to do â nothing very difficult â but what is it â to repeat these signs count_of_monte_cristo took a paper from his pocket upon which were drawn three signs with numbers to indicate the order in which they were to be worked there you see it will not take long â_yes butâ â do this and you will have nectarines and all the rest the shot told red with fever while the large drops fell from his brow the man executed one after the other the three signs given by the count in spite of the frightful contortions of the right hand correspondent who not understanding the change began to think the gardener had gone mad as to the left hand one he conscientiously repeated the same signals which were finally transmitted to the minister of the interior now you are rich said count_of_monte_cristo â_yes replied the man but at what a price â listen friend said count_of_monte_cristo i do not wish to cause you any remorse believe me then when i swear to you that you have wronged no man but on the contrary have benefited mankind the man looked at the bank notes felt them counted them turned pale then red then rushed into his room to drink a glass of water but he had no time to reach the water jug and fainted in the midst of his dried herbs
five minute after the new telegram reached the minister m_lucien_debray had the horse put to his carriage and drove to danglarsâ house_of_peers has your husband any spanish bonds he asked of the baroness i think so indeed he has six millionsâ worth â he must sell them at whatever price â why â because don_carlos has fled from bourges and has returned to spain 30203m how do you know m_lucien_debray shrugged his shoulders the idea of asking how i hear the news he said the baroness did not wait for a repetition she ran to her husband who immediately hastened to his agent and ordered him to sell at any price when it was seen that mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars sold the spanish funds fell directly mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars lost five hundred thousand franc but he rid himself of all his spanish shares the same evening the following was read in le messager by telegraph the king don_carlos has escaped the vigilance of his guardians at bourges and has returned to spain by the catalonian frontier barcelona has risen in his favor all that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who had sold his shares and of the luck of the stock jobber who only lost five hundred thousand franc by such a blow those who had kept their shares or bought those of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars looked upon themselves as ruined and passed a very bad night next morning le moniteur contained the following â_it was without any foundation that le messager yesterday announced the flight of don_carlos and the revolt of barcelona the king don_carlos has not left bourges and the peninsula is in the enjoyment of profound peace a telegraphic signal improperly interpreted owing to the fog was the cause of this error
the funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen this reckoning his loss and what he had missed gaining made the difference of a million to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars good said count_of_monte_cristo to m_maximilian_morrel who was at his house_of_peers when the news arrived of the strange reverse of fortune of which mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had been the victim i have just made a discovery for twenty five thousand franc for which i would have paid a hundred thousand â what have you discovered asked m_maximilian_morrel i have just discovered how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches chapter 62 ghosts at first sight the exterior of the house_of_peers at auteuil gave no indications of splendor nothing one would expect from the destined residence of the magnificent count_of_monte_cristo but this simplicity was according to the will of its master who positively ordered nothing to be altered outside the splendor was within indeed almost before the door opened the scene changed monsieur_bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing and in the rapidity with which it was executed it is told that the duc dâ antin removed in a single night a whole avenue of trees that annoyed louis_xviii xiv in three day monsieur_bertuccio planted an entirely bare court with poplars large spreading sycamores to shade the different part of the house_of_peers and in the foreground instead of the usual paving stones half hidden by the grass there extended a lawn but that morning laid down and upon which the water was yet glistening
for the rest the order had been issued by the count he himself had given a plan to monsieur_bertuccio marking the spot where each tree was to be planted and the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the paving stones thus the house_of_peers had become unrecognizable and monsieur_bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it encircled as it was by a framework of trees the overseer would not have objected while he was about it to have made some improvements in the garden but the count had positively forbidden it to be touched monsieur_bertuccio made amends however by loading the antechambers staircases and mantle pieces with flowers what above all manifested the shrewdness of the steward and the profound science of the master the one in carrying out the idea of the other was that this house_of_peers which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time had in a single day acquired the aspect of life was scented with its masterâ favorite perfumes and had the very light regulated according to his wish when the count arrived he had under his touch his books and arm his eye rested upon his favorite pictures his dogs whose caresses he loved welcomed him in the antechamber the birds whose songs delighted him cheered him with their music and the house_of_peers awakened from its long sleep like the sleeping beauty in the wood lived sang and bloomed like the house we have long cherished and in which when we are forced to leave them we leave a part of our souls
the servant passed gayly along the fine courtyard some belonging to the kitchens gliding down the stairs restored but the previous day as if they had always inhabited the house_of_peers others filling the coach house where the equipages encased and numbered appeared to have been installed for the last fifty year and in the stables the horse replied with neighs to the grooms who spoke to them with much more respect than many servant pay their masters the library was divided into two part on either side of the wall and contained upwards of two thousand volumes one division was entirely devoted to novels and even the volume which had been published but the day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and gold binding on the other side of the house_of_peers to match with the library was the conservatory ornamented with rare flowers that bloomed in china jars and in the midst of the greenhouse marvellous alike to sight and smell was a billiard table which looked as if it had been abandoned during the past hour by players who had left the balls on the cloth one chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent monsieur_bertuccio before this room to which you could ascend by the grand and go out by the back staircase the servant passed with curiosity and monsieur_bertuccio with terror at five oâ clock precisely the count arrived before the house_of_peers at auteuil followed by ali_pasha_of_yanina monsieur_bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with impatience mingled with uneasiness he hoped for some compliments while at the same time he feared to have frowns
monte cristo descended into the courtyard walked all over the house_of_peers without giving any sign of approbation or pleasure until he entered his bedroom situated on the opposite side to the closed room then he approached a little piece of furniture made of rosewood which he had noticed at a previous visit that can only be to hold gloves he said will your excellency deign to open it said the delighted monsieur_bertuccio and you will find gloves in it elsewhere the count found everything he requiredâ smelling bottles cigars knick knacks 30207 â good he said and monsieur_bertuccio left enraptured so great so powerful and real was the influence exercised by this man over all who surrounded him at precisely six oâ clock the clatter of horsesâ hoofs was heard at the entrance door it was our captain of spahis who had arrived on mã dã ah i am sure i am the first cried m_maximilian_morrel i did it on purpose to have you a minute to myself before everyone came mademoiselle_julie and m_emmanuel have a thousand thing to tell you ah really this is magnificent but tell me count will your people take care of my horse â do not alarm yourself my dear maximilianâ they understand â i mean because he wants petting if you had seen at what a pace he cameâ like the wind â i should think so a horse that cost 000 franc said count_of_monte_cristo in the tone which a father would use towards a son do you regret them asked m_maximilian_morrel with his open laugh i certainly not replied the count
â no i should only regret if the horse had not proved good â_it is so good that i have distanced de baron_de_chã_teau_renaud one of the best riders in france and m_lucien_debray who both mount the ministerâ arabians and close on their heels are the horse of madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who always go at six leagues an hour â then they follow you asked count_of_monte_cristo see they are here and at the same minute a carriage with smoking horse accompanied by two mounted gentlemen arrived at the gate which opened before them the carriage drove round and stopped at the step followed by the horsemen the instant m_lucien_debray had touched the ground he was at the carriage door he offered his hand to the baroness who descending took it with a peculiarity of manner imperceptible to everyone but count_of_monte_cristo but nothing escaped the countâ notice and he observed a little note passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice from the hand of madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars to that of the ministerâ secretary after his wife the banker descended as pale as though he had issued from his tomb instead of his carriage madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by count_of_monte_cristo around the courtyard over the peristyle and across the front of the house_of_peers then repressing a slight emotion which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color she ascended the step saying to m_maximilian_morrel sir if you were a friend of mine i should ask you if you would sell your horse m_maximilian_morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace and then turned round to count_of_monte_cristo as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment the count understood him ah madame
he said why did you not make that request of me â with you sir replied the baroness one can wish for nothing one is so sure to obtain it if it were so with morrelâ â unfortunately replied the count i am witness that m_maximilian_morrel cannot give up his horse his honor being engaged in keeping it â how so â he laid a wager he would tame mã dã ah in the space of six month you understand now that if he were to get rid of the animal before the time named he would not only lose his bet but people would say he was afraid and a brave captain of spahis cannot risk this even to gratify a pretty woman which is in my opinion one of the most sacred obligations in the world â you see my position madame said m_maximilian_morrel bestowing a grateful smile on count_of_monte_cristo â_it seems to me said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars in his coarse tone ill concealed by a forced smile that you have already got horse enough madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed but to the surprise of the young people she pretended not to hear it and said nothing count_of_monte_cristo smiled at her unusual humility and showed her two immense porcelain jars over which wound marine plants of a size and delicacy that nature alone could produce the baroness was astonished why said she you could plant one of the chestnut trees in the tuileries inside how can such enormous jars have been manufactured â ah madame replied count_of_monte_cristo you must not ask of us the manufacturers of fine porcelain such a question
it is the work of another age constructed by the genii of earth and water â how so at what period can that have been â i do not know i have only heard that an emperor of china had an oven built expressly and that in this oven twelve jars like this were successively baked two broke from the heat of the fire the other ten were sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the sea the sea knowing what was required of her threw over them her weeds encircled them with coral and encrusted them with shells the whole was cemented by two hundred year beneath these almost impervious depths for a revolution carried away the emperor who wished to make the trial and only left the documents proving the manufacture of the jars and their descent into the sea at the end of two hundred year the documents were found and they thought of bringing up the jars divers descended in machines made expressly on the discovery into the bay where they were thrown but of ten three only remained the rest having been broken by the waves i am fond of these jars upon which perhaps misshapen frightful monsters have fixed their cold dull eye and in which myriads of small fish have slept seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies meanwhile mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who had cared little for curiosities was mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orange tree one after another when he had finished with the orange tree he began at the cactus but this not being so easily plucked as the orange tree pricked him dreadfully he shuddered and rubbed his eye as though awaking from a dream
â sir said count_of_monte_cristo to him i do not recommend my pictures to you who possess such splendid paintings but nevertheless here are two by hobbema a paul potter a mieris two by gerard douw a raphael a van dyck a zurbaran and two or three by murillo worth looking at â stay said m_lucien_debray i recognize this hobbema â ah indeed â_yes it was proposed for the museum â which i believe does not contain one said count_of_monte_cristo no and yet they refused to buy it â why said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud you pretend not to know because government was not rich enough â ah pardon me said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud i have heard of these thing every day during the last eight year and i cannot understand them yet â you will by and by said m_lucien_debray i think not replied baron_de_chã_teau_renaud major bartolomeo_cavalcanti m_andrea_cavalcanti and count m_andrea_cavalcanti announced monsieur_baptistin a black satin stock fresh from the makerâ hand gray moustaches a bold eye a majorâ uniform ornamented with three medals and five crossesâ in fact the thorough bearing of an old soldierâ such was the appearance of major bartolomeo_cavalcanti m_andrea_cavalcanti that tender father with whom we are already acquainted close to him dressed in entirely new clothes advanced smilingly count m_andrea_cavalcanti the dutiful son whom we also know the three young people were talking together on the entrance of the new comers their eye glanced from father to son and then naturally enough rested on the latter whom they began criticising m_andrea_cavalcanti said m_lucien_debray a fine name said m_maximilian_morrel â_yes said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud these italians are well named and badly dressed â you are fastidious baron_de_chã_teau_renaud replied m_lucien_debray those clothes are well cut and quite new â that is just what i find fault with
that gentleman appears to be well dressed for the first time in his life â who are those gentlemen asked mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars of count_of_monte_cristo you heardâ m_andrea_cavalcanti â that tells me their name and nothing else â ah true you do not know the italian nobility the m_andrea_cavalcanti are all descended from princes â have they any fortune â an enormous one â what do they do â try to spend it all they have some business with you i think from what they told me the day before yesterday i indeed invited them here today on your account i will introduce you to them â but they appear to speak french with a very pure accent said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars the son has been educated in a college in the south i believe near marseilles you will find him quite enthusiastic â upon what subject asked madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars the french ladies madame he has made up his mind to take a wife from paris â a fine idea that of his said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars shrugging his shoulders madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars looked at her husband with an expression which at any other time would have indicated a storm but for the second time she controlled herself the baron appears thoughtful today said count_of_monte_cristo to her are they going to put him in the ministry â not yet i think more likely he has been speculating on the bourse and has lost money â and madame m_noirtier_de_villefort cried monsieur_baptistin they entered m_noirtier_de_villefort notwithstanding his self control was visibly affected and when count_of_monte_cristo touched his hand he felt it tremble certainly woman alone know how to dissimulate said count_of_monte_cristo to himself glancing at madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who was smiling on the procureur and embracing his wife
after a short time the count saw monsieur_bertuccio who until then had been occupied on the other side of the house_of_peers glide into an adjoining room he went to him what do you want monsieur_bertuccio said he your excellency has not stated the number of guests â ah true â how many covers â count for yourself â is everyone here your excellency â_yes monsieur_bertuccio glanced through the door which was ajar the count watched him good heavens he exclaimed what is the matter said the count that womanâ that woman â which â the one with a white dress and so many diamondsâ the fair one â madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â i do not know her name but it is she sir it is she â whom do you mean â the woman of the garden she that was enceinte she who was walking while she waited forâ â monsieur_bertuccio stood at the open door with his eye starting and his hair on end waiting for whom monsieur_bertuccio without answering pointed to m_noirtier_de_villefort with something of the gesture macbeth uses to point out banquo â_oh oh he at length muttered do you see â what who â him â him m_noirtier_de_villefort the kingâ attorney certainly i see him â then i did not kill him â really i think you are going mad good monsieur_bertuccio said the count then he is not dead 30213m no you see plainly he is not dead instead of striking between the sixth and seventh left ribs as your countrymen do you must have struck higher or lower and life is very tenacious in these lawyers or rather there is no truth in anything you have told meâ it was a fright of the imagination a dream of your fancy you went to sleep full of thoughts of vengeance they weighed heavily upon your stomach you had the nightmareâ thatâ all
come calm yourself and reckon them upâ and madame m_noirtier_de_villefort two and madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars four de baron_de_chã_teau_renaud m_lucien_debray m_maximilian_morrel seven major bartolomeo_cavalcanti m_andrea_cavalcanti eight â eight repeated monsieur_bertuccio stop you are in a shocking hurry to be offâ you forget one of my guests lean a little to the left stay look at m_andrea_cavalcanti the young man in a black coat looking at murilloâ â madonnaâ now he is turning this time monsieur_bertuccio would have uttered an exclamation had not a look from count_of_monte_cristo silenced him m_benedetto he muttered fatality â half past six oâ clock has just struck monsieur_bertuccio said the count severely i ordered dinner at that hour and i do not like to wait and he returned to his guests while monsieur_bertuccio leaning against the wall succeeded in reaching the dining room five minute afterwards the door of the drawing room were thrown open and monsieur_bertuccio appearing said with a violent effort the dinner waits the count_of_monte_cristo offered his arm to madame m_noirtier_de_villefort m_noirtier_de_villefort he said will you conduct the baroness mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort complied and they passed on to the dining room chapter 63 the dinner it was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering the dining room each one asked what strange influence had brought them to this house_of_peers and yet astonished even uneasy though they were they still felt that they would not like to be absent the recent events the solitary and eccentric position of the count his enormous nay almost incredible fortune should have made man cautious and have altogether prevented ladies visiting a house_of_peers where there was no one of their own sex to receive them and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them to overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum
and all present even including m_andrea_cavalcanti and his son notwithstanding the stiffness of the one and the carelessness of the other were thoughtful on finding themselves assembled at the house_of_peers of this incomprehensible man madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had started when m_noirtier_de_villefort on the countâ invitation offered his arm and m_noirtier_de_villefort felt that his glance was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles when he felt the arm of the baroness press upon his own none of this had escaped the count and even by this mere contact of individuals the scene had already acquired considerable interest for an observer m_noirtier_de_villefort had on the right hand madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars on his left m_maximilian_morrel the count was seated between madame m_noirtier_de_villefort and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars the other seats were filled by m_lucien_debray who was placed between the two m_andrea_cavalcanti and by baron_de_chã_teau_renaud seated between madame m_noirtier_de_villefort and m_maximilian_morrel the repast was magnificent count_of_monte_cristo had endeavored completely to overturn the parisian idea and to feed the curiosity as much as the appetite of his guests it was an oriental feast that he offered to them but of such a kind as the arabian fairies might be supposed to prepare every delicious fruit that the four quarters of the globe could provide was heaped in vases from china and jars from japan
rare birds retaining their most brilliant plumage enormous fish spread upon massive silver dishes together with every wine produced in the archipelago asia minor or the cape sparkling in bottles whose grotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draught all these like one of the displays with which apicius of old gratified his guests passed in review before the eye of the astonished parisians who understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis_xviii upon a dinner for ten person but only on the condition of eating pearls like cleopatra or drinking refined gold like lorenzo deâ medici count_of_monte_cristo noticed the general astonishment and began laughing and joking about it gentlemen he said you will admit that when arrived at a certain degree of fortune the superfluities of life are all that can be desired and the ladies will allow that after having risen to a certain eminence of position the ideal alone can be more exalted now to follow out this reasoning what is the marvellous that which we do not understand what is it that we really desire that which we cannot obtain now to see thing which i cannot understand to procure impossibilities these are the study of my life i gratify my wishes by two meansâ my will and my money i take as much interest in the pursuit of some whim as you do mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars in promoting a new railway line you m_noirtier_de_villefort in condemning a culprit to death you m_lucien_debray in pacifying a kingdom you de baron_de_chã_teau_renaud in pleasing a woman and you m_maximilian_morrel in breaking a horse that no one can ride for example you see these two fish one brought from fifty leagues beyond st petersburg the other five leagues from naples
is it not amusing to see them both on the same table â what are the two fish asked mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m baron_de_chã_teau_renaud who has lived in russia will tell you the name of one and major m_andrea_cavalcanti who is an italian will tell you the name of the other â this one is i think a sterlet said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud and that one if i mistake not a lamprey â just so now mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars ask these gentlemen where they are caught â sterlets said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud are only found in the volga â and said m_andrea_cavalcanti i know that lake fusaro alone supplies lampreys of that size â exactly one comes from the volga and the other from lake fusaro â impossible cried all the guests simultaneously well this is just what amuses me said count_of_monte_cristo i am like neroâ cupitor impossibilium and that is what is amusing you at this moment this fish which seems so exquisite to you is very likely no better than perch or salmon but it seemed impossible to procure it and here it is â but how could you have these fish brought to france â_oh nothing more easy each fish was brought over in a caskâ one filled with river herbs and weeds the other with rushes and lake plants they were placed in a wagon built on purpose and thus the sterlet lived twelve day the lamprey eight and both were alive when my cook seized them killing one with milk and the other with wine you do not believe me mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â i cannot help doubting answered mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with his stupid smile monsieur_baptistin said the count have the other fish brought inâ the sterlet and the lamprey which came in the other casks and which are yet alive mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars opened his bewildered eye the company clapped their hand
four servant carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants and in each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the table but why have two of each sort asked mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars merely because one might have died carelessly answered count_of_monte_cristo you are certainly an extraordinary man said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich â and to have idea added madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â_oh do not give me credit for this madame it was done by the romans who much esteemed them and pliny relates that they sent slaves from ostia to rome who carried on their head fish which he calls the mulus and which from the description must probably be the goldfish it was also considered a luxury to have them alive it being an amusing sight to see them die for when dying they change color three or four time and like the rainbow when it disappears pass through all the prismatic shades after which they were sent to the kitchen their agony formed part of their meritâ if they were not seen alive they were despised when dead â_yes said m_lucien_debray but then ostia is only a few leagues from rome â true said count_of_monte_cristo but what would be the use of living eighteen hundred year after lucullus if we can do no better than he could the two m_andrea_cavalcanti opened their enormous eye but had the good sense not to say anything all this is very extraordinary said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud still what i admire the most i confess is the marvellous promptitude with which your order are executed is it not true that you only bought this house_of_peers five or six day ago â certainly not longer â well i am sure it is quite transformed since last week
if i remember rightly it had another entrance and the courtyard was paved and empty while today we have a splendid lawn bordered by trees which appear to be a hundred year old â why not i am fond of grass and shade said count_of_monte_cristo â_yes said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort the door was towards the road before and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house_of_peers from the road i remember â_yes madame said count_of_monte_cristo but i preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the bois de boulogne over my gate â in four day said m_maximilian_morrel â_it is extraordinary â indeed said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud â_it seems quite miraculous to make a new house_of_peers out of an old one for it was very old and dull too i recollect coming for my mother to look at it when de madame_de_saint_mã_ran advertised it for sale two or three year ago â de madame_de_saint_mã_ran said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort then this house_of_peers belonged to de madame_de_saint_mã_ran before you bought it â_it appears so replied count_of_monte_cristo is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it â quite so my steward transacts all this business for me â_it is certainly ten year since the house_of_peers had been occupied said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud and it was quite melancholy to look at it with the blinds closed the door locked and the weeds in the court really if the house_of_peers had not belonged to the father in law of the procureur one might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had been committed m_noirtier_de_villefort who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glass of rare wine which were placed before him here took one and drank it off
monte cristo allowed a short time to elapse and then said â_it is singular baron but the same idea came across me the first time i came here it looked so gloomy i should never have bought it if my steward had not taken the matter into his own hand perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the notary â_it is probable stammered out m_noirtier_de_villefort trying to smile but i can assure you that i had nothing to do with any such proceeding this house_of_peers is part of valentineâ marriage portion and de madame_de_saint_mã_ran wished to sell it for if it had remained another year or two uninhabited it would have fallen to ruin â_it was morrelâ turn to become pale there was above all one room continued count_of_monte_cristo very plain in appearance hung with red damask which i know not why appeared to me quite dramatic â why so said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars why dramatic â can we account for instinct said count_of_monte_cristo are there not some place where we seem to breathe sadness why we cannot tell it is a chain of recollectionsâ an idea which carries you back to other time to other placesâ which very likely have no connection with the present time and place and there is something in this room which reminds me forcibly of the chamber of the marquise de ganges10 or desdemona stay since we have finished dinner i will show it to you and then we will take coffee in the garden after dinner the play count_of_monte_cristo looked inquiringly at his guests madame m_noirtier_de_villefort rose count_of_monte_cristo did the same and the rest followed their example m_noirtier_de_villefort and madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars remained for a moment as if rooted to their seats they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances
â did you hear said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars we must go replied m_noirtier_de_villefort offering his arm the others attracted by curiosity were already scattered in different part of the house_of_peers for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room and that at the same time they would obtain a view of the rest of the building of which count_of_monte_cristo had created a palace each one went out by the open door count_of_monte_cristo waited for the two who remained then when they had passed he brought up the rear and on his face was a smile which if they could have understood it would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to enter they began by walking through the apartments many of which were fitted up in the eastern style with cushions and divans instead of bed and pipes instead of furniture the drawing room were decorated with the rarest pictures by the old masters the boudoirs hung with draperies from china of fanciful colors fantastic design and wonderful texture at length they arrived at the famous room there was nothing particular about it excepting that although daylight had disappeared it was not lighted and everything in it was old fashioned while the rest of the room had been redecorated these two causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect â_oh cried madame m_noirtier_de_villefort â_it is really frightful madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars tried to utter a few word but was not heard many observations were made the import of which was a unanimous opinion that there was something sinister about the room 30221m is it not so asked count_of_monte_cristo look at that large clumsy bed hung with such gloomy blood colored drapery
and those two crayon portraits that have faded from the dampness do they not seem to say with their pale lip and staring eye we have seenâ m_noirtier_de_villefort became livid madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars fell into a long seat placed near the chimney â_oh said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort smiling are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars rose suddenly and then said count_of_monte_cristo this is not all â what is there more said m_lucien_debray who had not failed to notice the agitation of madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars ah what else is there said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars for at present i cannot say that i have seen anything extraordinary what do you say m_andrea_cavalcanti â ah said he we have at pisa ugolinoâ tower at ferrara tassoâ prison at rimini the room of francesca and paolo â_yes but you have not this little staircase said count_of_monte_cristo opening a door concealed by the drapery look at it and tell me what you think of it â what a wicked looking crooked staircase said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud with a smile i do not know whether the wine of chios produces melancholy but certainly everything appears to me black in this house_of_peers said m_lucien_debray ever since valentineâ dowry had been mentioned m_maximilian_morrel had been silent and sad can you imagine said count_of_monte_cristo some othello or abbã de ganges one stormy dark night descending these stairs step by step carrying a load which he wishes to hide from the sight of man if not from god madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars half fainted on the arm of m_noirtier_de_villefort who was obliged to support himself against the wall ah madame cried m_lucien_debray what is the matter with you
how pale you look â_it is very evident what is the matter with her said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort m de count_of_monte_cristo is relating horrible stories to us doubtless intending to frighten us to death â_yes said m_noirtier_de_villefort really count you frighten the ladies â what is the matter asked m_lucien_debray in a whisper of madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars nothing she replied with a violent effort i want air that is all â will you come into the garden said m_lucien_debray advancing towards the back staircase no no she answered i would rather remain here â are you really frightened madame said count_of_monte_cristo â_oh no sir said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars but you suppose scenes in a manner which gives them the appearance of reality 30223m ah yes said count_of_monte_cristo smiling â_it is all a matter of imagination why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest mother and this bed with red hangings a bed visited by the goddess lucina and that mysterious staircase the passage through which not to disturb their sleep the doctor and nurse pass or even the father carrying the sleeping child here madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars instead of being calmed by the soft picture uttered a groan and fainted madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is ill said m_noirtier_de_villefort â_it would be better to take her to her carriage â_oh mon dieu said count_of_monte_cristo and i have forgotten my smelling bottle â i have mine said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort and she passed over to count_of_monte_cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good properties the count had tested on edward ah said count_of_monte_cristo taking it from her hand â_yes she said at your advice i have made the trial â and have you succeeded â i think so
madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was carried into the adjoining room count_of_monte_cristo dropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lip she returned to consciousness ah she cried what a frightful dream m_noirtier_de_villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream they looked for mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars but as he was not especially interested in poetical idea he had gone into the garden and was talking with major m_andrea_cavalcanti on the projected railway from leghorn to florence count_of_monte_cristo seemed in despair he took the arm of madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and conducted her into the garden where they found mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars taking coffee between the m_andrea_cavalcanti really madame he said did i alarm you much â_oh no sir she answered but you know thing impress us differently according to the mood of our mind m_noirtier_de_villefort forced a laugh and then you know he said an idea a supposition is sufficient â well said count_of_monte_cristo you may believe me if you like but it is my opinion that a crime has been committed in this house_of_peers â take care said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort the kingâ attorney is here â ah replied count_of_monte_cristo since that is the case i will take advantage of his presence to make my declaration â your declaration said m_noirtier_de_villefort â_yes before witnesses â_oh this is very interesting said m_lucien_debray if there really has been a crime we will investigate it â there has been a crime said count_of_monte_cristo come this way gentlemen come m_noirtier_de_villefort for a declaration to be available should be made before the competent authorities he then took villefortâ arm and at the same time holding that of madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars under his own he dragged the procureur to the plantain tree where the shade was thickest all the other guests followed
â stay said count_of_monte_cristo here in this very spotâ and he stamped upon the ground i had the earth dug up and fresh mould put in to refresh these old trees well my man digging found a box or rather the iron work of a box in the midst of which was the skeleton of a newly born infant 30225m count_of_monte_cristo felt the arm of madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars stiffen while that of m_noirtier_de_villefort trembled a newly born infant repeated m_lucien_debray this affair becomes serious â well said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud i was not wrong just now then when i said that house had souls and face like man and that their exteriors carried the impress of their characters this house_of_peers was gloomy because it was remorseful it was remorseful because it concealed a crime â who said it was a crime asked m_noirtier_de_villefort with a last effort how is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden cried count_of_monte_cristo and pray what do you call such an action â but who said it was buried alive â why bury it there if it were dead this garden has never been a cemetery â what is done to infanticides in this country asked major m_andrea_cavalcanti innocently â_oh their head are soon cut off said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars ah indeed said m_andrea_cavalcanti i think so am i not right m_noirtier_de_villefort asked count_of_monte_cristo â_yes count replied m_noirtier_de_villefort in a voice now scarcely human count_of_monte_cristo seeing that the two person for whom he had prepared this scene could scarcely endure it and not wishing to carry it too far said come gentlemen some coffee we seem to have forgotten it and he conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn
â indeed count said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i am ashamed to own it but all your frightful stories have so upset me that i must beg you to let me sit down and she fell into a chair count_of_monte_cristo bowed and went to madame m_noirtier_de_villefort i think madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars again requires your bottle he said but before madame m_noirtier_de_villefort could reach her friend the procureur had found time to whisper to madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i must speak to you â when â tomorrow â where â in my office or in the court if you like that is the surest place â i will be there at this moment madame m_noirtier_de_villefort approached thanks my dear friend said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars trying to smile â_it is over now and i am much better chapter 64 the beggar the evening passed on madame m_noirtier_de_villefort expressed a desire to return to paris which madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had not dared to do notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced on his wifeâ request m_noirtier_de_villefort was the first to give the signal of departure he offered a seat in his landau to madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars that she might be under the care of his wife as for mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars absorbed in an interesting conversation with m_andrea_cavalcanti he paid no attention to anything that was passing while count_of_monte_cristo had begged the smelling bottle of madame m_noirtier_de_villefort he had noticed the approach of m_noirtier_de_villefort to madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and he soon guessed all that had passed between them though the word had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars without opposing their arrangements he allowed m_maximilian_morrel baron_de_chã_teau_renaud and m_lucien_debray to leave on horseback and the ladies in de villefortâ carriage
danglars more and more delighted with major m_andrea_cavalcanti had offered him a seat in his carriage m_andrea_cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door the groom in every respect a caricature of the english fashion was standing on tiptoe to hold a large iron gray horse m_andrea_cavalcanti had spoken very little during dinner he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people amongst whom with dilating eye he saw the kingâ attorney then he had been seized upon by mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who with a rapid glance at the stiff necked old major and his modest son and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to paris to finish the worldly education of his heir he contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the majorâ little finger for the major like a prudent man in case of any accident happening to his bank notes had immediately converted them into an available asset then after dinner on the pretext of business he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living and the father and son previously informed that it was through mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars the one was to receive his 48 000 franc and the other 50 000 livres annually were so full of affability that they would have shaken hand even with the bankerâ servant so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon one thing above all the rest heightened the respect nay almost the veneration of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars for m_andrea_cavalcanti the latter faithful to the principle of horace nil admirari had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught
then he had eaten some without saying a word more mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the m_andrea_cavalcanti who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland and lobsters sent from england by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro and the sterlet from the volga thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard m_andrea_cavalcanti pronounce these word tomorrow sir i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business â and i sir said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars shall be most happy to receive you upon which he offered to take m_andrea_cavalcanti in his carriage to the hã tel des princes if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son to this m_andrea_cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived independently of him that he had his own horse and carriage and that not having come together it would not be difficult for them to leave separately the major seated himself therefore by the side of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who was more and more charmed with the idea of order and economy which ruled this man and yet who being able to allow his son 60 000 franc a year might be supposed to possess a fortune of 500 000 or 600 000 livres as for m_andrea_cavalcanti he began by way of showing off to scold his groom who instead of bringing the tilbury to the step of the house_of_peers had taken it to the outer door thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty step to reach it
the groom heard him with humility took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand and with the right held out the reins to m_andrea_cavalcanti who taking them from him rested his polished boot lightly on the step at that moment a hand touched his shoulder the young man turned round thinking that mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars or count_of_monte_cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him and had returned just as they were starting but instead of either of these he saw nothing but a strange face sunburnt and encircled by a beard with eye brilliant as carbuncles and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth pointed and sharp as the wolfâ or jackalâ a red handkerchief encircled his gray head torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs which seemed as though like those of a skeleton they would rattle as he walked and the hand with which he leaned upon the young manâ shoulder and which was the first thing m_andrea_cavalcanti saw seemed of gigantic size 30229m did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his interrogator we cannot say but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly what do you want of me he asked pardon me my friend if i disturb you said the man with the red handkerchief but i want to speak to you â you have no right to beg at night said the groom endeavoring to rid his master of the troublesome intruder
â i am not begging my fine fellow said the unknown to the servant with so ironical an expression of the eye and so frightful a smile that he withdrew i only wish to say two or three word to your master who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago â come said m_andrea_cavalcanti with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agitation what do you want speak quickly friend the man said in a low voice i wishâ i wish you to spare me the walk back to paris i am very tired and as i have not eaten so good a dinner as you i can scarcely stand the young man shuddered at this strange familiarity tell me he saidâ tell me what you want â well then i want you to take me up in your fine carriage and carry me back m_andrea_cavalcanti turned pale but said nothing â_yes said the man thrusting his hand into his pockets and looking impudently at the youth i have taken the whim into my head do you understand master m_benedetto at this name no doubt the young man reflected a little for he went towards his groom saying this man is right i did indeed charge him with a commission the result of which he must tell me walk to the barrier there take a cab that you may not be too late the surprised groom retired let me at least reach a shady spot said m_andrea_cavalcanti â_oh as for that iâ ll take you to a splendid place said the man with the handkerchief and taking the horseâ bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that m_andrea_cavalcanti conferred upon him
â donâ think i want the glory of riding in your fine carriage said he â_oh no itâ only because i am tired and also because i have a little business to talk over with you â come step in said the young man it was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury m_andrea_cavalcanti drove past the last house_of_peers in the village without saying a word to his companion who smiled complacently as though well pleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle once out of auteuil m_andrea_cavalcanti looked around in order to assure himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and then stopping the horse and crossing his arm before the man he asked now tell me why you come to disturb my tranquillity â let me ask you why you deceived me â how have i deceived you â how do you ask when we parted at the pont du var you told me you were going to travel through piedmont and tuscany but instead of that you come to paris â how does that annoy you â_it does not on the contrary i think it will answer my purpose â so said m_andrea_cavalcanti you are speculating upon me â what fine word he uses â i warn you master m_caderousse that you are mistaken â well well donâ be angry my boy you know well enough what it is to be unfortunate and misfortunes make us jealous i thought you were earning a living in tuscany or piedmont by acting as facchino or cicerone and i pitied you sincerely as i would a child of my own
you know i always did call you my child â come come what then â patienceâ patience â i am patient but go on â all at once i see you pass through the barrier with a groom a tilbury and fine new clothes you must have discovered a mine or else become a stockbroker â so that as you confess you are jealous â no i am pleasedâ so pleased that i wished to congratulate you but as i am not quite properly dressed i chose my opportunity that i might not compromise you â_yes and a fine opportunity you have chosen exclaimed m_andrea_cavalcanti you speak to me before my servant â how can i help that my boy i speak to you when i can catch you you have a quick horse a light tilbury you are naturally as slippery as an eel if i had missed you tonight i might not have had another chance â you see i do not conceal myself â you are lucky i wish i could say as much for i do conceal myself and then i was afraid you would not recognize me but you did added m_caderousse with his unpleasant smile â_it was very polite of you â come said m_andrea_cavalcanti what do you want â you do not speak affectionately to me m_benedetto my old friend that is not rightâ take care or i may become troublesome this menace smothered the young manâ passion he urged the horse again into a trot you should not speak so to an old friend like me m_caderousse as you said just now you are a native of marseilles i amâ â do you know then now what you are â no but i was brought up in corsica you are old and obstinate i am young and wilful
between people like us threats are out of place everything should be amicably arranged is it my fault if fortune which has frowned on you has been kind to me â fortune has been kind to you then your tilbury your groom your clothes are not then hired good so much the better said m_caderousse his eye sparkling with avarice â_oh you knew that well enough before speaking to me said m_andrea_cavalcanti becoming more and more excited if i had been wearing a handkerchief like yours on my head rags on my back and worn out shoes on my foot you would not have known me â you wrong me my boy now i have found you nothing prevents my being as well dressed as anyone knowing as i do the goodness of your heart if you have two coats you will give me one of them i used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry â true said m_andrea_cavalcanti what an appetite you used to have is it as good now â_oh yes replied m_andrea_cavalcanti laughing how did you come to be dining with that prince whose house_of_peers you have just left â he is not a prince simply a count â a count and a rich one too eh â_yes but you had better not have anything to say to him for he is not a very good tempered gentleman â_oh be easy i have no design upon your count and you shall have him all to yourself
but said m_caderousse again smiling with the disagreeable expression he had before assumed you must pay for itâ you understand â well what do you want â i think that with a hundred franc a monthâ â well â i could liveâ â upon a hundred franc â comeâ you understand me but that withâ â with â with a hundred and fifty franc i should be quite happy â here are two hundred said m_andrea_cavalcanti and he placed ten gold louis_xviii in the hand of m_caderousse 30233m good said m_caderousse apply to the steward on the first day of every month and you will receive the same sum â there now again you degrade me â how so â by making me apply to the servant when i want to transact business with you alone â well be it so then take it from me then and so long at least as i receive my income you shall be paid yours â come come i always said you were a fine fellow and it is a blessing when good fortune happens to such as you but tell me all about it â why do you wish to know asked m_andrea_cavalcanti what do you again defy me â no the fact is i have found my father â what a real father â_yes so long as he pays meâ â youâ ll honor and believe himâ thatâ right what is his name â major m_andrea_cavalcanti â is he pleased with you â so far i have appeared to answer his purpose â and who found this father for you â the count_of_monte_cristo â the man whose house_of_peers you have just left â_yes â i wish you would try and find me a situation with him as grandfather since he holds the money chest â well i will mention you to him
meanwhile what are you going to do â i â_yes you â_it is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me â since you interest yourself in my affairs i think it is now my turn to ask you some questions â ah true well i shall rent a room in some respectable house_of_peers wear a decent coat shave every day and go and read the paper in a cafã then in the evening i shall go to the theatre i shall look like some retired baker that is what i want â come if you will only put this scheme into execution and be steady nothing could be better â do you think so bossuet and youâ what will you become a peer of france â ah said m_andrea_cavalcanti who knows â major m_andrea_cavalcanti is already one perhaps but then hereditary rank is abolished â no politics m_caderousse and now that you have all you want and that we understand each other jump down from the tilbury and disappear â not at all my good friend â how not at all â why just think for a moment with this red handkerchief on my head with scarcely any shoes no paper and ten gold napoleons in my pocket without reckoning what was there beforeâ making in all about two hundred franc why i should certainly be arrested at the barriers then to justify myself i should say that you gave me the money this would cause inquiries it would be found that i left toulon without giving due notice and i should then be escorted back to the shores of the mediterranean then i should become simply no 106 and good bye to my dream of resembling the retired baker no no my boy i prefer remaining honorably in the capital m_andrea_cavalcanti scowled
certainly as he had himself owned the reputed son of major m_andrea_cavalcanti was a wilful fellow he drew up for a minute threw a rapid glance around him and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket where it began playing with a pistol but meanwhile m_caderousse who had never taken his eye off his companion passed his hand behind his back and opened a long spanish knife which he always carried with him to be ready in case of need the two friend as we see were worthy of and understood one another andreaâ hand left his pocket inoffensively and was carried up to the red moustache which it played with for some time good m_caderousse he said how happy you will be â i will do my best said the innkeeper of the pont du gard shutting up his knife well then we will go into paris but how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion it seems to me that you are in more danger riding than on foot â wait said m_caderousse we shall see he then took the greatcoat with the large collar which the groom had left behind in the tilbury and put it on his back then he took off cavalcantiâ hat which he placed upon his own head and finally he assumed the careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself but tell me said m_andrea_cavalcanti am i to remain bareheaded â pooh said m_caderousse â_it is so windy that your hat can easily appear to have blown off â come come enough of this said m_andrea_cavalcanti what are you waiting for said m_caderousse i hope i am not the cause â hush said m_andrea_cavalcanti they passed the barrier without accident at the first cross street m_andrea_cavalcanti stopped his horse and m_caderousse leaped out
â well said m_andrea_cavalcanti â my servantâ coat and my hat â ah said m_caderousse you would not like me to risk taking cold â but what am i to do â you oh you are young while i am beginning to get old au revoir m_benedetto and running into a court he disappeared alas said m_andrea_cavalcanti sighing one cannot be completely happy in this world chapter 65 a conjugal scene at the place louis_xviii xv the three young people separatedâ that is to say m_maximilian_morrel went to the boulevards baron_de_chã_teau_renaud to the pont de la rã volution and m_lucien_debray to the quai most probably m_maximilian_morrel and baron_de_chã_teau_renaud returned to their domestic hearths as they say in the gallery of the chamber in well turned speeches and in the theatre of the rue richelieu in well written pieces but it was not the case with m_lucien_debray when he reached the wicket of the louvre he turned to the left galloped across the carrousel passed through the rue saint roch and issuing from the rue de la michodiã re he arrived at danglarsâ door just at the same time that villefortâ landau after having deposited him and his wife at the faubourg saint honorã stopped to leave the baroness at her own house_of_peers m_lucien_debray with the air of a man familiar with the house_of_peers entered first into the court threw his bridle into the hand of a footman and returned to the door to receive madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars to whom he offered his arm to conduct her to her apartments the gate once closed and m_lucien_debray and the baroness alone in the court he asked what was the matter with you hermine
and why were you so affected at that story or rather fable which the count related â because i have been in such shocking spirits all the evening my friend said the baroness no hermine replied m_lucien_debray you cannot make me believe that on the contrary you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the countâ m mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was disagreeable certainly but i know how much you care for his ill humor someone has vexed you i will allow no one to annoy you â you are deceived m_lucien_debray i assure you replied madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and what i have told you is really the case added to the ill humor you remarked but which i did not think it worth while to allude to â_it was evident that madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which woman frequently cannot account for even to themselves or that as m_lucien_debray had guessed she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone being a man who knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the inherent penalties of womanhood he did not then press his inquiries but waited for a more appropriate opportunity when he should again interrogate her or receive an avowal proprio motu at the door of her apartment the baroness met mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars cornã lie her confidential maid what is my daughter doing asked madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars she practiced all the evening and then went to bed replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars cornã lie yet i think i hear her piano â_it is mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly dâ armilly who is playing while mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is in bed â well said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars come and undress me they entered the bedroom m_lucien_debray stretched himself upon a large couch and madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars passed into her dressing room with mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars cornã lie my
dear m_lucien_debray said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars through the door you are always complaining that mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars will not address a word to you â madame said m_lucien_debray playing with a little dog who recognizing him as a friend of the house_of_peers expected to be caressed i am not the only one who makes similar complaints i think i heard viscount_albert_de_morcerf say that he could not extract a word from his betrothed â true said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars yet i think this will all pass off and that you will one day see her enter your study â my study â at least that of the minister â why so â to ask for an engagement at the opera really i never saw such an infatuation for music it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of fashion m_lucien_debray smiled well said he let her come with your consent and that of the baron and we will try and give her an engagement though we are very poor to pay such talent as hers â go cornã lie said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i do not require you any longer cornã lie obeyed and the next minute madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars left her room in a charming loose dress and came and sat down close to m_lucien_debray then she began thoughtfully to caress the little spaniel m_lucien_debray looked at her for a moment in silence come hermine he said after a short time answer candidly something vexes youâ is it not so 30239m nothing answered the baroness and yet as she could scarcely breathe she rose and went towards a looking glass i am frightful tonight she said m_lucien_debray rose smiling and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter point when the door opened suddenly mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars appeared m_lucien_debray reseated himself
at the noise of the door madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars turned round and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to conceal good evening madame said the banker good evening m_lucien_debray probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp word he had uttered during the day assuming a dignified air she turned round to m_lucien_debray without answering her husband read me something m_lucien_debray she said m_lucien_debray who was slightly disturbed at this visit recovered himself when he saw the calmness of the baroness and took up a book marked by a mother of pearl knife inlaid with gold excuse me said the banker but you will tire yourself baroness by such late hour and m_lucien_debray life some distance from here m_lucien_debray was petrified not only to hear mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars speak so calmly and politely but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to do the baroness was also surprised and showed her astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper where he was looking to see the closing stock quotations the result was that the proud look entirely failed of its purpose m_lucien_debray said the baroness i assure you i have no desire to sleep and that i have a thousand thing to tell you this evening which you must listen to even though you slept while hearing me â i am at your service madame replied m_lucien_debray coldly my
dear m_lucien_debray said the banker do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars for you can hear them as well tomorrow but i claim tonight and will devote it if you will allow me to talk over some serious matters with my wife this time the blow was so well aimed and hit so directly that m_lucien_debray and the baroness were staggered and they interrogated each other with their eye as if to seek help against this aggression but the irresistible will of the master of the house_of_peers prevailed and the husband was victorious do not think i wish to turn you out my dear m_lucien_debray continued mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â_oh no not at all an unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me it is so rarely i make such a request i am sure you cannot grudge it to me m_lucien_debray muttered something bowed and went out knocking himself against the edge of the door like nathan in athalie â_it is extraordinary he said when the door was closed behind him how easily these husbands whom we ridicule gain an advantage over us 30241m m_lucien_debray having left mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars took his place on the sofa closed the open book and placing himself in a dreadfully dictatorial attitude he began playing with the dog but the animal not liking him as well as m_lucien_debray and attempting to bite him mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars seized him by the skin of his neck and threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room the animal uttered a cry during the transit but arrived at its destination it crouched behind the cushions and stupefied at such unusual treatment remained silent and motionless
â do you know sir asked the baroness that you are improving generally you are only rude but tonight you are brutal â_it is because i am in a worse humor than usual replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars hermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain these glances frequently exasperated the pride of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars but this evening he took no notice of them and what have i to do with your ill humor said the baroness irritated at the impassibility of her husband do these thing concern me keep your ill humor at home in your money boxes or since you have clerks whom you pay vent it upon them â not so replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars your advice is wrong so i shall not follow it my money boxes are my pactolus as i think demoustier says and i will not retard its course or disturb its calm my clerks are honest man who earn my fortune whom i pay much below their deserts if i may value them according to what they bring in therefore i shall not get into a passion with them those with whom i will be in a passion are those who eat my dinners mount my horse and exhaust my fortune â and pray who are the person who exhaust your fortune explain yourself more clearly i beg sir â_oh make yourself easy i am not speaking riddles and you will soon know what i mean the people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out 700 000 franc in the course of an hour â i do not understand you sir said the baroness trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face
â you understand me perfectly on the contrary said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars but if you will persist i will tell you that i have just lost 700 000 franc upon the spanish loan â and pray asked the baroness am i responsible for this loss â why not â is it my fault you have lost 700 000 franc â certainly it is not mine â once for all sir replied the baroness sharply i tell you i will not hear cash named it is a style of language i never heard in the house_of_peers of my parents or in that of my first husband â_oh i can well believe that for neither of them was worth a penny â the better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the bank which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night that noise of jingling crowns which are constantly being counted and re counted is odious to me i only know one thing i dislike more which is the sound of your voice â really said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars well this surprises me for i thought you took the liveliest interest in all my affairs 30243m i what could put such an idea into your head â yourself â ah what next â most assuredly â i should like to know upon what occasion â_oh mon dieu that is very easily done last february you were the first who told me of the haitian funds you had dreamed that a ship had entered the harbor at le havre that this ship brought news that a payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made i know how clear sighted your dreams are i therefore purchased immediately as many shares as i could of the haitian debt and i gained 400 000 franc by it of which 100 000 have been honestly paid to you
you spent it as you pleased that was your business in march there was a question about a grant to a railway three companies presented themselves each offering equal securities you told me that your instinct and although you pretend to know nothing about speculations i think on the contrary that your comprehension is very clear upon certain affairs well you told me that your instinct led you to believe the grant would be given to the company called the southern i bought two thirds of the shares of that company as you had foreseen the shares trebled in value and i picked up a million from which 250 000 franc were paid to you for pin money how have you spent this 250 000 franc â_it is no business of mine â when are you coming to the point cried the baroness shivering with anger and impatience patience madame i am coming to it â thatâ fortunate â in april you went to dine at the ministerâ you heard a private conversation respecting spanish affairsâ on the expulsion of don_carlos i bought some spanish shares the expulsion took place and i pocketed 600 000 franc the day charles repassed the bidassoa of these 600 000 franc you took 50 000 crowns they were yours you disposed of them according to your fancy and i asked no questions but it is not the less true that you have this year received 500 000 livres â well sir and what then â ah yes it was just after this that you spoiled everything â really your manner of speakingâ â â_it expresses my meaning and that is all i want well three day after that you talked politics with m_lucien_debray and you fancied from his word that don_carlos had returned to spain
well i sold my shares the news got out and i no longer soldâ i gave them away next day i find the news was false and by this false report i have lost 700 000 franc â well â well since i gave you a fourth of my gains i think you owe me a fourth of my losses the fourth of 700 000 franc is 175 000 franc â what you say is absurd and i cannot see why debrayâ name is mixed up in this affair â because if you do not possess the 175 000 franc i reclaim you must have lent them to your friend and m_lucien_debray is one of your friend 30245m for shame exclaimed the baroness â_oh let us have no gestures no screams no modern drama or you will oblige me to tell you that i see m_lucien_debray leave here pocketing the whole of the 500 000 livres you have handed over to him this year while he smile to himself saying that he has found what the most skilful players have never discoveredâ that is a roulette where he wins without playing and is no loser when he loses the baroness became enraged wretch she cried will you dare to tell me you did not know what you now reproach me with â i do not say that i did know it and i do not say that i did not know it i merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four year that we have ceased to be husband and wife and see whether it has not always been consistent
some time after our rupture you wished to study music under the celebrated baritone who made such a successful appearance at the thã tre italien at the same time i felt inclined to learn dancing of the danseuse who acquired such a reputation in london this cost me on your account and mine 100 000 franc i said nothing for we must have peace in the house_of_peers and 100 000 franc for a lady and gentleman to be properly instructed in music and dancing are not too much well you soon become tired of singing and you take a fancy to study diplomacy with the ministerâ secretary you understand it signifies nothing to me so long as you pay for your lessons out of your own cash box but today i find you are drawing on mine and that your apprenticeship may cost me 700 000 franc per month stop there madame for this cannot last either the diplomatist must give his lessons gratis and i will tolerate him or he must never set his foot again in my house_of_peers do you understand madame â_oh this is too much cried hermine choking you are worse than despicable â but continued mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i find you did not even pause thereâ â insults â you are right let us leave these facts alone and reason coolly i have never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good treat me in the same way you say you have nothing to do with my cash box be it so do as you like with your own but do not fill or empty mine
besides how do i know that this was not a political trick that the minister enraged at seeing me in the opposition and jealous of the popular sympathy i excite has not concerted with m_lucien_debray to ruin me â a probable thing â why not who ever heard of such an occurrence as this a false telegraphic despatchâ it is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two telegrams it was done on purpose for meâ i am sure of it â sir said the baroness humbly are you not aware that the man employed there was dismissed that they talked of going to law with him that order were issued to arrest him and that this order would have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight which proves that he was either mad or guilty it was a mistake â_yes which made fools laugh which caused the minister to have a sleepless night which has caused the ministerâ secretaries to blacken several sheets of paper but which has cost me 700 000 franc â but sir said hermine suddenly if all this is as you say caused by m_lucien_debray why instead of going direct to him do you come and tell me of it why to accuse the man do you address the woman â do i know m_lucien_debray do i wish to know him do i wish to know that he gives advice do i wish to follow it do i speculate no you do all this not i â still it seems to me that as you profit by itâ â mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars shrugged his shoulders foolish creature he exclaimed woman fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three intrigues without being the talk of paris
but know that if you had even hidden your irregularities from your husband who has but the commencement of the artâ for generally husbands will not seeâ you would then have been but a faint imitation of most of your friend among the woman of the world but it has not been so with me i see and always have seen during the last sixteen year you may perhaps have hidden a thought but not a step not an action not a fault has escaped me while you flattered yourself upon your address and firmly believed you had deceived me what has been the result that thanks to my pretended ignorance there is none of your friend from m_noirtier_de_villefort to m_lucien_debray who has not trembled before me there is not one who has not treated me as the master of the house_of_peers the only title i desire with respect to you there is not one in fact who would have dared to speak of me as i have spoken of them this day i will allow you to make me hateful but i will prevent your rendering me ridiculous and above all i forbid you to ruin me the baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of m_noirtier_de_villefort had been pronounced but then she became pale and rising as if touched by a spring she stretched out her hand as though conjuring an apparition she then took two or three step towards her husband as though to tear the secret from him of which he was ignorant or which he withheld from some odious calculation odious as all his calculations were m
de m_noirtier_de_villefort what do you mean â i mean that de nargonne your first husband being neither a philosopher nor a banker or perhaps being both and seeing there was nothing to be got out of a kingâ attorney died of grief or anger at finding after an absence of nine month that you had been enceinte six i am brutal i not only allow it but boast of it it is one of the reasons of my success in commercial business why did he kill himself instead of you because he had no cash to save my life belongs to my cash m_lucien_debray has made me lose 700 000 franc let him bear his share of the loss and we will go on as before if not let him become bankrupt for the 250 000 livres and do as all bankrupts doâ disappear he is a charming fellow i allow when his news is correct but when it is not there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was rooted to the spot she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack but she fell upon a chair thinking of m_noirtier_de_villefort of the dinner scene of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house_of_peers during the last few day and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars did not even look at her though she did her best to faint he shut the bedroom door after him without adding another word and returned to his apartments and when madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars recovered from her half fainting condition she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable dream chapter 66 matrimonial projects
the day following this scene at the hour m_lucien_debray usually chose to pay a visit to madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars on his way to his office his coupã did not appear at this time that is about half past twelve madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars ordered her carriage and went out mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars hidden behind a curtain watched the departure he had been waiting for he gave order that he should be informed as soon as madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars appeared but at two oâ clock she had not returned he then called for his horse drove to the chamber and inscribed his name to speak against the budget from twelve to two oâ clock mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had remained in his study unsealing his dispatches and becoming more and more sad every minute heaping figure upon figure and receiving among other visits one from major m_andrea_cavalcanti who as stiff and exact as ever presented himself precisely at the hour named the night before to terminate his business with the banker on leaving the chamber mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who had shown violent marks of agitation during the sitting and been more bitter than ever against the ministry re entered his carriage and told the coachman to drive to the avenue des champs lysã es no 30 count_of_monte_cristo was at home only he was engaged with someone and begged mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars to wait for a moment in the drawing room while the banker was waiting in the anteroom the door opened and a man dressed as an abbã and doubtless more familiar with the house_of_peers than he was came in and instead of waiting merely bowed passed on to the farther apartments and disappeared a minute after the door by which the priest had entered reopened and count_of_monte_cristo appeared pardon
me said he my dear baron but one of my friend the abbã_busoni whom you perhaps saw pass by has just arrived in paris not having seen him for a long time i could not make up my mind to leave him sooner so i hope this will be sufficient reason for my having made you wait â nay said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â_it is my fault i have chosen my visit at a wrong time and will retire â not at all on the contrary be seated but what is the matter with you you look careworn really you alarm me melancholy in a capitalist like the appearance of a comet presages some misfortune to the world â i have been in ill luck for several day said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and i have heard nothing but bad news â ah indeed said count_of_monte_cristo have you had another fall at the bourse â no i am safe for a few day at least i am only annoyed about a bankrupt of trieste â really does it happen to be jacopo_manfredi â exactly so imagine a man who has transacted business with me for i donâ know how long to the amount of 800 000 or 900 000 franc during the year never a mistake or delayâ a fellow who paid like a prince well i was a million in advance with him and now my fine jacopo_manfredi suspends payment â really â_it is an unheard of fatality i draw upon him for 600 000 franc my bills are returned unpaid and more than that i hold bills of exchange signed by him to the value of 400 000 franc payable at his correspondentâ in paris at the end of this month today is the 30th i present them but my correspondent has disappeared
this with my spanish affairs made a pretty end to the month â then you really lost by that affair in spain â_yes only 700 000 franc out of my cash boxâ nothing more â why how could you make such a mistakeâ such an old stager â_oh it is all my wifeâ fault she dreamed don_carlos had returned to spain she believes in dreams it is magnetism she says and when she dreams a thing it is sure to happen she assures me on this conviction i allow her to speculate she having her bank and her stockbroker she speculated and lost it is true she speculates with her own money not mine nevertheless you can understand that when 700 000 franc leave the wifeâ pocket the husband always finds it out but do you mean to say you have not heard of this why the thing has made a tremendous noise â_yes i heard it spoken of but i did not know the details and then no one can be more ignorant than i am of the affairs in the bourse 30251m then you do not speculate â i how could i speculate when i already have so much trouble in regulating my income i should be obliged besides my steward to keep a clerk and a boy but touching these spanish affairs i think that the baroness did not dream the whole of the don_carlos matter the paper said something about it did they not â then you believe the paper â i not the least in the world only i fancied that the honest messager was an exception to the rule and that it only announced telegraphic despatches â well thatâ s
what puzzles me replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars the news of the return of don_carlos was brought by telegraph â so that said count_of_monte_cristo you have lost nearly 700 000 franc this month â not nearly indeed that is exactly my loss â diable said count_of_monte_cristo compassionately â_it is a hard blow for a third rate fortune â third rate said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars rather humble what do you mean by that â certainly continued count_of_monte_cristo i make three assortments in fortuneâ first rate second rate and third rate fortune i call those first rate which are composed of treasures one possesses under oneâ hand such as mines lands and funded property in such states as france austria and england provided these treasures and property form a total of about a hundred millions i call those second rate fortune that are gained by manufacturing enterprises joint stock companies viceroyalties and principalities not drawing more than 500 000 franc the whole forming a capital of about fifty millions finally i call those third rate fortune which are composed of a fluctuating capital dependent upon the will of others or upon chances which a bankruptcy involves or a false telegram shakes such as banks speculations of the dayâ in fact all operations under the influence of greater or less mischances the whole bringing in a real or fictitious capital of about fifteen millions i think this is about your position is it not â confound it yes replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars the result then of six more such month as this would be to reduce the third rate house_of_peers to despair â_oh said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars becoming very pale how you are running on â let us imagine seven such month continued count_of_monte_cristo in the same tone tell me have you ever thought that seven time 700 000 franc make nearly twelve millions
no you have not well you are right for if you indulged in such reflections you would never risk your principal which is to the speculator what the skin is to civilized man we have our clothes some more splendid than others this is our credit but when a man dies he has only his skin in the same way on retiring from business you have nothing but your real principal of about five or six millions at the most for third rate fortune are never more than a fourth of what they appear to be like the locomotive on a railway the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam surrounding it well out of the five or six millions which form your real capital you have just lost nearly two millions which must of course in the same degree diminish your credit and fictitious fortune to follow out my simile your skin has been opened by bleeding and this if repeated three or four time will cause deathâ so pay attention to it my dear monsieur_albert mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars do you want money do you wish me to lend you some 30253m what a bad calculator you are exclaimed mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars calling to his assistance all his philosophy and dissimulation i have made money at the same time by speculations which have succeeded i have made up the loss of blood by nutrition i lost a battle in spain i have been defeated in trieste but my naval army in india will have taken some galleons and my mexican pioneers will have discovered some mine â very good very good
but the wound remains and will reopen at the first loss â no for i am only embarked in certainties replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises to involve me three governments must crumble to dust â well such thing have been â that there should be a famine â recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine â or that the sea should become dry as in the day of pharaoh and even then my vessels would become caravans â so much the better i congratulate you my dear mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars said count_of_monte_cristo i see i was deceived and that you belong to the class of second rate fortune â i think i may aspire to that honor said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with a smile which reminded count_of_monte_cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond of daubing into their pictures of ruins but while we are speaking of business mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars added pleased to find an opportunity of changing the subject tell me what i am to do for m_andrea_cavalcanti â give him money if he is recommended to you and the recommendation seems good â excellent he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40 000 franc payable at sight on you signed by abbã_busoni and returned by you to me with your endorsementâ of course i immediately counted him over the forty bank notes count_of_monte_cristo nodded his head in token of assent but that is not all continued mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars he has opened an account with my house_of_peers for his son â may i ask how much he allows the young man â five thousand franc per month â sixty thousand franc per year i thought i was right in believing that m_andrea_cavalcanti to be a stingy fellow
how can a young man live upon 000 franc a month â but you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands moreâ â do not advance it the father will never repay it you do not know these ultramontane millionaires they are regular misers and by whom were they recommended to you â_oh by the house_of_peers of fenzi one of the best in florence â i do not mean to say you will lose but nevertheless mind you hold to the terms of the agreement â would you not trust the m_andrea_cavalcanti â i oh i would advance ten millions on his signature i was only speaking in reference to the second rate fortune we were mentioning just now â and with all this how unassuming he is i should never have taken him for anything more than a mere major â and you would have flattered him for certainly as you say he has no manner the first time i saw him he appeared to me like an old lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets but all the italians are the same they are like old jews when they are not glittering in oriental splendor â the young man is better said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â_yes a little nervous perhaps but upon the whole he appeared tolerable i was uneasy about him â why â because you met him at my house_of_peers just after his introduction into the world as they told me he has been travelling with a very severe tutor and had never been to paris before â ah i believe noblemen marry amongst themselves do they not asked mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars carelessly they like to unite their fortune â_it is usual certainly but m_andrea_cavalcanti is an original who does nothing like other people
i cannot help thinking that he has brought his son to france to choose a wife â do you think so â i am sure of it â and you have heard his fortune mentioned â nothing else was talked of only some said he was worth millions and others that he did not possess a farthing â and what is your opinion â i ought not to influence you because it is only my own personal impression â well and it is thatâ â my opinion is that all these old podestã these ancient condottieri for the m_andrea_cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed provinces my opinion i say is that they have buried their millions in corners the secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest son who have done the same from generation to generation and the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance like the florins of the republic which from being constantly gazed upon have become reflected in them â certainly said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of land â very little at least i know of none which m_andrea_cavalcanti possesses excepting his palace in lucca â ah he has a palace said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars laughing come that is something â_yes and more than that he lets it to the minister of finance while he life in a simple house_of_peers oh as i told you before i think the old fellow is very close â come you do not flatter him â i scarcely know him i think i have seen him three time in my life all i know relating to him is through abbã_busoni and himself
he was telling me this morning that tired of letting his property lie dormant in italy which is a dead nation he wished to find a method either in france or england of multiplying his millions but remember that though i place great confidence in abbã_busoni i am not responsible for this â never mind accept my thanks for the client you have sent me it is a fine name to inscribe on my ledgers and my cashier was quite proud of it when i explained to him who the m_andrea_cavalcanti were by the way this is merely a simple question when this sort of people marry their son do they give them any fortune â_oh that depends upon circumstances i know an italian prince rich as a gold mine one of the noblest families in tuscany who when his son married according to his wish gave them millions and when they married against his consent merely allowed them thirty crowns a month should m_andrea_cavalcanti marry according to his fatherâ views he will perhaps give him one two or three millions for example supposing it were the daughter of a banker he might take an interest in the house_of_peers of the father in law of his son then again if he disliked his choice the major takes the key double locks his coffer and master m_andrea_cavalcanti would be obliged to live like the son of a parisian family by shuffling cards or rattling the dice â ah that boy will find out some bavarian or peruvian princess he will want a crown an el dorado and potosã â no these grand lords on the other side of the alps frequently marry into plain families like jupiter they like to cross the race
but do you wish to marry m_andrea_cavalcanti my dear mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars that you are asking so many questions â ma foi said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â_it would not be a bad speculation i fancy and you know i am a speculator â you are not thinking of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i hope you would not like poor m_andrea_cavalcanti to have his throat cut by monsieur_albert â monsieur_albert repeated mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars shrugging his shoulders ah well he would care very little about it i think â but he is betrothed to your daughter i believe â well de viscount_albert_de_morcerf and i have talked about this marriage but madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf and albertâ â you do not mean to say that it would not be a good match â indeed i imagine that mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is as good as de viscount_albert_de_morcerf â mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars danglarsâ fortune will be great no doubt especially if the telegraph should not make any more mistakes â_oh i do not mean her fortune only but tell meâ â what â why did you not invite and madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf to your dinner â i did so but he excused himself on account of madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf being obliged to go to dieppe for the benefit of sea air â_yes yes said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars laughing â_it would do her a great deal of good â why so â because it is the air she always breathed in her youth count_of_monte_cristo took no notice of this ill natured remark but still if monsieur_albert be not so rich as mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars said the count you must allow that he has a fine name â so
he has but i like mine as well â certainly your name is popular and does honor to the title they have adorned it with but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a prejudice too firmly rooted to be exterminated a nobility which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon twenty year â and for this very reason said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with a smile which he tried to make sardonic i prefer m_andrea_cavalcanti to monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf â still i should not think the morcerfs would yield to the m_andrea_cavalcanti â the morcerfs stay my dear count said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars you are a man of the world are you not â i think so â and you understand heraldry â a little â well look at my coat of arm it is worth more than morcerfâ â why so â because though i am not a baron by birth my real name is at least mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â well what then â while his name is not viscount_albert_de_morcerf â how not viscount_albert_de_morcerf â not the least in the world â go on â i have been made a baron so that i actually am one he made himself a count so that he is not one at all â impossible â listen my dear count de viscount_albert_de_morcerf has been my friend or rather my acquaintance during the last thirty year you know i have made the most of my arm though i never forgot my origin â a proof of great humility or great pride said count_of_monte_cristo well when i was a clerk viscount_albert_de_morcerf was a mere fisherman â and then he was calledâ â m_fernand_mondego â only m_fernand_mondego â m_fernand_mondego â you are sure â pardieu i have bought enough fish of him to know his name â then
why did you think of giving your daughter to him â because m_fernand_mondego and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars being both parvenus both having become noble both rich are about equal in worth excepting that there have been certain thing mentioned of him that were never said of me â what â_oh nothing â ah yes what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of m_fernand_mondego i have heard that name in greece â in conjunction with the affairs of ali_pasha_of_yanina â exactly so â this is the mystery said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i acknowledge i would have given anything to find it out â_it would be very easy if you much wished it â how so â probably you have some correspondent in greece â i should think so â at ali_pasha_of_yanina â everywhere â well write to your correspondent in ali_pasha_of_yanina and ask him what part was played by a frenchman named m_fernand_mondego in the catastrophe of ali_pasha_of_yanina tepelini â you are right exclaimed mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars rising quickly i will write today â do so â i will 30259m and if you should hear of anything very scandalousâ â i will communicate it to you â you will oblige me mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars rushed out of the room and made but one leap into his coupã chapter 67 the office of the kingâ attorney let us leave the banker driving his horse at their fullest speed and follow madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars in her morning excursion we have said that at half past twelve oâ clock madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had ordered her horse and had left home in the carriage she directed her course towards the faubourg saint germain went down the rue mazarine and stopped at the passage du pont neuf she descended and went through the passage she was very plainly dressed as would be the case with a woman of taste walking in the morning
at the rue guã nã gaud she called a cab and directed the driver to go to the rue de harlay as soon as she was seated in the vehicle she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil which she tied on to her straw bonnet she then replaced the bonnet and saw with pleasure in a little pocket mirror that her white complexion and brilliant eye were alone visible the cab crossed the pont neuf and entered the rue de harlay by the place dauphine the driver was paid as the door opened and stepping lightly up the stairs madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars soon reached the salle des pas perdus there was a great deal going on that morning and many business like person at the palais business like person pay very little attention to woman and madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer there was a great press of people in de villefortâ antechamber but madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name the instant she appeared the door keeper rose came to her and asked her whether she was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment and on her affirmative answer being given he conducted her by a private passage to de villefortâ office the magistrate was seated in an armchair writing with his back towards the door he did not move as he heard it open and the door keeper pronounce the word walk in madame and then reclose it but no sooner had the manâ footsteps ceased than he started up drew the bolts closed the curtains and examined every corner of the room
then when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and was consequently relieved of doubts he said thanks madame thanks for your punctuality and he offered a chair to madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars which she accepted for her heart beat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated 30261m â_it is a long time madame said the procureur describing a half circle with his chair so as to place himself exactly opposite to madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â_it is a long time since i had the pleasure of speaking alone with you and i regret that we have only now met to enter upon a painful conversation â nevertheless sir you see i have answered your first appeal although certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for you m_noirtier_de_villefort smiled bitterly â_it is true then he said rather uttering his thoughts aloud than addressing his companion â_it is true then that all our actions leave their tracesâ some sad others brightâ on our paths it is true that every step in our life is like the course of an insect on the sands â_it leaves its track alas to many the path is traced by tears â sir said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars you can feel for my emotion can you not spare me then i beseech you when i look at this room whence so many guilty creatures have departed trembling and ashamed when i look at that chair before which i now sit trembling and ashamed â_oh it requires all my reason to convince me that i am not a very guilty woman and you a menacing judge m_noirtier_de_villefort dropped his head and sighed and i he said i feel that my place is not in the judgeâ seat but on the prisonerâ bench 30263m you said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars
â yes i â i think sir you exaggerate your situation said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars whose beautiful eye sparkled for a moment the paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young man of ardent imaginations besides the pleasure there is always remorse from the indulgence of our passions and after all what have you man to fear from all this the world excuses and notoriety ennobles you â madame replied m_noirtier_de_villefort you know that i am no hypocrite or at least that i never deceive without a reason if my brow be severe it is because many misfortunes have clouded it if my heart be petrified it is that it might sustain the blows it has received i was not so in my youth i was not so on the night of the betrothal when we were all seated around a table in the rue du cours at marseilles but since then everything has changed in and about me i am accustomed to brave difficulties and in the conflict to crush those who by their own free will or by chance voluntarily or involuntarily interfere with me in my career it is generally the case that what we most ardently desire is as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it or from whom we attempt to snatch it thus the greater number of a manâ errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity then after error has been committed in a moment of excitement of delirium or of fear we see that we might have avoided and escaped it
the means we might have used which we in our blindness could not see then seem simple and easy and we say why did i not do this instead of that woman on the contrary are rarely tormented with remorse for the decision does not come from you your misfortunes are generally imposed upon you and your faults the results of othersâ crimes â in any case sir you will allow replied madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars that even if the fault were alone mine i last night received a severe punishment for it â poor thing said m_noirtier_de_villefort pressing her hand â_it was too severe for your strength for you were twice overwhelmed and yetâ â well â well i must tell you collect all your courage for you have not yet heard all â ah exclaimed madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars alarmed what is there more to hear â you only look back to the past and it is indeed bad enough well picture to yourself a future more gloomy stillâ certainly frightful perhaps sanguinary the baroness knew how calm m_noirtier_de_villefort naturally was and his present excitement frightened her so much that she opened her mouth to scream but the sound died in her throat how has this terrible past been recalled cried m_noirtier_de_villefort how is it that it has escaped from the depths of the tomb and the recesses of our heart where it was buried to visit us now like a phantom whitening our cheeks and flushing our brows with shame â alas said hermine doubtless it is chance â chance replied m_noirtier_de_villefort no no madame there is no such thing as chance â_oh yes has not a fatal chance revealed all this was it not by chance the count_of_monte_cristo bought that house_of_peers was it not by chance he caused the earth to be dug up
is it not by chance that the unfortunate child was disinterred under the trees that poor innocent offspring of mine which i never even kissed but for whom i wept many many tears ah my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear spoil found beneath the flowers â well no madame this is the terrible news i have to tell you said m_noirtier_de_villefort in a hollow voiceâ no nothing was found beneath the flowers there was no child disinterredâ no you must not weep no you must not groan you must tremble â what can you mean asked madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars shuddering i mean that de count_of_monte_cristo digging underneath these trees found neither skeleton nor chest because neither of them was there â neither of them there repeated madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars her staring wide open eye expressing her alarm neither of them there she again said as though striving to impress herself with the meaning of the word which escaped her no said m_noirtier_de_villefort burying his face in his hand no a hundred time no â then you did not bury the poor child there sir why did you deceive me where did you place it tell meâ where â there but listen to meâ listenâ and you will pity me who has for twenty year alone borne the heavy burden of grief i am about to reveal without casting the least portion upon you â_oh you frighten me but speak i will listen â you recollect that sad night when you were half expiring on that bed in the red damask room while i scarcely less agitated than you awaited your delivery
the child was born was given to meâ motionless breathless voiceless we thought it dead madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars moved rapidly as though she would spring from her chair but m_noirtier_de_villefort stopped and clasped his hand as if to implore her attention we thought it dead he repeated i placed it in the chest which was to take the place of a coffin i descended to the garden i dug a hole and then flung it down in haste scarcely had i covered it with earth when the arm of the corsican was stretched towards me i saw a shadow rise and at the same time a flash of light i felt pain i wished to cry out but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice i fell lifeless and fancied myself killed never shall i forget your sublime courage when having returned to consciousness i dragged myself to the foot of the stairs and you almost dying yourself came to meet me we were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful catastrophe you had the fortitude to regain the house_of_peers assisted by your nurse a duel was the pretext for my wound though we scarcely expected it our secret remained in our own keeping alone i was taken to versailles for three month i struggled with death at last as i seemed to cling to life i was ordered to the south four man carried me from paris to chã lons walking six leagues a day madame m_noirtier_de_villefort followed the litter in her carriage at chã lons i was put upon the saã ne thence i passed on to the rhã ne whence i descended merely with the current to arles at arles i was again placed on my litter and continued my journey to marseilles my recovery lasted six month
i never heard you mentioned and i did not dare inquire for you when i returned to paris i learned that you the widow of de nargonne had married mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars what was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness returned to me always the sameâ always the childâ corpse coming every night in my dreams rising from the earth and hovering over the grave with menacing look and gesture i inquired immediately on my return to paris the house_of_peers had not been inhabited since we left it but it had just been let for nine year i found the tenant i pretended that i disliked the idea that a house_of_peers belonging to my wifeâ father and mother should pass into the hand of strangers i offered to pay them for cancelling the lease they demanded 000 franc i would have given 10 000â i would have given 20 000 i had the money with me i made the tenant sign the deed of resilition and when i had obtained what i so much wanted i galloped to auteuil no one had entered the house_of_peers since i had left it â_it was five oâ clock in the afternoon i ascended into the red room and waited for night there all the thoughts which had disturbed me during my year of constant agony came back with double force the corsican who had declared the vendetta against me who had followed me from nã mes to paris who had hid himself in the garden who had struck me had seen me dig the grave had seen me inter the child he might become acquainted with your person nay he might even then have known it would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret
would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that i had not died from the blow of his dagger it was therefore necessary before everything else and at all risks that i should cause all traces of the past to disappearâ that i should destroy every material vestige too much reality would always remain in my recollection it was for this i had annulled the leaseâ it was for this i had comeâ it was for this i was waiting night arrived i allowed it to become quite dark i was without a light in that room when the wind shook all the door behind which i continually expected to see some spy concealed i trembled i seemed everywhere to hear your moans behind me in the bed and i dared not turn around my heart beat so violently that i feared my wound would open at length one by one all the noises in the neighborhood ceased i understood that i had nothing to fear that i should neither be seen nor heard so i decided upon descending to the garden listen hermine i consider myself as brave as most man but when i drew from my breast the little key of the staircase which i had found in my coatâ that little key we both used to cherish so much which you wished to have fastened to a golden ringâ when i opened the door and saw the pale moon shedding a long stream of white light on the spiral staircase like a spectre i leaned against the wall and nearly shrieked i seemed to be going mad at last i mastered my agitation i descended the staircase step by step the only thing i could not conquer was a strange trembling in my knees
i grasped the railings if i had relaxed my hold for a moment i should have fallen i reached the lower door outside this door a spade was placed against the wall i took it and advanced towards the thicket i had provided myself with a dark lantern in the middle of the lawn i stopped to light it then i continued my path â_it was the end of november all the verdure of the garden had disappeared the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long bony arm and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my foot my terror overcame me to such a degree as i approached the thicket that i took a pistol from my pocket and armed myself i fancied continually that i saw the figure of the corsican between the branches i examined the thicket with my dark lantern it was empty i looked carefully around i was indeed alone no noise disturbed the silence but the owl whose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night i tied my lantern to a forked branch i had noticed a year before at the precise spot where i stopped to dig the hole the grass had grown very thickly there during the summer and when autumn arrived no one had been there to mow it still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention it evidently was there i had turned up the ground i went to work the hour then for which i had been waiting during the last year had at length arrived how i worked how i hoped how i struck every piece of turf thinking to find some resistance to my spade
but no i found nothing though i had made a hole twice as large as the first i thought i had been deceivedâ had mistaken the spot i turned around i looked at the trees i tried to recall the details which had struck me at the time a cold sharp wind whistled through the leafless branches and yet the drops fell from my forehead i recollected that i was stabbed just as i was trampling the ground to fill up the hole while doing so i had leaned against a laburnum behind me was an artificial rockery intended to serve as a resting place for person walking in the garden in falling my hand relaxing its hold of the laburnum felt the coldness of the stone on my right i saw the tree behind me the rock i stood in the same attitude and threw myself down i rose and again began digging and enlarging the hole still i found nothing nothingâ the chest was no longer there 30269m the chest no longer there murmured madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars choking with fear think not i contented myself with this one effort continued m_noirtier_de_villefort no i searched the whole thicket i thought the assassin having discovered the chest and supposing it to be a treasure had intended carrying it off but perceiving his error had dug another hole and deposited it there but i could find nothing then the idea struck me that he had not taken these precautions and had simply thrown it in a corner in the last case i must wait for daylight to renew my search i remained in the room and waited â_oh heaven 30271m when daylight dawned i went down again my first visit was to the thicket
i hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the darkness i had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty foot square and a depth of two foot a laborer would not have done in a day what occupied me an hour but i could find nothingâ absolutely nothing then i renewed the search supposing it had been thrown aside it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate but this examination was as useless as the first and with a bursting heart i returned to the thicket which now contained no hope for me â_oh cried madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â_it was enough to drive you mad â i hoped for a moment that it might said m_noirtier_de_villefort but that happiness was denied me however recovering my strength and my idea why said i should that man have carried away the corpse â but you said replied madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars he would require it as a proof â ah no madame that could not be dead bodies are not kept a year they are shown to a magistrate and the evidence is taken now nothing of the kind has happened â what then asked hermine trembling violently something more terrible more fatal more alarming for usâ the child was perhaps alive and the assassin may have saved it madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars uttered a piercing cry and seizing villefortâ hand exclaimed my child was alive said she you buried my child alive you were not certain my child was dead and you buried it ahâ â madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had risen and stood before the procureur whose hand she wrung in her feeble grasp
â i know not i merely suppose so as i might suppose anything else replied m_noirtier_de_villefort with a look so fixed it indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and madness ah my child my poor child cried the baroness falling on her chair and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief m_noirtier_de_villefort becoming somewhat reassured perceived that to avert the maternal storm gathering over his head he must inspire madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with the terror he felt you understand then that if it were so said he rising in his turn and approaching the baroness to speak to her in a lower tone we are lost this child life and someone knows it livesâ someone is in possession of our secret and since count_of_monte_cristo speaks before us of a child disinterred when that child could not be found it is he who is in possession of our secret â just god avenging god murmured madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars villefortâ only answer was a stifled groan but the childâ the child sir repeated the agitated mother how i have searched for him replied m_noirtier_de_villefort wringing his hand how i have called him in my long sleepless night how i have longed for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of man and to find mine among them at last one day when for the hundredth time i took up my spade i asked myself again and again what the corsican could have done with the child a child encumbers a fugitive perhaps on perceiving it was still alive he had thrown it into the river â impossible cried madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars
â a man may murder another out of revenge but he would not deliberately drown a child â perhaps continued m_noirtier_de_villefort he had put it in the foundling hospital â_oh yes yes cried the baroness my child is there â i ran to the hospital and learned that the same nightâ the night of the 20th of septemberâ a child had been brought there wrapped in part of a fine linen napkin purposely torn in half this portion of the napkin was marked with half a baronâ crown and the letter â truly truly said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars all my linen is marked thus monsieur_albert de nargonne was a baron and my name is hermine thank god my child was not then dead â no it was not dead â and you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy where is the child m_noirtier_de_villefort shrugged his shoulders do i know said he and do you believe that if i knew i would relate to you all its trials and all its adventures as would a dramatist or a novel writer alas no i know not a woman about six month after came to claim it with the other half of the napkin this woman gave all the requisite particulars and it was intrusted to her â but you should have inquired for the woman you should have traced her â and what do you think i did i feigned a criminal process and employed all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of her they traced her to chã lons and there they lost her â they lost her â_yes forever madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had listened to this recital with a sigh a tear or a shriek for every detail and this is all said she and you stopped there â_oh no
â said m_noirtier_de_villefort i never ceased to search and to inquire however the last two or three year i had allowed myself some respite but now i will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever since fear urges me not my conscience â but replied madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars the count_of_monte_cristo can know nothing or he would not seek our society as he does â_oh the wickedness of man is very great said m_noirtier_de_villefort since it surpasses the goodness of god did you observe that manâ eye while he was speaking to us â no â but have you ever watched him carefully â doubtless he is capricious but that is all one thing alone struck me of all the exquisite thing he placed before us he touched nothing i might have suspected he was poisoning us â and you see you would have been deceived â_yes doubtless â but believe me that man has other projects for that reason i wished to see you to speak to you to warn you against everyone but especially against him tell me cried m_noirtier_de_villefort fixing his eye more steadfastly on her than he had ever done before did you ever reveal to anyone our connection â never to anyone â you understand me replied m_noirtier_de_villefort affectionately when i say anyone pardon my urgency to anyone living i mean â_yes yes i understand very well ejaculated the baroness never i swear to you â were you ever in the habit of writing in the evening what had transpired in the morning do you keep a journal â no my life has been passed in frivolity i wish to forget it myself â do you talk in your sleep 30275m i sleep soundly like a child do you not remember the color mounted to the baronessâ face and m_noirtier_de_villefort turned awfully pale
â it is true said he in so low a tone that he could hardly be heard well said the baroness well i understand what i now have to do replied m_noirtier_de_villefort in less than one week from this time i will ascertain who this de count_of_monte_cristo is whence he comes where he goes and why he speaks in our presence of child that have been disinterred in a garden m_noirtier_de_villefort pronounced these word with an accent which would have made the count shudder had he heard him then he pressed the hand the baroness reluctantly gave him and led her respectfully back to the door madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars returned in another cab to the passage on the other side of which she found her carriage and her coachman sleeping peacefully on his box while waiting for her chapter 68 a summer ball the same day during the interview between madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and the procureur a travelling carriage entered the rue du helder passed through the gateway of no 27 and stopped in the yard in a moment the door was opened and madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf alighted leaning on her sonâ arm monsieur_albert soon left her ordered his horse and having arranged his toilet drove to the champs lysã es to the house_of_peers of count_of_monte_cristo the count received him with his habitual smile it was a strange thing that no one ever appeared to advance a step in that manâ favor those who would as it were force a passage to his heart found an impassable barrier viscount_albert_de_morcerf who ran towards him with open arm was chilled as he drew near in spite of the friendly smile and simply held out his hand count_of_monte_cristo shook it coldly according to his invariable practice
â here i am dear count â welcome home again â i arrived an hour since â from dieppe â no from trã port â indeed â and i have come at once to see you â that is extremely kind of you said count_of_monte_cristo with a tone of perfect indifference and what is the news â you should not ask a stranger a foreigner for news â i know it but in asking for news i mean have you done anything for me â had you commissioned me said count_of_monte_cristo feigning uneasiness come come said monsieur_albert do not assume so much indifference it is said sympathy travels rapidly and when at trã port i felt the electric shock you have either been working for me or thinking of me â possibly said count_of_monte_cristo i have indeed thought of you but the magnetic wire i was guiding acted indeed without my knowledge 30277m indeed pray tell me how it happened â willingly mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars dined with me â i know it to avoid meeting him my mother and i left town â but he met here m_andrea_cavalcanti â your italian prince â not so fast m_andrea_cavalcanti only calls himself count â calls himself do you say â_yes calls himself â is he not a count â what can i know of him he calls himself so i of course give him the same title and everyone else does likewise â what a strange man you are what next you say mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars dined here â_yes with count m_andrea_cavalcanti the marquis his father madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and madame m_noirtier_de_villefort charming people m_lucien_debray m_maximilian_morrel and de baron_de_chã_teau_renaud â did they speak of me â not a word â so much the worse â why so i thought you wished them to forget you â if
they did not speak of me i am sure they thought about me and i am in despair â how will that affect you since mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was not among the number here who thought of you truly she might have thought of you at home â i have no fear of that or if she did it was only in the same way in which i think of her â touching sympathy so you hate each other said the count listen said morcerfâ if mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars were disposed to take pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account and would dispense with all matrimonial formalities between our two families i am ready to agree to the arrangement in a word mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars would make a charming mistressâ but a wifeâ diable â and this said count_of_monte_cristo is your opinion of your intended spouse â_yes it is rather unkind i acknowledge but it is true but as this dream cannot be realized since mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars must become my lawful wife live perpetually with me sing to me compose verses and music within ten paces of me and that for my whole life it frightens me one may forsake a mistress but a wife good heavens there she must always be and to marry mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars would be awful â you are difficult to please viscount â_yes for i often wish for what is impossible â what is that â to find such a wife as my father found count_of_monte_cristo turned pale and looked at monsieur_albert while playing with some magnificent pistols your father was fortunate then said he you know my opinion of my mother count look at her still beautiful witty more charming than ever
for any other son to have stayed with his mother for four day at trã port it would have been a condescension or a martyrdom while i return more contented more peacefulâ shall i say more poetic than if i had taken queen mab or titania as my companion 30279m that is an overwhelming demonstration and you would make everyone vow to live a single life â such are my reasons for not liking to marry mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it the diamond which glittered in the window at marlã s or fossinâ shines with more splendor when it is our own but if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another and still must retain the one that is inferior do you not know what we have to endure â worldling murmured the count thus i shall rejoice when mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars perceives i am but a pitiful atom with scarcely as many hundred thousand franc as she has millions count_of_monte_cristo smiled one plan occurred to me continued monsieur_albert m_franz_de_quesnel likes all that is eccentric i tried to make him fall in love with mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars but in spite of four letter written in the most alluring style he invariably answered my eccentricity may be great but it will not make me break my promise â that is what i call devoted friendship to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself monsieur_albert smiled apropos continued he m_franz_de_quesnel is coming soon but it will not interest you you dislike him i think â i said count_of_monte_cristo my dear viscount how have you discovered that i did not like m_franz_de_quesnel i like everyone â and
you include me in the expression everyoneâ many thanks â let us not mistake said count_of_monte_cristo i love everyone as god commands us to love our neighbor as christians but i thoroughly hate but a few let us return to m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay did you say he was coming â_yes summoned by m_noirtier_de_villefort who is apparently as anxious to get mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort married as mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is to see mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars settled it must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grown up daughter it seems to make one feverish and to raise oneâ pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done â but dâ pinay unlike you bears his misfortune patiently â still more he talks seriously about the matter puts on a white tie and speaks of his family he entertains a very high opinion of and madame m_noirtier_de_villefort â which they deserve do they not â i believe they do m_noirtier_de_villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man â there is then one said count_of_monte_cristo whom you do not condemn like poor mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â because i am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied monsieur_albert laughing indeed my dear sir said count_of_monte_cristo you are revoltingly foppish â i foppish how do you mean â_yes pray take a cigar and cease to defend yourself and to struggle to escape marrying mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars let thing take their course perhaps you may not have to retract â bah said monsieur_albert staring doubtless my dear viscount you will not be taken by force and seriously do you wish to break off your engagement â i would give a hundred thousand franc to be able to do so â then make yourself quite easy
m mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars would give double that sum to attain the same end â am i indeed so happy said monsieur_albert who still could not prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow but my dear count has mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars any reason â ah there is your proud and selfish nature you would expose the self love of another with a hatchet but you shrink if your own is attacked with a needle â but yet mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars appearedâ â delighted with you was he not well he is a man of bad taste and is still more enchanted with another i know not whom look and judge for yourself â thank you i understand but my motherâ no not my mother i mistakeâ my father intends giving a ball â a ball at this season â summer balls are fashionable â if they were not the countess has only to wish it and they would become so â you are right you know they are select affairs those who remain in paris in july must be true parisians will you take charge of our invitation to messieurs m_andrea_cavalcanti â when will it take place â on saturday â cavalcantiâ father will be gone â but the son will be here will you invite young m_andrea_cavalcanti â i do not know him viscount â you do not know him â no i never saw him until a few day since and am not responsible for him â but you receive him at your house_of_peers â that is another thing he was recommended to me by a good abbã who may be deceived give him a direct invitation but do not ask me to present him
if he were afterwards to marry mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars you would accuse me of intrigue and would be challenging me besides i may not be there myself â where â at your ball â why should you not be there â because you have not yet invited me â but i come expressly for that purpose â you are very kind but i may be prevented â if i tell you one thing you will be so amiable as to set aside all impediments â tell me what it is â my mother begs you to come â the comtesse de viscount_albert_de_morcerf said count_of_monte_cristo starting ah count said monsieur_albert i assure you madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf speaks freely to me and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which i spoke just now thrill within you you must be entirely devoid of them for during the last four day we have spoken of no one else â you have talked of me â_yes that is the penalty of being a living puzzle â then i am also a puzzle to your mother i should have thought her too reasonable to be led by imagination â a problem my dear count for everyoneâ for my mother as well as others much studied but not solved you still remain an enigma do not fear my mother is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved i believe while the countess gâ takes you for lord_ruthven my mother imagines you to be cagliostro or the count saint germain
the first opportunity you have confirm her in her opinion it will be easy for you as you have the philosophy of the one and the wit of the other â i thank you for the warning said the count i shall endeavor to be prepared for all suppositions â you will then come on saturday â_yes since madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf invites me â you are very kind â will mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars be there â he has already been invited by my father we shall try to persuade the great dâ aguesseau 11 m_noirtier_de_villefort to come but have not much hope of seeing him â never despair of anything says the proverb â do you dance count â i dance â_yes you it would not be astonishing â that is very well before one is over forty no i do not dance but i like to see others do so does madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf dance â never you can talk to her she so delights in your conversation â indeed 30283m â_yes truly and i assure you you are the only man of whom i have heard her speak with interest monsieur_albert rose and took his hat the count conducted him to the door i have one thing to reproach myself with said he stopping monsieur_albert on the step what is it â i have spoken to you indiscreetly about mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â on the contrary speak to me always in the same strain about him â i am glad to be reassured on that point apropos when do you aspect dâ pinay â five or six day hence at the latest â and when is he to be married â immediately on the arrival of and madame_de_saint_mã_ran â bring him to see me
although you say i do not like him i assure you i shall be happy to see him â i will obey your order my lord â good bye â until saturday when i may expect you may i not â_yes i promised you the count watched monsieur_albert waving his hand to him when he had mounted his phaeton count_of_monte_cristo turned and seeing monsieur_bertuccio what news said he she went to the palais replied the steward did she stay long there â an hour and a half â did she return home â directly â well my dear monsieur_bertuccio said the count i now advise you to go in quest of the little estate i spoke to you of in normandy monsieur_bertuccio bowed and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order he had received he started the same evening chapter 69 the inquiry m_noirtier_de_villefort kept the promise he had made to madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars to endeavor to find out how the count_of_monte_cristo had discovered the history of the house_of_peers at auteuil he wrote the same day for the required information to m_de_boville who from having been an inspector of prisons was promoted to a high office in the police and the latter begged for two day time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely to give him full particulars
at the end of the second day m_noirtier_de_villefort received the following note the person called the count_of_monte_cristo is an intimate acquaintance of lord_wilmore a rich foreigner who is sometimes seen in paris and who is there at this moment he is also known to the abbã_busoni a sicilian priest of high repute in the east where he has done much good m_noirtier_de_villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made respecting these two person his order were executed and the following evening he received these details the abbã who was in paris only for a month inhabited a small two storied house_of_peers behind saint sulpice there were two room on each floor and he was the only tenant the two lower room consisted of a dining room with a table chairs and side board of walnut and a wainscoted parlor without ornaments carpet or timepiece it was evident that the abbã limited himself to objects of strict necessity he preferred to use the sitting room upstairs which was more library than parlor and was furnished with theological books and parchments in which he delighted to bury himself for month at a time according to his valet de chambre his valet looked at the visitors through a sort of wicket and if their face were unknown to him or displeased him he replied that the abbã was not in paris an answer which satisfied most person because the abbã was known to be a great traveller besides whether at home or not whether in paris or cairo the abbã always left something to give away which the valet distributed through this wicket in his masterâ name the other room near the library was a bedroom
a bed without curtains four armchairs and a couch covered with yellow utrecht velvet composed with a prie dieu all its furniture lord_wilmore resided in rue fontaine saint georges he was one of those english tourists who consume a large fortune in travelling he hired the apartment in which he lived furnished passed only a few hour in the day there and rarely slept there one of his peculiarities was never to speak a word of french which he however wrote with great facility the day after this important information had been given to the kingâ attorney a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the rue fã rou and rapping at an olive green door asked if the abbã_busoni were within no he went out early this morning replied the valet i might not always be content with that answer replied the visitor for i come from one to whom everyone must be at home but have the kindness to give the abbã busoniâ â i told you he was not at home repeated the valet then on his return give him that card and this sealed paper will he be at home at eight oâ clock this evening â doubtless unless he is at work which is the same as if he were out â i will come again at that time replied the visitor who then retired at the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage which instead of stopping this time at the end of the rue fã rou drove up to the green door he knocked and it opened immediately to admit him from the signs of respect the valet paid him he saw that his note had produced a good effect is the abbã at home asked he
â yes he is at work in his library but he expects you sir replied the valet the stranger ascended a rough staircase and before a table illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness he perceived the abbã in a monkâ dress with a cowl on his head such as was used by learned man of the middle ages have i the honor of addressing the abbã_busoni asked the visitor â_yes sir replied the abbã and you are the person whom m_de_boville formerly an inspector of prisons sends to me from the prefect of police â exactly sir â one of the agents appointed to secure the safety of paris â_yes sirâ replied the stranger with a slight hesitation and blushing the abbã replaced the large spectacles which covered not only his eye but his temples and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the same i am at your service sir said the abbã with a marked italian accent the mission with which i am charged sir replied the visitor speaking with hesitation is a confidential one on the part of him who fulfils it and him by whom he is employed the abbã bowed your probity replied the stranger is so well known to the prefect that he wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars connected with the public safety to ascertain which i am deputed to see you it is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce you to conceal the truth â provided sir the particulars you wish for do not interfere with my scruples or my conscience
i am a priest sir and the secrets of confession for instance must remain between me and god and not between me and human justice â do not alarm yourself monsieur_albert we will duly respect your conscience at this moment the abbã pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other throwing a bright light on the strangerâ face while his own remained obscured excuse me abbã said the envoy of the prefect of the police but the light tries my eye very much the abbã lowered the shade now sir i am listeningâ go on â i will come at once to the point do you know the count_of_monte_cristo â you mean monsieur_albert zaccone i presume â zaccone is not his name count_of_monte_cristo â count_of_monte_cristo is the name of an estate or rather of a rock and not a family name â well be it soâ let us not dispute about word and since de count_of_monte_cristo and zaccone are the sameâ â absolutely the same â let us speak of zaccone â agreed â i asked you if you knew him â extremely well â who is he â the son of a rich shipbuilder in malta â i know that is the report but as you are aware the police does not content itself with vague reports â however replied the abbã with an affable smile when that report is in accordance with the truth everybody must believe it the police as well as all the rest â are you sure of what you assert
â what do you mean by that question â understand sir i do not in the least suspect your veracity i ask if you are certain of it â i knew his father zaccone â ah indeed â and when a child i often played with the son in the timber yards â but whence does he derive the title of count â you are aware that may be bought â in italy â everywhere â and his immense riches whence does he procure them â they may not be so very great â how much do you suppose he possesses â from one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per annum â that is reasonable said the visitor i have heard he had three or four millions â two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital â but i was told he had four millions per annum â that is not probable â do you know this island of count_of_monte_cristo â certainly everyone who has come from palermo naples or rome to france by sea must know it since he has passed close to it and must have seen it â i am told it is a delightful place â_it is a rock â and why has the count bought a rock â for the sake of being a count in italy one must have territorial possessions to be a count â you have doubtless heard the adventures of zacconeâ youth â the fatherâ â no the sonâ â i know nothing certain at that period of his life i lost sight of my young comrade
â was he in the wars â i think he entered the service â in what branch â in the navy â are you not his confessor â no sir i believe he is a lutheran â a lutheran â i say i believe such is the case i do not affirm it besides liberty of conscience is established in france â doubtless and we are not now inquiring into his creed but his actions in the name of the prefect of police i ask you what you know of him he passes for a very charitable man our holy father the pope has made him a knight of jesus christ for the services he rendered to the christians in the east he has five or six rings as testimonials from eastern monarchs of his services â does he wear them â no but he is proud of them he is better pleased with rewards given to the benefactors of man than to his destroyers â he is a quaker then â exactly he is a quaker with the exception of the peculiar dress â has he any friend â_yes everyone who knows him is his friend â but has he any enemies â one only â what is his name â lord_wilmore â where is he â he is in paris just now â can he give me any particulars â important one he was in india with zaccone â do you know his abode â itâ somewhere in the chaussã dâ antin but i know neither the street nor the number 30289m are you at variance with the englishman â i love zaccone and he hates him we are consequently not friend â do you think the count_of_monte_cristo had ever been in france before he made this visit to paris â to
that question i can answer positively no sir he had not because he applied to me six month ago for the particulars he required and as i did not know when i might again come to paris i recommended m_andrea_cavalcanti to him â m_andrea_cavalcanti â no bartolomeo_cavalcanti his father â now sir i have but one question more to ask and i charge you in the name of honor of humanity and of religion to answer me candidly â what is it sir â do you know with what design de count_of_monte_cristo purchased a house_of_peers at auteuil â certainly for he told me â what is it sir â to make a lunatic asylum of it similar to that founded by the count of pisani at palermo do you know about that institution â i have heard of it â_it is a magnificent charity having said this the abbã bowed to imply he wished to pursue his studies the visitor either understood the abbã s meaning or had no more questions to ask he arose and the abbã accompanied him to the door you are a great almsgiver said the visitor and although you are said to be rich i will venture to offer you something for your poor people will you accept my offering â i thank you sir i am only jealous in one thing and that is that the relief i give should be entirely from my own resources â howeverâ â my resolution sir is unchangeable but you have only to search for yourself and you will find alas but too many objects upon whom to exercise your benevolence the abbã once more bowed as he opened the door the stranger bowed and took his leave and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house_of_peers of m_noirtier_de_villefort
an hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered and this time it went to the rue fontaine saint georges and stopped at no where lord_wilmore lived the stranger had written to lord_wilmore requesting an interview which the latter had fixed for ten oâ clock as the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minute before ten he was told that lord_wilmore who was precision and punctuality personified was not yet come in but that he would be sure to return as the clock struck the visitor was introduced into the drawing room which was like all other furnished drawing room a mantle piece with two modern sã vres vases a timepiece representing cupid with his bent bow a mirror with an engraving on each sideâ one representing homer carrying his guide the other belisarius beggingâ a grayish paper red and black tapestryâ such was the appearance of lord wilmoreâ drawing room it was illuminated by lamps with ground glass shades which gave only a feeble light as if out of consideration for the envoyâ weak sight after ten minutesâ expectation the clock struck ten at the fifth stroke the door opened and lord_wilmore appeared he was rather above the middle height with thin reddish whiskers light complexion and light hair turning rather gray he was dressed with all the english peculiarity namely in a blue coat with gilt buttons and high collar in the fashion of 1811 a white kerseymere waistcoat and nankeen pantaloons three inches too short but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to the knee his first remark on entering was you know sir i do not speak french â i know you do not like to converse in our language replied the envoy but you may use it replied lord_wilmore i understand it
â and i replied the visitor changing his idiom know enough of english to keep up the conversation do not put yourself to the slightest inconvenience â aw said lord_wilmore with that tone which is only known to natives of great britain the envoy presented his letter of introduction which the latter read with english coolness and having finished i understand said he perfectly 30293m then began the questions which were similar to those which had been addressed to the abbã_busoni but as lord_wilmore in the character of the countâ enemy was less restrained in his answers they were more numerous he described the youth of count_of_monte_cristo who he said at ten year of age entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of india who make war on the english it was there lord_wilmore had first met him and fought against him and in that war zaccone had been taken prisoner sent to england and consigned to the hulks whence he had escaped by swimming then began his travels his duels his caprices then the insurrection in greece broke out and he had served in the grecian ranks while in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of thessaly but he had been careful to conceal it from everyone after the battle of navarino when the greek government was consolidated he asked of king otho a mining grant for that district which was given him hence that immense fortune which in lord wilmoreâ opinion possibly amounted to one or two millions per annum a precarious fortune which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine
â but asked the visitor do you know why he came to france â he is speculating in railways said lord_wilmore and as he is an expert chemist and physicist he has invented a new system of telegraphy which he is seeking to bring to perfection â how much does he spend yearly asked the prefect not more than five or six hundred thousand franc said lord_wilmore he is a miser hatred evidently inspired the englishman who knowing no other reproach to bring on the count accused him of avarice do you know his house_of_peers at auteuil â certainly â what do you know respecting it â do you wish to know why he bought it â_yes â the count is a speculator who will certainly ruin himself in experiments he supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house_of_peers he has bought a mineral spring equal to those at bagnã res luchon and cauterets he is going to turn his house_of_peers into a badhaus as the germans term it he has already dug up all the garden two or three time to find the famous spring and being unsuccessful he will soon purchase all the contiguous house now as i dislike him and hope his railway his electric telegraph or his search for baths will ruin him i am watching for his discomfiture which must soon take place â what was the cause of your quarrel â when he was in england he seduced the wife of one of my friend â why do you not seek revenge â i have already fought three duels with him said the englishman the first with the pistol the second with the sword and the third with the sabre â and what was the result of those duels
â the first time he broke my arm the second he wounded me in the breast and the third time made this large wound the englishman turned down his shirt collar and showed a scar whose redness proved it to be a recent one so that you see there is a deadly feud between us â but said the envoy you do not go about it in the right way to kill him if i understand you correctly â aw said the englishman i practice shooting every day and every other day grisier comes to my house_of_peers this was all the visitor wished to ascertain or rather all the englishman appeared to know the agent arose and having bowed to lord_wilmore who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the english he retired lord_wilmore having heard the door close after him returned to his bedroom where with one hand he pulled off his light hair his red whiskers his false jaw and his wound to resume the black hair dark complexion and pearly teeth of the count_of_monte_cristo it was m_noirtier_de_villefort and not the prefect who returned to the house_of_peers of m_noirtier_de_villefort the procureur felt more at ease although he had learned nothing really satisfactory and for the first time since the dinner party at auteuil he slept soundly chapter 70 the ball it was in the warmest day of july when in due course of time the saturday arrived upon which the ball was to take place at de morcerfâ
it was ten oâ clock at night the branches of the great trees in the garden of the countâ house_of_peers stood out boldly against the azure canopy of heaven which was studded with golden stars but where the last fleeting clouds of a vanishing storm yet lingered from the apartments on the ground floor might be heard the sound of music with the whirl of the waltz and galop while brilliant streams of light shone through the openings of the venetian blinds at this moment the garden was only occupied by about ten servant who had just received order from their mistress to prepare the supper the serenity of the weather continuing to increase until now it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the dining room or under a long tent erected on the lawn but the beautiful blue sky studded with stars had settled the question in favor of the lawn the gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns according to the italian custom and as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the tableâ the rarest of all luxuries in their complete formâ are well understood the supper table was loaded with wax light and flowers 30297m at the time the countess of viscount_albert_de_morcerf returned to the room after giving her order many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count for owing to the good taste of mercã_dã_s one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety had hesitated about going to madame de morcerfâ when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of m_noirtier_de_villefort
the latter made a sign and when the carriage had drawn close together said you are going to madame de morcerfâ are you not â no replied madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i am too ill â you are wrong replied m_noirtier_de_villefort significantly â_it is important that you should be seen there â do you think so asked the baroness i do â in that case i will go and the two carriage passed on towards their different destinations madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars therefore came not only beautiful in person but radiant with splendor she entered by one door at the time when mercã_dã_s appeared at the door the countess took monsieur_albert to meet madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars he approached paid her some well merited compliments on her toilet and offered his arm to conduct her to a seat monsieur_albert looked around him you are looking for my daughter said the baroness smiling i confess it replied monsieur_albert could you have been so cruel as not to bring her â calm yourself she has met mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort and has taken her arm see they are following us both in white dresses one with a bouquet of camellias the other with one of myosotis but tell meâ â well what do you wish to know â will not the count_of_monte_cristo be here tonight â seventeen replied monsieur_albert what do you mean â i only mean that the count seems the rage replied the viscount smiling and that you are the seventeenth person that has asked me the same question the count is in fashion i congratulate him upon it â and have you replied to everyone as you have to me â ah to be sure i have not answered you be satisfied we shall have this lionâ we are among the privileged one
â were you at the opera yesterday â no â he was there â ah indeed and did the eccentric person commit any new originality â can he be seen without doing so elssler was dancing in le diable boiteux the greek princess was in ecstasies after the cachucha he placed a magnificent ring on the stem of a bouquet and threw it to the charming danseuse who in the third act to do honor to the gift reappeared with it on her finger and the greek princess will she be here â no you will be deprived of that pleasure her position in the countâ establishment is not sufficiently understood â wait leave me here and go and speak to madame m_noirtier_de_villefort who is trying to attract your attention monsieur_albert bowed to madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and advanced towards madame m_noirtier_de_villefort whose lip opened as he approached i wager anything said monsieur_albert interrupting her that i know what you were about to say â well what is it â if i guess rightly will you confess it â_yes â on your honor â on my honor â you were going to ask me if the count_of_monte_cristo had arrived or was expected â not at all it is not of him that i am now thinking i was going to ask you if you had received any news of monsieur_albert m_franz_de_quesnel â_yes yesterday â what did he tell you â that he was leaving at the same time as his letter â well now then the count â the count will come of that you may be satisfied â you know that he has another name besides count_of_monte_cristo â no i did not know it â count_of_monte_cristo is the name of an island and he has
a family name â i never heard it â well then i am better informed than you his name is zaccone â_it is possible â he is a maltese â that is also possible the son of a shipowner â really you should relate all this aloud you would have the greatest success â he served in india discovered a mine in thessaly and comes to paris to establish a mineral water cure at auteuil â well iâ sure said viscount_albert_de_morcerf this is indeed news am i allowed to repeat it â_yes but cautiously tell one thing at a time and do not say i told you â why so â because it is a secret just discovered â by whom â the police â then the news originatedâ â at the prefectâ last night paris you can understand is astonished at the sight of such unusual splendor and the police have made inquiries â well well nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a vagabond on the pretext of his being too rich â indeed that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not been so favorable â poor count and is he aware of the danger he has been in â i think not â then it will be but charitable to inform him when he arrives i will not fail to do so just then a handsome young man with bright eye black hair and glossy moustache respectfully bowed to madame m_noirtier_de_villefort monsieur_albert extended his hand madame said monsieur_albert allow me to present to you m_maximilian_morrel captain of spahis one of our best and above all of our bravest officers â i have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at auteuil at the house_of_peers of the count_of_monte_cristo replied madame m_noirtier_de_villefort turning away with marked coldness of manner
this answer and especially the tone in which it was uttered chilled the heart of poor m_maximilian_morrel but a recompense was in store for him turning around he saw near the door a beautiful fair face whose large blue eye were without any marked expression fixed upon him while the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her lip the salutation was so well understood that m_maximilian_morrel with the same expression in his eye placed his handkerchief to his mouth and these two living statues whose heart beat so violently under their marble aspect separated from each other by the whole length of the room forgot themselves for a moment or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation they might have remained much longer lost in one another without anyone noticing their abstraction the count_of_monte_cristo had just entered we have already said that there was something in the count which attracted universal attention wherever he appeared it was not the coat unexceptional in its cut though simple and unornamented it was not the plain white waistcoat it was not the trousers that displayed the foot so perfectly formedâ it was none of these thing that attracted the attention â_it was his pale complexion his waving black hair his calm and serene expression his dark and melancholy eye his mouth chiselled with such marvellous delicacy which so easily expressed such high disdain these were what fixed the attention of all upon him many man might have been handsomer but certainly there could be none whose appearance was more significant if the expression may be used
everything about the count seemed to have its meaning for the constant habit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor to the expression of his face and even to the most trifling gesture scarcely to be understood yet the parisian world is so strange that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune 30301 meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery of curious glances towards madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf who standing before a mantle piece ornamented with flowers had seen his entrance in a looking glass placed opposite the door and was prepared to receive him she turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was bowing to her no doubt she fancied the count would speak to her while on his side the count thought she was about to address him but both remained silent and after a mere bow count_of_monte_cristo directed his step to monsieur_albert who received him cordially have you seen my mother asked monsieur_albert i have just had the pleasure replied the count but i have not seen your father â see he is down there talking politics with that little group of great geniuses â indeed said count_of_monte_cristo and so those gentlemen down there are man of great talent i should not have guessed it and for what kind of talent are they celebrated you know there are different sorts â that tall harsh looking man is very learned he discovered in the neighborhood of rome a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than lizards usually have and he immediately laid his discovery before the institute the thing was discussed for a long time but finally decided in his favor
i can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the learned world and the gentleman who was only a knight of the legion of honor was made an officer â come said count_of_monte_cristo this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded i suppose had he found another additional vertebra they would have made him a commander â very likely said monsieur_albert and who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green â_oh that coat is not his own idea it is the republicâ which deputed david12 to devise a uniform for the academicians â indeed said count_of_monte_cristo so this gentleman is an academician â within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly â and what is his especial talent â his talent i believe he thrusts pins through the head of rabbits he makes fowls eat madder and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with whalebone â and he is made a member of the academy of sciences for this â no of the french academy â but what has the french academy to do with all this â i was going to tell you it seemsâ â that his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of science doubtless â no that his style of writing is very good â this must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose head he has thrust pins to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red and to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out monsieur_albert laughed and the other one demanded the count that one â_yes the third
â the one in the dark blue coat â_yes â he is a colleague of the count and one of the most active opponents to the idea of providing the chamber of peers with a uniform he was very successful upon that question he stood badly with the liberal paper but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now getting him into favor with the journalists they talk of making him an ambassador 30303 â and what are his claims to the peerage â he has composed two or three comic operas written four or five articles in the siã cle and voted five or six year on the ministerial side â bravo viscount said count_of_monte_cristo smiling you are a delightful cicerone and now you will do me a favor will you not â what is it â do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen and should they wish it you will warn me just then the count felt his arm pressed he turned round it was mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars ah is it you baron said he why do you call me baron said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars you know that i care nothing for my title i am not like you viscount you like your title do you not â certainly replied monsieur_albert seeing that without my title i should be nothing while you sacrificing the baron would still remain the millionaire â which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of july replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars unfortunately said count_of_monte_cristo oneâ title to a millionaire does not last for life like that of baron peer of france or academician for example the millionaires franck poulmann of frankfurt who have just become bankrupts â indeed said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars becoming pale â_yes i received the news this evening by a courier
i had about a million in their hand but warned in time i withdrew it a month ago â ah mon dieu exclaimed mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars they have drawn on me for 200 000 franc â well you can throw out the draft their signature is worth five per cent â_yes but it is too late said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i have honored their bills â then said count_of_monte_cristo here are 200 000 franc gone afterâ â hush do not mention these thing said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars then approaching count_of_monte_cristo he added especially before young m_andrea_cavalcanti after which he smiled and turned towards the young man in question monsieur_albert had left the count to speak to his mother mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars to converse with young m_andrea_cavalcanti count_of_monte_cristo was for an instant alone meanwhile the heat became excessive the footmen were hastening through the room with waiters loaded with ices count_of_monte_cristo wiped the perspiration from his forehead but drew back when the waiter was presented to him he took no refreshment madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf did not lose sight of count_of_monte_cristo she saw that he took nothing and even noticed his gesture of refusal monsieur_albert she asked did you notice that â what mother â that the count has never been willing to partake of food under the roof of de viscount_albert_de_morcerf â_yes but then he breakfasted with meâ indeed he made his first appearance in the world on that occasion â but your house_of_peers is not de morcerfâ â murmured mercã_dã_s and since he has been here i have watched him â well â well he has taken nothing yet â the count is very temperate mercã_dã_s smiled sadly approach him said she and when the next waiter passes insist upon his taking something â but why mother â just to please me monsieur_albert said mercã_dã_s monsieur_albert kissed his motherâ hand and drew near the count
another salver passed loaded like the preceding one she saw monsieur_albert attempt to persuade the count but he obstinately refused monsieur_albert rejoined his mother she was very pale well said she you see he refuses â_yes but why need this annoy you â you know monsieur_albert woman are singular creatures i should like to have seen the count take something in my house_of_peers if only an ice perhaps he cannot reconcile himself to the french style of living and might prefer something else â_oh no i have seen him eat of everything in italy no doubt he does not feel inclined this evening â and besides said the countess accustomed as he is to burning climates possibly he does not feel the heat as we do â i do not think that for he has complained of feeling almost suffocated and asked why the venetian blinds were not opened as well as the window â in a word said mercã_dã_s â_it was a way of assuring me that his abstinence was intended and she left the room a minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns and the supper laid under the tent dancers players talkers all uttered an exclamation of joyâ everyone inhaled with delight the breeze that floated in at the same time mercã_dã_s reappeared paler than before but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which she sometimes wore she went straight to the group of which her husband formed the centre
â do not detain those gentlemen here count she said they would prefer i should think to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here since they are not playing â ah said a gallant old general who in 1809 had sung partant pour la syrie â we will not go alone to the garden â then said mercã_dã_s i will lead the way turning towards count_of_monte_cristo she added count will you oblige me with your arm the count almost staggered at these simple word then he fixed his eye on mercã_dã_s it was only a momentary glance but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century so much was expressed in that one look he offered his arm to the countess she took it or rather just touched it with her little hand and they together descended the step lined with rhododendrons and camellias behind them by another outlet a group of about twenty person rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of delight chapter 71 bread and salt madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf entered an archway of trees with her companion it led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory â_it was too warm in the room was it not count she asked â_yes madame and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the door and the blinds as he ceased speaking the count felt the hand of mercã_dã_s tremble but you he said with that light dress and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf perhaps you feel cold â do you know where i am leading you said the countess without replying to the question no madame replied count_of_monte_cristo but you see i make no resistance â we are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the grove
the count looked at mercã_dã_s as if to interrogate her but she continued to walk on in silence and he refrained from speaking they reached the building ornamented with magnificent fruits which ripen at the beginning of july in the artificial temperature which takes the place of the sun so frequently absent in our climate the countess left the arm of count_of_monte_cristo and gathered a bunch of muscatel grapes see count she said with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelidsâ see our french grapes are not to be compared i know with yours of sicily and cyprus but you will make allowance for our northern sun the count bowed but stepped back do you refuse said mercã_dã_s in a tremulous voice pray excuse me madame replied count_of_monte_cristo but i never eat muscatel grapes mercã_dã_s let them fall and sighed a magnificent peach was hanging against an adjoining wall ripened by the same artificial heat mercã_dã_s drew near and plucked the fruit take this peach then she said the count again refused what again she exclaimed in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob really you pain me a long silence followed the peach like the grapes fell to the ground count added mercã_dã_s with a supplicating glance
there is a beautiful arabian custom which makes eternal friend of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof â i know it madame replied the count but we are in france and not in arabia and in france eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another â but said the countess breathlessly with her eye fixed on count_of_monte_cristo whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hand we are friend are we not the count became pale as death the blood rushed to his heart and then again rising dyed his cheeks with crimson his eye swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled certainly we are friend he replied why should we not be the answer was so little like the one mercã_dã_s desired that she turned away to give vent to a sigh which sounded more like a groan thank you she said and they walked on again they went the whole length of the garden without uttering a word sir suddenly exclaimed the countess after their walk had continued ten minute in silence is it true that you have seen so much travelled so far and suffered so deeply â i have suffered deeply madame answered count_of_monte_cristo but now you are happy â doubtless replied the count since no one hears me complain â and your present happiness has it softened your heart â my present happiness equals my past misery said the count are you not married asked the countess i married exclaimed count_of_monte_cristo shuddering who could have told you so â no one told me you were but you have frequently been seen at the opera with a young and lovely woman
â she is a slave whom i bought at constantinople madame the daughter of a prince i have adopted her as my daughter having no one else to love in the world â you live alone then â i do â you have no sisterâ no sonâ no father â i have no one â how can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life â_it is not my fault madame at malta i loved a young girl was on the point of marrying her when war came and carried me away i thought she loved me well enough to wait for me and even to remain faithful to my memory when i returned she was married this is the history of most man who have passed twenty year of age perhaps my heart was weaker than the heart of most man and i suffered more than they would have done in my place that is all the countess stopped for a moment as if gasping for breath â_yes she said and you have still preserved this love in your heartâ one can only love onceâ and did you ever see her again 30309m never â never â i never returned to the country where she lived â to malta â_yes malta â she is then now at malta â i think so â and have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer â her â_yes â but only her do you then still hate those who separated you â i hate them not at all why should i the countess placed herself before count_of_monte_cristo still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed grapes take some she said madame i never eat muscatel grapes replied count_of_monte_cristo as if the subject had not been mentioned before the countess dashed the grapes into the nearest thicket with a gesture of despair inflexible
man she murmured count_of_monte_cristo remained as unmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to him monsieur_albert at this moment ran in â_oh mother he exclaimed such a misfortune has happened â what what has happened asked the countess as though awakening from a sleep to the realities of life did you say a misfortune indeed i should expect misfortunes â m_noirtier_de_villefort is here â well â he comes to fetch his wife and daughter â why so â because madame_de_saint_mã_ran is just arrived in paris bringing the news of de saint mã ranâ death which took place on the first stage after he left marseilles madame m_noirtier_de_villefort who was in very good spirits would neither believe nor think of the misfortune but mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort at the first word guessed the whole truth notwithstanding all the precautions of her father the blow struck her like a thunderbolt and she fell senseless â and how was de madame_de_saint_mã_ran related to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort said the count he was her grandfather on the motherâ side he was coming here to hasten her marriage with m_franz_de_quesnel â ah indeed â so m_franz_de_quesnel must wait why was not de madame_de_saint_mã_ran also grandfather to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â monsieur_albert albert said madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf in a tone of mild reproof what are you saying ah count he esteems you so highly tell him that he has spoken amiss and she took two or three step forward count_of_monte_cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful and so full of affectionate admiration that she turned back and grasped his hand at the same time she seized that of her son and joined them together we are friend are we not she asked
â oh madame i do not presume to call myself your friend but at all time i am your most respectful servant the countess left with an indescribable pang in her heart and before she had taken ten step the count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eye do not my mother and you agree asked monsieur_albert astonished on the contrary replied the count did you not hear her declare that we were friend they re entered the drawing room which mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and madame m_noirtier_de_villefort had just quitted it is perhaps needless to add that m_maximilian_morrel departed almost at the same time chapter 72 madame_de_saint_mã_ran a gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house_of_peers of m_noirtier_de_villefort after the ladies had departed for the ball whither all the entreaties of madame m_noirtier_de_villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them the procureur had shut himself up in his study according to his custom with a heap of paper calculated to alarm anyone else but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires but this time the paper were a mere matter of form m_noirtier_de_villefort had secluded himself not to study but to reflect and with the door locked and order given that he should not be disturbed excepting for important business he sat down in his armchair and began to ponder over the events the remembrance of which had during the last eight day filled his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter recollections
then instead of plunging into the mass of documents piled before him he opened the drawer of his desk touched a spring and drew out a parcel of cherished memoranda amongst which he had carefully arranged in characters only known to himself the name of all those who either in his political career in money matters at the bar or in his mysterious love affairs had become his enemies their number was formidable now that he had begun to fear and yet these name powerful though they were had often caused him to smile with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from the summit of a mountain beholds at his foot the craggy eminences the almost impassable paths and the fearful chasms through which he has so perilously climbed when he had run over all these name in his memory again read and studied them commenting meanwhile upon his lists he shook his head no he murmured none of my enemies would have waited so patiently and laboriously for so long a space of time that they might now come and crush me with this secret sometimes as hamlet says foul deeds will rise though all the earth oâ erwhelm them to menâ eye but like a phosphoric light they rise but to mislead the story has been told by the corsican to some priest who in his turn has repeated it
m de count_of_monte_cristo may have heard it and to enlighten himselfâ â but why should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject asked m_noirtier_de_villefort after a momentâ reflection what interest can this de count_of_monte_cristo or zaccone son of a shipowner of malta discoverer of a mine in thessaly now visiting paris for the first time what interest i say can he take in discovering a gloomy mysterious and useless fact like this however among all the incoherent details given to me by the abbã_busoni and by lord_wilmore by that friend and that enemy one thing appears certain and clear in my opinionâ that in no period in no case in no circumstance could there have been any contact between him and me but m_noirtier_de_villefort uttered word which even he himself did not believe he dreaded not so much the revelation for he could reply to or deny its truth he cared little for that mene mene tekel upharsin which appeared suddenly in letter of blood upon the wall but what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them while he was endeavoring to calm his fears and instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious dreams was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home in fear of awakening the enemy that had so long slept the noise of a carriage sounded in the yard then he heard the step of an aged person ascending the stairs followed by tears and lamentations such as servant always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in their masterâ grief
he drew back the bolt of his door and almost directly an old lady entered unannounced carrying her shawl on her arm and her bonnet in her hand the white hair was thrown back from her yellow forehead and her eye already sunken by the furrows of age now almost disappeared beneath the eyelids swollen with grief â_oh sir she said â_oh sir what a misfortune i shall die of it oh yes i shall certainly die of it and then falling upon the chair nearest the door she burst into a paroxysm of sobs the servant standing in the doorway not daring to approach nearer were looking at noirtierâ old servant who had heard the noise from his masterâ room and run there also remaining behind the others m_noirtier_de_villefort rose and ran towards his mother in law for it was she why what can have happened he exclaimed what has thus disturbed you is de madame_de_saint_mã_ran with you â de madame_de_saint_mã_ran is dead answered the old marchioness without preface and without expression she appeared to be stupefied m_noirtier_de_villefort drew back and clasping his hand together exclaimed dead so suddenly â a week ago continued madame_de_saint_mã_ran we went out together in the carriage after dinner de madame_de_saint_mã_ran had been unwell for some day still the idea of seeing our dear mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort again inspired him with courage and notwithstanding his illness he would leave at six leagues from marseilles after having eaten some of the lozenges he is accustomed to take he fell into such a deep sleep that it appeared to me unnatural still i hesitated to wake him although i fancied that his face was flushed and that the veins of his temples throbbed more violently than usual
however as it became dark and i could no longer see i fell asleep i was soon aroused by a piercing shriek as from a person suffering in his dreams and he suddenly threw his head back violently i called the valet i stopped the postilion i spoke to de madame_de_saint_mã_ran i applied my smelling salts but all was over and i arrived at aix by the side of a corpse m_noirtier_de_villefort stood with his mouth half open quite stupefied of course you sent for a doctor â immediately but as i have told you it was too late â_yes but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had died â_oh yes sir he told me it appears to have been an apoplectic stroke â and what did you do then â de madame_de_saint_mã_ran had always expressed a desire in case his death happened during his absence from paris that his body might be brought to the family vault i had him put into a leaden coffin and i am preceding him by a few day â_oh my poor mother said m_noirtier_de_villefort to have such duties to perform at your age after such a blow â god has supported me through all and then my dear marquis he would certainly have done everything for me that i performed for him it is true that since i left him i seem to have lost my senses i cannot cry at my age they say that we have no more tears still i think that when one is in trouble one should have the power of weeping where is mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort sir it is on her account i am here i wish to see mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort
30315m m_noirtier_de_villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort was at a ball so he only said that she had gone out with her step mother and that she should be fetched this instant sirâ this instant i beseech you said the old lady m_noirtier_de_villefort placed the arm of madame_de_saint_mã_ran within his own and conducted her to his apartment rest yourself mother he said the marchioness raised her head at this word and beholding the man who so forcibly reminded her of her deeply regretted child who still lived for her in mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort she felt touched at the name of mother and bursting into tears she fell on her knees before an armchair where she buried her venerable head m_noirtier_de_villefort left her to the care of the woman while old barrois ran half scared to his master for nothing frightens old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over them for a moment in order to strike some other old person then while madame_de_saint_mã_ran remained on her knees praying fervently m_noirtier_de_villefort sent for a cab and went himself to fetch his wife and daughter from madame de morcerfâ he was so pale when he appeared at the door of the ball room that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort ran to him saying â_oh father some misfortune has happened â your grandmamma has just arrived mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said m_noirtier_de_villefort and grandpapa inquired the young girl trembling with apprehension m_noirtier_de_villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter it was just in time for valentineâ head swam and she staggered madame m_noirtier_de_villefort instantly hastened to her assistance and aided her husband in dragging her to the carriage saying what a singular event who could have thought it ah yes it is indeed strange
and the wretched family departed leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of the evening at the foot of the stairs mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort found barrois awaiting her m_noirtier_de_villefort wishes to see you tonight he said in an undertone tell him i will come when i leave my dear grandmamma she replied feeling with true delicacy that the person to whom she could be of the most service just then was madame_de_saint_mã_ran mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort found her grandmother in bed silent caresses heartwrung sobs broken sighs burning tears were all that passed in this sad interview while madame m_noirtier_de_villefort leaning on her husbandâ arm maintained all outward forms of respect at least towards the poor widow she soon whispered to her husband i think it would be better for me to retire with your permission for the sight of me appears still to afflict your mother in law madame_de_saint_mã_ran heard her â_yes yes she said softly to mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort let her leave but do you stay madame m_noirtier_de_villefort left and mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort remained alone beside the bed for the procureur overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death had followed his wife meanwhile barrois had returned for the first time to old m_noirtier_de_villefort who having heard the noise in the house_of_peers had as we have said sent his old servant to inquire the cause on his return his quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger alas sir exclaimed barrois a great misfortune has happened madame_de_saint_mã_ran has arrived and her husband is dead m de madame_de_saint_mã_ran and m_noirtier_de_villefort had never been on strict terms of friendship still the death of one old man always considerably affects another m_noirtier_de_villefort let his head fall upon his chest apparently overwhelmed and thoughtful then he closed one eye in token of inquiry
barrois asked mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort m_noirtier_de_villefort nodded his head she is at the ball as you know since she came to say good bye to you in full dress m_noirtier_de_villefort again closed his left eye do you wish to see her m_noirtier_de_villefort again made an affirmative sign well they have gone to fetch her no doubt from madame de morcerfâ i will await her return and beg her to come up here is that what you wish for â_yes replied the invalid barrois therefore as we have seen watched for mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and informed her of her grandfatherâ wish consequently mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort came up to m_noirtier_de_villefort on leaving madame_de_saint_mã_ran who in the midst of her grief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a bottle of orangeade her usual beverage and a glass then as we have said the young girl left the bedside to see m_noirtier_de_villefort mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort kissed the old man who looked at her with such tenderness that her eye again filled with tears whose sources he thought must be exhausted the old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression â_yes yes said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort you mean that i have yet a kind grandfather left do you not the old man intimated that such was his meaning ah yes happily i have replied mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort without that what would become of me â_it was one oâ clock in the morning barrois who wished to go to bed himself observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of rest m_noirtier_de_villefort would not say that the only rest he needed was to see his child but wished her good night for grief and fatigue had made her appear quite ill
the next morning she found her grandmother in bed the fever had not abated on the contrary her eye glistened and she appeared to be suffering from violent nervous irritability â_oh dear grandmamma are you worse exclaimed mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort perceiving all these signs of agitation no my child no said madame_de_saint_mã_ran but i was impatiently waiting for your arrival that i might send for your father â my father inquired mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort uneasily â_yes i wish to speak to him mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort durst not oppose her grandmotherâ wish the cause of which she did not know and an instant afterwards m_noirtier_de_villefort entered sir said madame_de_saint_mã_ran without using any circumlocution and as if fearing she had no time to lose you wrote to me concerning the marriage of this child â_yes madame replied m_noirtier_de_villefort â_it is not only projected but arranged â your intended son in law is named m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay â_yes madame â is he not the son of general dâ pinay who was on our side and who was assassinated some day before the usurper returned from the island of elba â the same â does he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a jacobin â our civil dissensions are now happily extinguished mother said m_noirtier_de_villefort m dâ pinay was quite a child when his father died he knows very little of m_noirtier_de_villefort and will meet him if not with pleasure at least with indifference â is it a suitable match â in every respect â and the young man â is regarded with universal esteem â you approve of him â he is one of the most well bred young man i know during the whole of this conversation mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort had remained silent
â well sir said madame_de_saint_mã_ran after a few minutesâ reflection i must hasten the marriage for i have but a short time to live â you madame â you dear mamma exclaimed m_noirtier_de_villefort and mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort at the same time i know what i am saying continued the marchioness i must hurry you so that as she has no mother she may at least have a grandmother to bless her marriage i am all that is left to her belonging to my poor renã_e whom you have so soon forgotten sir â ah madame said m_noirtier_de_villefort you forget that i was obliged to give a mother to my child â a stepmother is never a mother sir but this is not to the purpose our business concerns mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort let us leave the dead in peace all this was said with such exceeding rapidity that there was something in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of delirium â_it shall be as you wish madame said m_noirtier_de_villefort more especially since your wishes coincide with mine and as soon as dâ pinay arrives in parisâ â 30319m my dear grandmother interrupted mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort consider decorumâ the recent death you would not have me marry under such sad auspices â my child exclaimed the old lady sharply let us hear none of the conventional objections that deter weak mind from preparing for the future i also was married at the death bed of my mother and certainly i have not been less happy on that account â still that idea of death madame said m_noirtier_de_villefort still always i tell you i am going to dieâ do you understand well before dying i wish to see my son in law
i wish to tell him to make my child happy i wish to read in his eye whether he intends to obey me in fact i will know himâ i will continued the old lady with a fearful expression that i may rise from the depths of my grave to find him if he should not fulfil his duty â madame said m_noirtier_de_villefort you must lay aside these exalted idea which almost assume the appearance of madness the dead once buried in their graves rise no more â and i tell you sir that you are mistaken this night i have had a fearful sleep it seemed as though my soul were already hovering over my body my eye which i tried to open closed against my will and what will appear impossible above all to you sir i saw with my eye shut in the spot where you are now standing issuing from that corner where there is a door leading into madame villefortâ dressing roomâ i saw i tell you silently enter a white figure mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort screamed â_it was the fever that disturbed you madame said m_noirtier_de_villefort 30321m doubt if you please but i am sure of what i say i saw a white figure and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only one of my senses i heard my glass removedâ the same which is there now on the table â_oh dear mother it was a dream â so little was it a dream that i stretched my hand towards the bell but when i did so the shade disappeared my maid then entered with a light â but she saw no one â phantoms are visible to those only who ought to see them
it was the soul of my husband well if my husbandâ soul can come to me why should not my soul reappear to guard my granddaughter the tie is even more direct it seems to me â_oh madame said m_noirtier_de_villefort deeply affected in spite of himself do not yield to those gloomy thoughts you will long live with us happy loved and honored and we will make you forgetâ â never never never said the marchioness when does dâ pinay return â we expect him every moment â_it is well as soon as he arrives inform me we must be expeditious and then i also wish to see a notary that i may be assured that all our property returns to mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â ah grandmamma murmured mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort pressing her lip on the burning brow do you wish to kill me oh how feverish you are we must not send for a notary but for a doctor â a doctor said she shrugging her shoulders i am not ill i am thirstyâ that is all 30323m what are you drinking dear grandmamma â the same as usual my dear my glass is there on the tableâ give it to me mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort poured the orangeade into a glass and gave it to her grandmother with a certain degree of dread for it was the same glass she fancied that had been touched by the spectre the marchioness drained the glass at a single draught and then turned on her pillow repeating the notary the notary m_noirtier_de_villefort left the room and mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort seated herself at the bedside of her grandmother the poor child appeared herself to require the doctor she had recommended to her aged relative a bright spot burned in either cheek her respiration was short and difficult and her pulse beat with feverish excitement
she was thinking of the despair of m_maximilian_morrel when he should be informed that madame_de_saint_mã_ran instead of being an ally was unconsciously acting as his enemy more than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother and she would not have hesitated a moment if m_maximilian_morrel had been named monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf or raoul de baron_de_chã_teau_renaud but m_maximilian_morrel was of plebeian extraction and mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort knew how the haughty marquise de madame_de_saint_mã_ran despised all who were not noble her secret had each time been repressed when she was about to reveal it by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so for were it once discovered by her father and mother all would be lost two hour passed thus madame_de_saint_mã_ran was in a feverish sleep and the notary had arrived though his coming was announced in a very low tone madame_de_saint_mã_ran arose from her pillow the notary she exclaimed let him come in the notary who was at the door immediately entered go mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said madame_de_saint_mã_ran and leave me with this gentleman â but grandmammaâ â leave meâ go the young girl kissed her grandmother and left with her handkerchief to her eye at the door she found the valet de chambre who told her that the doctor was waiting in the dining room mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort instantly ran down the doctor was a friend of the family and at the same time one of the cleverest man of the day and very fond of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort whose birth he had witnessed he had himself a daughter about her age but whose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to him from her mother having been consumptive â_oh said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort we have been waiting for you with such impatience dear dâ avrigny
but first of all how are madeleine and antoinette madeleine was the daughter of dâ avrigny and antoinette his niece dâ avrigny smiled sadly antoinette is very well he said and madeleine tolerably so but you sent for me my dear child it is not your father or madame m_noirtier_de_villefort who is ill as for you although we doctors cannot divest our patients of nerves i fancy you have no further need of me than to recommend you not to allow your imagination to take too wide a field mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort colored dâ avrigny carried the science of divination almost to a miraculous extent for he was one of the physicians who always work upon the body through the mind 30325m no she replied â_it is for my poor grandmother you know the calamity that has happened to us do you not â i know nothing said dâ avrigny alas said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort restraining her tears my grandfather is dead â de madame_de_saint_mã_ran â_yes â suddenly â from an apoplectic stroke â an apoplectic stroke repeated the doctor â_yes and my poor grandmother fancies that her husband whom she never left has called her and that she must go and join him oh dâ avrigny i beseech you do something for her â where is she â in her room with the notary â and m_noirtier_de_villefort â just as he was his mind perfectly clear but the same incapability of moving or speaking â and the same love for youâ eh my dear child â_yes said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort he was very fond of me â who does not love you mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort smiled sadly what are your grandmotherâ symptoms â an extreme nervous excitement and a strangely agitated sleep she fancied this morning in her sleep that her soul was hovering above her body which she at the same time watched
it must have been delirium she fancies too that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even heard the noise it made on touching her glass â_it is singular said the doctor i was not aware that madame_de_saint_mã_ran was subject to such hallucinations â_it is the first time i ever saw her in this condition said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and this morning she frightened me so that i thought her mad and my father who you know is a strong minded man himself appeared deeply impressed â we will go and see said the doctor what you tell me seems very strange the notary here descended and mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort was informed that her grandmother was alone go upstairs she said to the doctor and you â_oh i dare notâ she forbade my sending for you and as you say i am myself agitated feverish and out of sorts i will go and take a turn in the garden to recover myself the doctor pressed valentineâ hand and while he visited her grandmother she descended the step we need not say which portion of the garden was her favorite walk after remaining for a short time in the parterre surrounding the house_of_peers and gathering a rose to place in her waist or hair she turned into the dark avenue which led to the bench then from the bench she went to the gate as usual mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort strolled for a short time among her flowers but without gathering them the mourning in her heart forbade her assuming this simple ornament though she had not yet had time to put on the outward semblance of woe 30327 she then turned towards the avenue as she advanced she fancied she heard a voice speaking her name
she stopped astonished then the voice reached her ear more distinctly and she recognized it to be that of m_maximilian_morrel chapter 73 the promise it was indeed m_maximilian_morrel who had passed a wretched existence since the previous day with the instinct peculiar to lovers he had anticipated after the return of madame_de_saint_mã_ran and the death of the marquis that something would occur at de villefortâ in connection with his attachment for mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort his presentiments were realized as we shall see and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him pale and trembling to the gate under the chestnut trees mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety and as it was not his accustomed hour for visiting her she had gone to the spot simply by accident or perhaps through sympathy m_maximilian_morrel called her and she ran to the gate you here at this hour said she â_yes my poor girl replied m_maximilian_morrel i come to bring and to hear bad tidings â this is indeed a house_of_peers of mourning said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort speak m_maximilian_morrel although the cup of sorrow seems already full â dear mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said m_maximilian_morrel endeavoring to conceal his own emotion listen i entreat you what i am about to say is very serious when are you to be married â i will tell you all said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort from you i have nothing to conceal this morning the subject was introduced and my dear grandmother on whom i depended as my only support not only declared herself favorable to it but is so anxious for it that they only await the arrival of dâ pinay and the following day the contract will be signed a deep sigh escaped the young man who gazed long and mournfully at her he loved
â alas replied he â_it is dreadful thus to hear my condemnation from your own lip the sentence is passed and in a few hour will be executed it must be so and i will not endeavor to prevent it but since you say nothing remains but for dâ pinay to arrive that the contract may be signed and the following day you will be his tomorrow you will be engaged to dâ pinay for he came this morning to paris mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort uttered a cry i was at the house_of_peers of count_of_monte_cristo an hour since said m_maximilian_morrel we were speaking he of the sorrow your family had experienced and i of your grief when a carriage rolled into the courtyard never till then had i placed any confidence in presentiments but now i cannot help believing them mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort at the sound of that carriage i shuddered soon i heard step on the staircase which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did don juan the door at last opened monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf entered first and i began to hope my fears were vain when after him another young man advanced and the count exclaimed ah here is the baron m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay i summoned all my strength and courage to my support perhaps i turned pale and trembled but certainly i smiled and five minute after i left without having heard one word that had passed â poor m_maximilian_morrel murmured mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort the time has arrived when you must answer me and remember my life depends on your answer what do you intend doing mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort held down her head she was overwhelmed

tell me how can i do otherwise â do not appeal to me mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i shall be a bad judge in such a case my selfishness will blind me replied m_maximilian_morrel whose low voice and clenched hand announced his growing desperation what would you have proposed m_maximilian_morrel had you found me willing to accede â_it is not for me to say â you are wrong you must advise me what to do â do you seriously ask my advice mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â certainly dear m_maximilian_morrel for if it is good i will follow it you know my devotion to you â mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said m_maximilian_morrel pushing aside a loose plank give me your hand in token of forgiveness of my anger my senses are confused and during the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through my brain oh if you refuse my adviceâ â what do you advise said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort raising her eye to heaven and sighing i am free replied m_maximilian_morrel and rich enough to support you i swear to make you my lawful wife before my lip even shall have approached your forehead â you make me tremble said the young girl follow me said m_maximilian_morrel i will take you to my sister who is worthy also to be yours we will embark for algiers for england for america or if you prefer it retire to the country and only return to paris when our friend have reconciled your family mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort shook her head i feared it m_maximilian_morrel said she â_it is the counsel of a madman and i should be more mad than you did i not stop you at once with the word impossible m_maximilian_morrel impossible â you will then submit to what fate decrees for you without even attempting to contend with it said m_maximilian_morrel sorrowfully â_yes
â if i die â well mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort resumed m_maximilian_morrel i can only say again that you are right truly it is i who am mad and you prove to me that passion blinds the most well meaning i appreciate your calm reasoning it is then understood that tomorrow you will be irrevocably promised to m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay not only by that theatrical formality invented to heighten the effect of a comedy called the signature of the contract but your own will â again you drive me to despair m_maximilian_morrel said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort again you plunge the dagger into the wound what would you do tell me if your sister listened to such a proposition â mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars replied m_maximilian_morrel with a bitter smile i am selfishâ you have already said soâ and as a selfish man i think not of what others would do in my situation but of what i intend doing myself i think only that i have known you not a whole year from the day i first saw you all my hopes of happiness have been in securing your affection one day you acknowledged that you loved me and since that day my hope of future happiness has rested on obtaining you for to gain you would be life to me now i think no more i say only that fortune has turned against meâ i had thought to gain heaven and now i have lost it it is an every day occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he possesses but also what he has not m_maximilian_morrel pronounced these word with perfect calmness mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort looked at him a moment with her large scrutinizing eye endeavoring not to let m_maximilian_morrel discover the grief which struggled in her heart but in a word what are you going to do asked she
â i am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars solemnly assuring you that i wish your life may be so calm so happy and so fully occupied that there may be no place for me even in your memory â_oh murmured mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort adieu mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort adieu said m_maximilian_morrel bowing where are you going cried the young girl extending her hand through the opening and seizing m_maximilian_morrel by his coat for she understood from her own agitated feelings that her loverâ calmness could not be real where are you going â i am going that i may not bring fresh trouble into your family and to set an example which every honest and devoted man situated as i am may follow â before you leave me tell me what you are going to do m_maximilian_morrel the young man smiled sorrowfully speak speak said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort i entreat you â has your resolution changed mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â_it cannot change unhappy man you know it must not cried the young girl then adieu mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort shook the gate with a strength of which she could not have been supposed to be possessed as m_maximilian_morrel was going away and passing both her hand through the opening she clasped and wrung them i must know what you mean to do said she where are you going â_oh fear not said m_maximilian_morrel stopping at a short distance i do not intend to render another man responsible for the rigorous fate reserved for me another might threaten to seek m_franz_de_quesnel to provoke him and to fight with him all that would be folly what has m_franz_de_quesnel to do with it he saw me this morning for the first time and has already forgotten he has seen me
he did not even know i existed when it was arranged by your two families that you should be united i have no enmity against m_franz_de_quesnel and promise you the punishment shall not fall on him â on whom then on me â on you mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort oh heaven forbid woman is sacred the woman one loves is holy â on yourself then unhappy man on yourself â i am the only guilty person am i not said m_maximilian_morrel m_maximilian_morrel said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort m_maximilian_morrel come back i entreat you he drew near with his sweet smile and but for his paleness one might have thought him in his usual happy mood listen my dear my adored mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said he in his melodious and grave tone those who like us have never had a thought for which we need blush before the world such may read each otherâ heart i never was romantic and am no melancholy hero i imitate neither manfred nor anthony but without word protestations or vows my life has entwined itself with yours you leave me and you are right in doing so i repeat it you are right but in losing you i lose my life the moment you leave me mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort i am alone in the world my sister is happily married her husband is only my brother in law that is a man whom the ties of social life alone attach to me no one then longer needs my useless life
this is what i shall do i will wait until the very moment you are married for i will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us since m_franz_de_quesnel may after all die before that time a thunderbolt may fall even on the altar as you approach it nothing appears impossible to one condemned to die and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is concerned i will then wait until the last moment and when my misery is certain irremediable hopeless i will write a confidential letter to my brother in law another to the prefect of police to acquaint them with my intention and at the corner of some wood on the brink of some abyss on the bank of some river i will put an end to my existence as certainly as i am the son of the most honest man who ever lived in france 30333m mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort trembled convulsively she loosened her hold of the gate her arm fell by her side and two large tears rolled down her cheeks the young man stood before her sorrowful and resolute â_oh for pityâ sake said she you will live will you not â no on my honor said m_maximilian_morrel but that will not affect you you have done your duty and your conscience will be at rest mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort fell on her knees and pressed her almost bursting heart m_maximilian_morrel said she m_maximilian_morrel my friend my brother on earth my true husband in heaven i entreat you do as i do live in suffering perhaps we may one day be united â adieu mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort repeated m_maximilian_morrel my god said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort raising both her hand to heaven with a sublime expression i have done my utmost to remain a submissive daughter
i have begged entreated implored he has regarded neither my prayers my entreaties nor my tears it is done cried she wiping away her tears and resuming her firmness i am resolved not to die of remorse but rather of shame live m_maximilian_morrel and i will be yours say when shall it be speak command i will obey m_maximilian_morrel who had already gone some few step away again returned and pale with joy extended both hand towards mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort through the opening mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said he dear mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort you must not speak thusâ rather let me die why should i obtain you by violence if our love is mutual is it from mere humanity you bid me live i would then rather die â truly murmured mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort who on this earth cares for me if he does not who has consoled me in my sorrow but he on whom do my hopes rest on whom does my bleeding heart repose on him on him always on him yes you are right m_maximilian_morrel i will follow you i will leave the paternal home i will give up all oh ungrateful girl that i am cried mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort sobbing i will give up all even my dear old grandfather whom i had nearly forgotten â no said m_maximilian_morrel you shall not leave him m_noirtier_de_villefort has evinced you say a kind feeling towards me well before you leave tell him all his consent would be your justification in godâ sight as soon as we are married he shall come and live with us instead of one child he shall have two
you have told me how you talk to him and how he answers you i shall very soon learn that language by signs mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and i promise you solemnly that instead of despair it is happiness that awaits us â_oh see m_maximilian_morrel see the power you have over me you almost make me believe you and yet what you tell me is madness for my father will curse meâ he is inflexibleâ he will never pardon me now listen to me m_maximilian_morrel if by artifice by entreaty by accidentâ in short if by any means i can delay this marriage will you wait â_yes i promise you as faithfully as you have promised me that this horrible marriage shall not take place and that if you are dragged before a magistrate or a priest you will refuse â i promise you by all that is most sacred to me in the world namely by my mother â we will wait then said m_maximilian_morrel â_yes we will wait replied mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort who revived at these word there are so many thing which may save unhappy beings such as we are â i rely on you mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said m_maximilian_morrel all you do will be well done only if they disregard your prayers if your father and madame_de_saint_mã_ran insist that dâ pinay should be called tomorrow to sign the contractâ â then you have my promise m_maximilian_morrel â instead of signingâ â i will go to you and we will fly but from this moment until then let us not tempt providence let us not see each other it is a miracle it is a providence that we have not been discovered
if we were surprised if it were known that we met thus we should have no further resource â you are right mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort but how shall i ascertain â from the notary deschamps â i know him â and for myselfâ i will write to you depend on me i dread this marriage m_maximilian_morrel as much as you â thank you my adored mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort thank you that is enough when once i know the hour i will hasten to this spot you can easily get over this fence with my assistance a carriage will await us at the gate in which you will accompany me to my sisterâ there living retired or mingling in society as you wish we shall be enabled to use our power to resist oppression and not suffer ourselves to be put to death like sheep which only defend themselves by sighs â_yes said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort i will now acknowledge you are right m_maximilian_morrel and now are you satisfied with your betrothal said the young girl sorrowfully my adored mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort word cannot express one half of my satisfaction mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort had approached or rather had placed her lip so near the fence that they nearly touched those of m_maximilian_morrel which were pressed against the other side of the cold and inexorable barrier adieu then till we meet again said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort tearing herself away i shall hear from you â_yes â thanks thanks dear love adieu the sound of a kiss was heard and mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort fled through the avenue m_maximilian_morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his eye with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also disappeared
the young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any message it was only on the following day at about ten oâ clock in the morning as he was starting to call on deschamps the notary that he received from the postman a small billet which he knew to be from mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort although he had not before seen her writing it was to this effect tears entreaties prayers have availed me nothing yesterday for two hour i was at the church of saint philippe du roule and for two hour i prayed most fervently heaven is as inflexible as man and the signature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine oâ clock i have but one promise and but one heart to give that promise is pledged to you that heart is also yours this evening then at a quarter to nine at the gate your betrothed mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort m_noirtier_de_villefort â s my poor grandmother gets worse and worse yesterday her fever amounted to delirium today her delirium is almost madness you will be very kind to me will you not m_maximilian_morrel to make me forget my sorrow in leaving her thus i think it is kept a secret from grandpapa m_noirtier_de_villefort that the contract is to be signed this evening m_maximilian_morrel went also to the notary who confirmed the news that the contract was to be signed that evening then he went to call on count_of_monte_cristo and heard still more
franz had been to announce the ceremony and madame m_noirtier_de_villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting him the death of de madame_de_saint_mã_ran and the dangerous illness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should be shared by the count whom she wished every happiness the day before m_franz_de_quesnel had been presented to madame_de_saint_mã_ran who had left her bed to receive him but had been obliged to return to it immediately after it is easy to suppose that morrelâ agitation would not escape the countâ penetrating eye count_of_monte_cristo was more affectionate than ever indeed his manner was so kind that several time m_maximilian_morrel was on the point of telling him all but he recalled the promise he had made to mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and kept his secret the young man read valentineâ letter twenty time in the course of the day it was her first and on what an occasion each time he read it he renewed his vow to make her happy how great is the power of a woman who has made so courageous a resolution what devotion does she deserve from him for whom she has sacrificed everything how ought she really to be supremely loved she becomes at once a queen and a wife and it is impossible to thank and love her sufficiently
morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort say here i am m_maximilian_morrel come and help me he had arranged everything for her escape two ladders were hidden in the clover field a cabriolet was ordered for m_maximilian_morrel alone without a servant without light at the turning of the first street they would light the lamps as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions occasionally he shuddered he thought of the moment when from the top of that wall he should protect the descent of his dear mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort pressing in his arm for the first time her of whom he had yet only kissed the delicate hand when the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near he wished for solitude his agitation was extreme a simple question from a friend would have irritated him he shut himself in his room and tried to read but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a word and he threw away the book and for the second time sat down to sketch his plan the ladders and the fence at length the hour drew near never did a man deeply in love allow the clocks to go on peacefully m_maximilian_morrel tormented his so effectually that they struck eight at half past six he then said â_it is time to start the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine oâ clock but perhaps mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort will not wait for that consequently m_maximilian_morrel having left the rue meslay at half past eight by his timepiece entered the clover field while the clock of saint philippe du roule was striking eight the horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin where m_maximilian_morrel had often waited
the night gradually drew on and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper hue then m_maximilian_morrel came out from his hiding place with a beating heart and looked through the small opening in the gate there was yet no one to be seen the clock struck half past eight and still another half hour was passed in waiting while m_maximilian_morrel walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the opening the garden became darker still but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress and in the silence he vainly listened for the sound of footsteps the house_of_peers which was discernible through the trees remained in darkness and gave no indication that so important an event as the signature of a marriage contract was going on m_maximilian_morrel looked at his watch which wanted a quarter to ten but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three time rectified the error by striking half past nine this was already half an hour past the time mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort had fixed it was a terrible moment for the young man the slightest rustling of the foliage the least whistling of the wind attracted his attention and drew the perspiration to his brow then he tremblingly fixed his ladder and not to lose a moment placed his foot on the first step amidst all these alternations of hope and fear the clock struck ten â_it is impossible said m_maximilian_morrel that the signing of a contract should occupy so long a time without unexpected interruptions i have weighed all the chances calculated the time required for all the forms something must have happened and then he walked rapidly to and fro and pressed his burning forehead against the fence had mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort fainted
or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight these were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young man the idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape and that she had fainted in one of the paths was the one that most impressed itself upon his mind in that case said he i should lose her and by my own fault he dwelt on this idea for a moment then it appeared reality he even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance he ventured to call and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh at last the half hour struck it was impossible to wait longer his temples throbbed violently his eye were growing dim he passed one leg over the wall and in a moment leaped down on the other side he was on villefortâ premisesâ had arrived there by scaling the wall what might be the consequences however he had not ventured thus far to draw back he followed a short distance close under the wall then crossed a path hid entered a clump of trees in a moment he had passed through them and could see the house_of_peers distinctly 30341m then m_maximilian_morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house_of_peers was not illuminated instead of light at every window as is customary on day of ceremony he saw only a gray mass which was veiled also by a cloud which at that moment obscured the moonâ feeble light a light moved rapidly from time to time past three window of the second floor these three window were in madame de saint mã ranâ room another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in madame de villefortâ bedroom
morrel guessed all this so many time in order to follow mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort in thought at every hour in the day had he made her describe the whole house_of_peers that without having seen it he knew it all this darkness and silence alarmed m_maximilian_morrel still more than valentineâ absence had done almost mad with grief and determined to venture everything in order to see mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort once more and be certain of the misfortune he feared m_maximilian_morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower garden when the sound of a voice still at some distance but which was borne upon the wind reached him at this sound as he was already partially exposed to view he stepped back and concealed himself completely remaining perfectly motionless he had formed his resolution if it was mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort alone he would speak as she passed if she was accompanied and he could not speak still he should see her and know that she was safe if they were strangers he would listen to their conversation and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible mystery the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and m_maximilian_morrel saw m_noirtier_de_villefort come out upon the step followed by a gentleman in black they descended and advanced towards the clump of trees and m_maximilian_morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as doctor dâ avrigny 30339 the young man seeing them approach drew back mechanically until he found himself stopped by a sycamore tree in the centre of the clump there he was compelled to remain soon the two gentlemen stopped also ah my dear doctor said the procureur heaven declares itself against my house_of_peers what a dreadful deathâ what a blow
seek not to console me alas nothing can alleviate so great a sorrowâ the wound is too deep and too fresh dead dead the cold sweat sprang to the young manâ brow and his teeth chattered who could be dead in that house_of_peers which m_noirtier_de_villefort himself had called accursed my dear m_noirtier_de_villefort replied the doctor with a tone which redoubled the terror of the young man i have not led you here to console you on the contraryâ â what can you mean asked the procureur alarmed i mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you there is another perhaps still greater â can it be possible murmured m_noirtier_de_villefort clasping his hand what are you going to tell me â are we quite alone my friend â_yes quite but why all these precautions â because i have a terrible secret to communicate to you said the doctor let us sit down m_noirtier_de_villefort fell rather than seated himself the doctor stood before him with one hand placed on his shoulder m_maximilian_morrel horrified supported his head with one hand and with the other pressed his heart lest its beatings should be heard dead dead repeated he within himself and he felt as if he were also dying speak doctorâ i am listening said m_noirtier_de_villefort strikeâ i am prepared for everything â madame_de_saint_mã_ran was doubtless advancing in year but she enjoyed excellent health m_maximilian_morrel began again to breathe freely which he had not done during the last ten minute grief has consumed her said villefortâ â_yes grief doctor after living forty year with the marquisâ â â_it is not grief my dear m_noirtier_de_villefort said the doctor grief may kill although it rarely does and never in a day never in an hour never in
ten minute m_noirtier_de_villefort answered nothing he simply raised his head which had been cast down before and looked at the doctor with amazement were you present during the last struggle asked dâ avrigny i was replied the procureur you begged me not to leave â did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which madame_de_saint_mã_ran has fallen a victim â i did madame_de_saint_mã_ran had three successive attacks at intervals of some minute each one more serious than the former when you arrived madame_de_saint_mã_ran had already been panting for breath some minute she then had a fit which i took to be simply a nervous attack and it was only when i saw her raise herself in the bed and her limbs and neck appear stiffened that i became really alarmed then i understood from your countenance there was more to fear than i had thought this crisis past i endeavored to catch your eye but could not you held her handâ you were feeling her pulseâ and the second fit came on before you had turned towards me this was more terrible than the first the same nervous movements were repeated and the mouth contracted and turned purple â and at the third she expired â at the end of the first attack i discovered symptoms of tetanus you confirmed my opinion â_yes before others replied the doctor but now we are aloneâ â what are you going to say oh spare me â that the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are the same m_noirtier_de_villefort started from his seat then in a moment fell down again silent and motionless
morrel knew not if he were dreaming or awake listen said the doctor i know the full importance of the statement i have just made and the disposition of the man to whom i have made it â do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend asked m_noirtier_de_villefort as a friend and only as a friend at this moment the similarity in the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so great that were i obliged to affirm by oath what i have now stated i should hesitate i therefore repeat to you i speak not to a magistrate but to a friend and to that friend i say during the three quarters of an hour that the struggle continued i watched the convulsions and the death of madame_de_saint_mã_ran and am thoroughly convinced that not only did her death proceed from poison but i could also specify the poison â can it be possible â the symptoms are marked do you see sleep broken by nervous spasms excitation of the brain torpor of the nerve centres madame_de_saint_mã_ran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine which by some mistake perhaps has been given to her m_noirtier_de_villefort seized the doctorâ hand â_oh it is impossible said he i must be dreaming it is frightful to hear such thing from such a man as you tell me i entreat you my dear doctor that you may be deceived â doubtless i may butâ â but 30345m but i do not think so â have pity on me doctor so many dreadful thing have happened to me lately that i am on the verge of madness â has anyone besides me seen madame_de_saint_mã_ran â no
â has anything been sent for from a chemistâ that i have not examined â nothing â had madame_de_saint_mã_ran any enemies â not to my knowledge â would her death affect anyoneâ interest â_it could not indeed my daughter is her only heiressâ mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort alone oh if such a thought could present itself i would stab myself to punish my heart for having for one instant harbored it â indeed my dear friend said dâ avrigny i would not accuse anyone i speak only of an accident you understand of a mistake but whether accident or mistake the fact is there it is on my conscience and compels me to speak aloud to you make inquiry â of whom how of what â may not barrois the old servant have made a mistake and have given madame_de_saint_mã_ran a dose prepared for his master â for my father â_yes â but how could a dose prepared for m_noirtier_de_villefort poison madame_de_saint_mã_ran â nothing is more simple you know poisons become remedies in certain diseases of which paralysis is one for instance having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech to m_noirtier_de_villefort i resolved to try one last means and for three month i have been giving him brucine so that in the last dose i ordered for him there were six grains this quantity which is perfectly safe to administer to the paralyzed frame of m_noirtier_de_villefort which has become gradually accustomed to it would be sufficient to kill another person â my dear doctor there is no communication between noirtierâ apartment and that of madame_de_saint_mã_ran and barrois never entered my mother in lawâ room
in short doctor although i know you to be the most conscientious man in the world and although i place the utmost reliance in you i want notwithstanding my conviction to believe this axiom errare humanum est â is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself â why do you ask me that what do you wish â send for him i will tell him what i have seen and we will consult together and examine the body â and you will find traces of poison â no i did not say of poison but we can prove what was the state of the body we shall discover the cause of her sudden death and we shall say dear m_noirtier_de_villefort if this thing has been caused by negligence watch over your servant if from hatred watch your enemies â what do you propose to me dâ avrigny said m_noirtier_de_villefort in despair so soon as another is admitted into our secret an inquest will become necessary and an inquest in my houseâ impossible still continued the procureur looking at the doctor with uneasiness if you wish itâ if you demand it why then it shall be done but doctor you see me already so grievedâ how can i introduce into my house_of_peers so much scandal after so much sorrow my wife and my daughter would die of it and i doctorâ you know a man does not arrive at the post i occupyâ one has not been kingâ attorney twenty five year without having amassed a tolerable number of enemies mine are numerous let this affair be talked of it will be a triumph for them which will make them rejoice and cover me with shame
pardon me doctor these worldly idea were you a priest i should not dare tell you that but you are a man and you know mankind doctor pray recall your word you have said nothing have you â my dear m_noirtier_de_villefort replied the doctor my first duty is to humanity i would have saved madame_de_saint_mã_ran if science could have done it but she is dead and my duty regards the living let us bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our heart i am willing if anyone should suspect this that my silence on the subject should be imputed to my ignorance meanwhile sir watch alwaysâ watch carefully for perhaps the evil may not stop here and when you have found the culprit if you find him i will say to you you are a magistrate do as you will â i thank you doctor said m_noirtier_de_villefort with indescribable joy i never had a better friend than you and as if he feared doctor dâ avrigny would recall his promise he hurried him towards the house_of_peers when they were gone m_maximilian_morrel ventured out from under the trees and the moon shone upon his face which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a ghost i am manifestly protected in a most wonderful but most terrible manner said he but mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort poor girl how will she bear so much sorrow as he thought thus he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three window with white curtains the light had almost disappeared from the former doubtless madame m_noirtier_de_villefort had just put out her lamp and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the window
at the extremity of the building on the contrary he saw one of the three window open a wax light placed on the mantle piece threw some of its pale rays without and a shadow was seen for one moment on the balcony m_maximilian_morrel shuddered he thought he heard a sob it cannot be wondered at that his mind generally so courageous but now disturbed by the two strongest human passions love and fear was weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts although it was impossible that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort should see him hidden as he was he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him his disturbed mind told him so this double error became an irresistible reality and by one of the incomprehensible transports of youth he bounded from his hiding place and with two strides at the risk of being seen at the risk of alarming mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort at the risk of being discovered by some exclamation which might escape the young girl he crossed the flower garden which by the light of the moon resembled a large white lake and having passed the rows of orange trees which extended in front of the house_of_peers he reached the step ran quickly up and pushed the door which opened without offering any resistance mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort had not seen him her eye raised towards heaven were watching a silvery cloud gliding over the azure its form that of a shadow mounting towards heaven her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her grandmother meanwhile m_maximilian_morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase which being carpeted prevented his approach being heard and he had regained that degree of confidence that the presence of m_noirtier_de_villefort even would not have alarmed him he was quite prepared for any such encounter
he would at once approach valentineâ father and acknowledge all begging m_noirtier_de_villefort to pardon and sanction the love which united two fond and loving heart m_maximilian_morrel was mad happily he did not meet anyone now especially did he find the description mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort had given of the interior of the house_of_peers useful to him he arrived safely at the top of the staircase and while he was feeling his way a sob indicated the direction he was to take he turned back a door partly open enabled him to see his road and to hear the voice of one in sorrow he pushed the door open and entered at the other end of the room under a white sheet which covered it lay the corpse still more alarming to m_maximilian_morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard by its side on her knees and with her head buried in the cushion of an easy chair was mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort trembling and sobbing her hand extended above her head clasped and stiff she had turned from the window which remained open and was praying in accents that would have affected the most unfeeling her word were rapid incoherent unintelligible for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her utterance the moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene m_maximilian_morrel could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort suffering weeping wringing her hand before him was more than he could bear in silence he sighed and whispered a name and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chairâ a head like that of a magdalen by correggioâ was raised and turned towards him
valentine perceived him without betraying the least surprise a heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor emotions m_maximilian_morrel held out his hand to her mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort as her only apology for not having met him pointed to the corpse under the sheet and began to sob again neither dared for some time to speak in that room they hesitated to break the silence which death seemed to impose at length mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort ventured my friend said she how came you here alas i would say you are welcome had not death opened the way for you into this house_of_peers â mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said m_maximilian_morrel with a trembling voice i had waited since half past eight and did not see you come i became uneasy leaped the wall found my way through the garden when voice conversing about the fatal eventâ â what voice asked mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort m_maximilian_morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and m_noirtier_de_villefort and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hand the stiff neck and the purple lip your servant said he who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story from them i learned it all â but it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here love â forgive me replied m_maximilian_morrel i will go away â no said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort you might meet someone stay â but if anyone should come hereâ â the young girl shook her head no one will come said she do not fear there is our safeguard pointing to the bed but what has become of dâ pinay replied m_maximilian_morrel 30349 â m_franz_de_quesnel arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was dying â alas said m_maximilian_morrel with a feeling of selfish joy
for he thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely but what redoubles my sorrow continued the young girl as if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment is that the poor old lady on her death bed requested that the marriage might take place as soon as possible she also thinking to protect me was acting against me â hark said m_maximilian_morrel they both listened step were distinctly heard in the corridor and on the stairs â_it is my father who has just left his study â to accompany the doctor to the door added m_maximilian_morrel how do you know it is the doctor asked mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort astonished i imagined it must be said m_maximilian_morrel mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort looked at the young man they heard the street door close then m_noirtier_de_villefort locked the garden door and returned upstairs he stopped a moment in the anteroom as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into madame de saint mã ranâ m_maximilian_morrel concealed himself behind a door mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort remained motionless grief seeming to deprive her of all fear m_noirtier_de_villefort passed on to his own room now said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort you can neither go out by the front door nor by the garden m_maximilian_morrel looked at her with astonishment there is but one way left you that is safe said she â_it is through my grandfatherâ room she rose come she added where asked m_maximilian_morrel to my grandfatherâ room â i in noirtierâ apartment â_yes â can you mean it mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â i have long wished it he is my only remaining friend and we both need his help come â be careful mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said m_maximilian_morrel hesitating to comply with the young girlâ wishes i now see my errorâ i acted like a madman in coming in here
are you sure you are more reasonable â_yes said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and i have but one scruple that of leaving my dear grandmotherâ remains which i had undertaken to watch â mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said m_maximilian_morrel death is in itself sacred â_yes said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort besides it will not be for long she then crossed the corridor and led the way down a narrow staircase to noirtierâ room m_maximilian_morrel followed her on tiptoe at the door they found the old servant barrois said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort shut the door and let no one come in she passed first m_noirtier_de_villefort seated in his chair and listening to every sound was watching the door he saw mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and his eye brightened there was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck the old man and immediately his bright eye began to interrogate dear grandfather said she hurriedly you know poor grandmamma died an hour since and now i have no friend in the world but you his expressive eye evinced the greatest tenderness to you alone then may i confide my sorrows and my hopes the paralytic motioned â_yes mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort took maximilianâ hand look attentively then at this gentleman the old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on m_maximilian_morrel â_it is m_maximilian_morrel said she the son of that good merchant of marseilles whom you doubtless recollect â_yes said the old man he brings an irreproachable name which m_maximilian_morrel is likely to render glorious since at thirty year of age he is a captain an officer of the legion of honor the old man signified that he recollected him well grandpapa said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort kneeling before him and pointing to m_maximilian_morrel i love him and will be only his were i compelled to marry another i would destroy myself
the eye of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts you like m_maximilian_morrel do you not grandpapa asked mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â_yes â and you will protect us who are your child against the will of my father m_noirtier_de_villefort cast an intelligent glance at m_maximilian_morrel as if to say perhaps i may m_maximilian_morrel understood him mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars said he you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your deceased grandmotherâ room will you allow me the honor of a few minutesâ conversation with m_noirtier_de_villefort â that is it said the old manâ eye then he looked anxiously at mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort do you fear he will not understand â_yes â_oh we have so often spoken of you that he knows exactly how i talk to you then turning to m_maximilian_morrel with an adorable smile although shaded by sorrow â he knows everything i know said she mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort arose placed a chair for m_maximilian_morrel requested barrois not to admit anyone and having tenderly embraced her grandfather and sorrowfully taken leave of m_maximilian_morrel she went away to prove to m_noirtier_de_villefort that he was in valentineâ confidence and knew all their secrets m_maximilian_morrel took the dictionary a pen and some paper and placed them all on a table where there was a light but first said m_maximilian_morrel allow me sir to tell you who i am how much i love mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and what are my designs respecting her m_noirtier_de_villefort made a sign that he would listen it was an imposing sight to witness this old man apparently a mere useless burden becoming the sole protector support and adviser of the lovers who were both young beautiful and strong his remarkably noble and austere expression struck m_maximilian_morrel who began his story with trembling
he related the manner in which he had become acquainted with mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and how he had loved her and that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort in her solitude and her misfortune had accepted the offer of his devotion he told him his birth his position his fortune and more than once when he consulted the look of the paralytic that look answered that is good proceed â and now said m_maximilian_morrel when he had finished the first part of his recital now i have told you of my love and my hopes may i inform you of my intentions â_yes signified the old man this was our resolution a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate in which i intended to carry off mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort to my sisterâ house_of_peers to marry her and to wait respectfully de villefortâ pardon â no said m_noirtier_de_villefort we must not do so â no â you do not sanction our project â no â there is another way said m_maximilian_morrel the old manâ interrogative eye said which â i will go continued m_maximilian_morrel i will seek m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinayâ i am happy to be able to mention this in mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars de villefortâ absenceâ and will conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to challenge me noirtierâ look continued to interrogate you wish to know what i will do â_yes â i will find him as i told you
i will tell him the ties which bind me to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort if he be a sensible man he will prove it by renouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed and will secure my friendship and love until death if he refuse either through interest or ridiculous pride after i have proved to him that he would be forcing my wife from me that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort loves me and will have no other i will fight with him give him every advantage and i shall kill him or he will kill me if i am victorious he will not marry mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and if i die i am very sure mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort will not marry him m_noirtier_de_villefort watched with indescribable pleasure this noble and sincere countenance on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to a sound and faithful drawing still when m_maximilian_morrel had finished he shut his eye several time which was his manner of saying no â no said m_maximilian_morrel you disapprove of this second project as you did of the first â i do signified the old man but what then must be done asked m_maximilian_morrel madame de saint mã ranâ last request was that the marriage might not be delayed must i let thing take their course m_noirtier_de_villefort did not move i understand said m_maximilian_morrel i am to wait â_yes â but delay may ruin our plan sir replied the young man alone mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort has no power she will be compelled to submit i am here almost miraculously and can scarcely hope for so good an opportunity to occur again believe me there are only the two plans i have proposed to you forgive my vanity and tell me which you prefer
do you authorize mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort to intrust herself to my honor â no â do you prefer i should seek dâ pinay â no â whence then will come the help we needâ from chance resumed m_maximilian_morrel no â from you â_yes â you thoroughly understand me sir pardon my eagerness for my life depends on your answer will our help come from you â_yes â you are sure of it â_yes there was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer no one could at any rate doubt his will if they did his power â_oh thank you a thousand time but how unless a miracle should restore your speech your gesture your movement how can you chained to that armchair dumb and motionless oppose this marriage a smile lit up the old manâ face a strange smile of the eye in a paralyzed face then i must wait asked the young man â_yes â but the contract the same smile returned will you assure me it shall not be signed â_yes said m_noirtier_de_villefort the contract shall not be signed cried m_maximilian_morrel â_oh pardon me sir i can scarcely realize so great a happiness will they not sign it â no said the paralytic notwithstanding that assurance m_maximilian_morrel still hesitated this promise of an impotent old man was so strange that instead of being the result of the power of his will it might emanate from enfeebled organs is it not natural that the madman ignorant of his folly should attempt thing beyond his power the weak man talks of burdens he can raise the timid of giants he can confront the poor of treasures he spends the most humble peasant in the height of his pride calls himself jupiter
whether m_noirtier_de_villefort understood the young manâ indecision or whether he had not full confidence in his docility he looked uneasily at him what do you wish sir asked m_maximilian_morrel that i should renew my promise of remaining tranquil noirtierâ eye remained fixed and firm as if to imply that a promise did not suffice then it passed from his face to his hand shall i swear to you sir asked m_maximilian_morrel â_yes said the paralytic with the same solemnity m_maximilian_morrel understood that the old man attached great importance to an oath he extended his hand i swear to you on my honor said he to await your decision respecting the course i am to pursue with dâ pinay â that is right said the old man now said m_maximilian_morrel do you wish me to retire â_yes â without seeing mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â_yes m_maximilian_morrel made a sign that he was ready to obey but said he first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now noirtierâ expression could not be understood the young man pressed his lip on the same spot on the old manâ forehead where valentineâ had been then he bowed a second time and retired he found outside the door the old servant to whom mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort had given directions m_maximilian_morrel was conducted along a dark passage which led to a little door opening on the garden soon found the spot where he had entered with the assistance of the shrubs gained the top of the wall and by his ladder was in an instant in the clover field where his cabriolet was still waiting for him he got in it and thoroughly wearied by so many emotions arrived about midnight in the rue meslay threw himself on his bed and slept soundly
volume four 40010m 40012m 40020m chapter 74 the m_noirtier_de_villefort family vault two day after a considerable crowd was assembled towards ten oâ clock in the morning around the door of de villefortâ house_of_peers and a long file of mourning coaches and private carriage extended along the faubourg saint honorã and the rue de la pã piniã re among them was one of a very singular form which appeared to have come from a distance it was a kind of covered wagon painted black and was one of the first to arrive inquiry was made and it was ascertained that by a strange coincidence this carriage contained the corpse of the marquis de madame_de_saint_mã_ran and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow two their number was great the marquis de madame_de_saint_mã_ran one of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of louis_xviii and king charles had preserved a great number of friend and these added to the personages whom the usages of society gave m_noirtier_de_villefort a claim on formed a considerable body due information was given to the authorities and permission obtained that the two funerals should take place at the same time a second hearse decked with the same funereal pomp was brought to de villefortâ door and the coffin removed into it from the post wagon the two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of pã re lachaise where m_noirtier_de_villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his family the remains of poor renã_e were already deposited there and now after ten year of separation her father and mother were to be reunited with her
the parisians always curious always affected by funereal display looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracyâ the greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles in one of the mourning coaches m_beauchamp m_lucien_debray and baron_de_chã_teau_renaud were talking of the very sudden death of the marchioness i saw madame_de_saint_mã_ran only last year at marseilles when i was coming back from algiers said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred year old from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body how old was she â m_franz_de_quesnel assured me replied monsieur_albert that she was sixty six year old but she has not died of old age but of grief it appears that since the death of the marquis which affected her very deeply she has not completely recovered her reason â but of what disease then did she die asked m_lucien_debray â_it is said to have been a congestion of the brain or apoplexy which is the same thing is it not â nearly â_it is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy said m_beauchamp madame_de_saint_mã_ran whom i once saw was short of slender form and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of madame_de_saint_mã_ran â at any rate said monsieur_albert whatever disease or doctor may have killed her m_noirtier_de_villefort or rather mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort or still rather our friend m_franz_de_quesnel inherits a magnificent fortune amounting i believe to 80 000 livres per annum â and this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin m_noirtier_de_villefort â that is a tenacious old grandfather said m_beauchamp tenacem propositi virum
i think he must have made an agreement with death to outlive all his heirs and he appears likely to succeed he resembles the old conventionalist of 93 who said to napoleon in 1814 you bend because your empire is a young stem weakened by rapid growth take the republic for a tutor let us return with renewed strength to the battle field and i promise you 500 000 soldiers another marengo and a second austerlitz idea do not become extinct sire they slumber sometimes but only revive the stronger before they sleep entirely â idea and man appeared the same to him said monsieur_albert one thing only puzzles me namely how m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay will like a grandfather who cannot be separated from his wife but where is m_franz_de_quesnel â in the first carriage with m_noirtier_de_villefort who considers him already as one of the family 40024m such was the conversation in almost all the carriage these two sudden death so quickly following each other astonished everyone but no one suspected the terrible secret which dâ avrigny had communicated in his nocturnal walk to m_noirtier_de_villefort they arrived in about an hour at the cemetery the weather was mild but dull and in harmony with the funeral ceremony among the groups which flocked towards the family vault baron_de_chã_teau_renaud recognized m_maximilian_morrel who had come alone in a cabriolet and walked silently along the path bordered with yew trees you here said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud passing his arm through the young captainâ â are you a friend of villefortâ how is it that i have never met you at his house_of_peers â i am no acquaintance of de villefortâ â answered m_maximilian_morrel but i was of madame_de_saint_mã_ran monsieur_albert came up to them at this moment with m_franz_de_quesnel
â the time and place are but ill suited for an introduction said monsieur_albert but we are not superstitious m_maximilian_morrel allow me to present to you m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay a delightful travelling companion with whom i made the tour of italy my dear m_franz_de_quesnel m_maximilian_morrel an excellent friend i have acquired in your absence and whose name you will hear me mention every time i make any allusion to affection wit or amiability m_maximilian_morrel hesitated for a moment he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to m_franz_de_quesnel mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort is in deep sorrow is she not said m_lucien_debray to m_franz_de_quesnel extremely replied he she looked so pale this morning i scarcely knew her these apparently simple word pierced m_maximilian_morrel to the heart this man had seen mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and spoken to her the young and high spirited officer required all his strength of mind to resist breaking his oath he took the arm of baron_de_chã_teau_renaud and turned towards the vault where the attendants had already placed the two coffins this is a magnificent habitation said m_beauchamp looking towards the mausoleum a summer and winter palace you will in turn enter it my dear dâ pinay for you will soon be numbered as one of the family i as a philosopher should like a little country house_of_peers a cottage down there under the trees without so many free stones over my poor body in dying i will say to those around me what voltaire wrote to piron eo rus and all will be over but come m_franz_de_quesnel take courage your wife is an heiress â indeed m_beauchamp you are unbearable
politics has made you laugh at everything and political man have made you disbelieve everything but when you have the honor of associating with ordinary man and the pleasure of leaving politics for a moment try to find your affectionate heart which you leave with your stick when you go to the chamber â but tell me said m_beauchamp what is life is it not a halt in deathâ anteroom 40026m i am prejudiced against m_beauchamp said monsieur_albert drawing m_franz_de_quesnel away and leaving the former to finish his philosophical dissertation with m_lucien_debray the m_noirtier_de_villefort vault formed a square of white stones about twenty foot high an interior partition separated the two families and each apartment had its entrance door here were not as in other tombs ignoble drawers one above another where thrift bestows its dead and labels them like specimens in a museum all that was visible within the bronze gates was a gloomy looking room separated by a wall from the vault itself the two door before mentioned were in the middle of this wall and enclosed the m_noirtier_de_villefort and madame_de_saint_mã_ran coffins there grief might freely expend itself without being disturbed by the trifling loungers who came from a picnic party to visit pã re lachaise or by lovers who make it their rendezvous the two coffins were placed on trestles previously prepared for their reception in the right hand crypt belonging to the madame_de_saint_mã_ran family m_noirtier_de_villefort m_franz_de_quesnel and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary as the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door and there was no address given the party all separated baron_de_chã_teau_renaud monsieur_albert and m_maximilian_morrel went one way and m_lucien_debray and m_beauchamp the other
franz remained with m_noirtier_de_villefort at the gate of the cemetery m_maximilian_morrel made an excuse to wait he saw m_franz_de_quesnel and m_noirtier_de_villefort get into the same mourning coach and thought this meeting forboded evil he then returned to paris and although in the same carriage with baron_de_chã_teau_renaud and monsieur_albert he did not hear one word of their conversation as m_franz_de_quesnel was about to take leave of m_noirtier_de_villefort when shall i see you again said the latter at what time you please sir replied m_franz_de_quesnel as soon as possible â i am at your command sir shall we return together â if not unpleasant to you â on the contrary i shall feel much pleasure thus the future father and son in law stepped into the same carriage and m_maximilian_morrel seeing them pass became uneasy m_noirtier_de_villefort and m_franz_de_quesnel returned to the faubourg saint honorã the procureur without going to see either his wife or his daughter went at once to his study and offering the young man a chair m dâ pinay said he allow me to remind you at this moment which is perhaps not so ill chosen as at first sight may appear for obedience to the wishes of the departed is the first offering which should be made at their tomb allow me then to remind you of the wish expressed by madame_de_saint_mã_ran on her death bed that valentineâ wedding might not be deferred you know the affairs of the deceased are in perfect order and her will bequeaths to mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort the entire property of the madame_de_saint_mã_ran family the notary showed me the documents yesterday which will enable us to draw up the contract immediately you may call on the notary deschamps place beauveau faubourg saint honorã and you have my authority to inspect those deeds â sir replied dâ pinay

valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her temples round her eye and down her cheeks m_franz_de_quesnel was deeply affected baron_de_chã_teau_renaud and monsieur_albert looked at each other with amazement the ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared more sorrowful than did that which was about to begin madame m_noirtier_de_villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain and as she constantly bent over her child it was difficult to read the expression of her face m_noirtier_de_villefort was as usual unmoved the notary after having according to the customary method arranged the paper on the table taken his place in an armchair and raised his spectacles turned towards m_franz_de_quesnel are you m_franz_de_quesnel baron dâ pinay asked he although he knew it perfectly â_yes sir replied m_franz_de_quesnel the notary bowed i have then to inform you sir at the request of m_noirtier_de_villefort that your projected marriage with mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort has changed the feeling of m_noirtier_de_villefort towards his grandchild and that he disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left her let me hasten to add continued he that the testator having only the right to alienate a part of his fortune and having alienated it all the will will not bear scrutiny and is declared null and void â_yes said m_noirtier_de_villefort but i warn dâ pinay that during my life time my fatherâ will shall never be questioned my position forbidding any doubt to be entertained 40032m sir said m_franz_de_quesnel i regret much that such a question has been raised in the presence of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort i have never inquired the amount of her fortune which however limited it may be exceeds mine
my family has sought consideration in this alliance with m_noirtier_de_villefort all i seek is happiness mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort imperceptibly thanked him while two silent tears rolled down her cheeks besides sir said m_noirtier_de_villefort addressing himself to his future son in law excepting the loss of a portion of your hopes this unexpected will need not personally wound you noirtierâ weakness of mind sufficiently explains it it is not because mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort is going to marry you that he is angry but because she will marry a union with any other would have caused him the same sorrow old age is selfish sir and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort has been a faithful companion to m_noirtier_de_villefort which she cannot be when she becomes the baroness dâ pinay my fatherâ melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from understanding and i am perfectly convinced that at the present time although he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married m_noirtier_de_villefort has even forgotten the name of his intended grandson m_noirtier_de_villefort had scarcely said this when the door opened and barrois appeared gentlemen said he in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstances â gentlemen m_noirtier_de_villefort wishes to speak immediately to m_franz_de_quesnel baron dâ pinay he as well as the notary that there might be no mistake in the person gave all his titles to the bridegroom elect m_noirtier_de_villefort started madame m_noirtier_de_villefort let her son slip from her knees mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort rose pale and dumb as a statue monsieur_albert and baron_de_chã_teau_renaud exchanged a second look more full of amazement than the first the notary looked at m_noirtier_de_villefort â_it is impossible said the procureur m
dâ pinay cannot leave the drawing room at present â_it is at this moment replied barrois with the same firmness that m_noirtier_de_villefort my master wishes to speak on important subjects to m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay â grandpapa m_noirtier_de_villefort can speak now then said edward with his habitual quickness however his remark did not make madame m_noirtier_de_villefort even smile so much was every mind engaged and so solemn was the situation tell nortier resumed m_noirtier_de_villefort that what he demands is impossible â then nortier gives notice to these gentlemen replied barrois that he will give order to be carried to the drawing room astonishment was at its height something like a smile was perceptible on madame de villefortâ countenance mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort instinctively raised her eye as if to thank heaven pray go mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said m_noirtier_de_villefort and see what this new fancy of your grandfatherâ is mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort rose quickly and was hastening joyfully towards the door when m_noirtier_de_villefort altered his intention stop said he i will go with you â excuse me sir said m_franz_de_quesnel since m_noirtier_de_villefort sent for me i am ready to attend to his wish besides i shall be happy to pay my respects to him not having yet had the honor of doing so â pray sir said m_noirtier_de_villefort with marked uneasiness do not disturb yourself 40032m forgive me sir said m_franz_de_quesnel in a resolute tone i would not lose this opportunity of proving to m_noirtier_de_villefort how wrong it would be of him to encourage feelings of dislike to me which i am determined to conquer whatever they may be by my devotion and without listening to m_noirtier_de_villefort he arose and followed mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort who was running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock to cling to m_noirtier_de_villefort followed them
chã teau renaud and viscount_albert_de_morcerf exchanged a third look of still increasing wonder chapter 75 a signed statement m_noirtier_de_villefort was prepared to receive them dressed in black and installed in his armchair when the three person he expected had entered he looked at the door which his valet immediately closed listen whispered m_noirtier_de_villefort to mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort who could not conceal her joy if m_noirtier_de_villefort wishes to communicate anything which would delay your marriage i forbid you to understand him mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort blushed but did not answer m_noirtier_de_villefort approached m_noirtier_de_villefort here is m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay said he you requested to see him we have all wished for this interview and i trust it will convince you how ill formed are your objections to valentineâ marriage m_noirtier_de_villefort answered only by a look which made villefortâ blood run cold he motioned to mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort to approach in a moment thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather she understood that he asked for a key then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the window she opened the drawer and found a key and understanding that was what he wanted again watched his eye which turned toward an old secretaire which had been neglected for many year and was supposed to contain nothing but useless documents shall i open the secretaire asked mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â_yes said the old man and the drawers â_yes â those at the side â no â the middle one â_yes mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort opened it and drew out a bundle of paper is that what you wish for asked she no she took successively all the other paper out till the drawer was empty but there are no more said she noirtierâ eye was fixed on the dictionary â_yes i understand grandfather said the young girl 40036m
she pointed to each letter of the alphabet at the letter the old man stopped her she opened and found the word secret â ah is there a secret spring said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â_yes said m_noirtier_de_villefort and who knows it m_noirtier_de_villefort looked at the door where the servant had gone out barrois said she â_yes â shall i call him â_yes mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort went to the door and called barrois villefortâ impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead and m_franz_de_quesnel was stupefied the old servant came barrois said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort my grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the secretaire but there is a secret spring in it which you knowâ will you open it barrois looked at the old man obey said noirtierâ intelligent eye barrois touched a spring the false bottom came out and they saw a bundle of paper tied with a black string is that what you wish for said barrois â_yes â shall i give these paper to m_noirtier_de_villefort â no â to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â no â to m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay â_yes m_franz_de_quesnel astonished advanced a step to me sir said he â_yes m_franz_de_quesnel took them from barrois and casting a glance at the cover read â to be given after my death to general durand who shall bequeath the packet to his son with an injunction to preserve it as containing an important document â well sir asked m_franz_de_quesnel what do you wish me to do with this paper â to preserve it sealed up as it is doubtless said the procureur no replied m_noirtier_de_villefort eagerly do you wish him to read it said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â_yes replied the old man you understand baron my grandfather wishes you to read this paper said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort then let us sit down said m_noirtier_de_villefort impatiently
for it will take some time â sit down said the old man m_noirtier_de_villefort took a chair but mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort remained standing by her fatherâ side and m_franz_de_quesnel before him holding the mysterious paper in his hand read said the old man m_franz_de_quesnel untied it and in the midst of the most profound silence read 40038m â extract of the report of a meeting of the bonapartist club in the rue saint jacques held february 5th 1815 â m_franz_de_quesnel stopped february 5th 1815 said he â_it is the day my father was murdered mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and m_noirtier_de_villefort were dumb the eye of the old man alone seemed to say clearly go on â but it was on leaving this club said he my father disappeared noirtierâ eye continued to say read he resumed â the undersigned louis_xviii jacques beaurepaire lieutenant colonel of artillery tienne duchampy general of brigade and claude lecharpal keeper of woods and forests declare that on the 4th of february a letter arrived from the island of elba recommending to the kindness and the confidence of the bonapartist club general flavien m_franz_de_quesnel who having served the emperor from 1804 to 1814 was supposed to be devoted to the interests of the napoleon dynasty notwithstanding the title of baron which louis_xviii had just granted to him with his estate of pinay 400340m â a note was in consequence addressed to general m_franz_de_quesnel begging him to be present at the meeting next day the 5th the note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house_of_peers where the meeting was to be held it bore no signature but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine oâ clock the meetings were always held from that time till midnight
at nine oâ clock the president of the club presented himself the general was ready the president informed him that one of the conditions of his introduction was that he should be eternally ignorant of the place of meeting and that he would allow his eye to be bandaged swearing that he would not endeavor to take off the bandage general m_franz_de_quesnel accepted the condition and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road they took the generalâ carriage was ready but the president told him it was impossible for him to use it since it was useless to blindfold the master if the coachman knew through what streets he went what must be done then asked the general â i have my carriage here said the president â have you then so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know â â our coachman is a member of the club said the president we shall be driven by a state councillor â â then we run another risk said the general laughing that of being upset we insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting but that he came willingly when they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eye to be bandaged to which he made no opposition on the road the president thought he saw the general make an attempt to remove the handkerchief and reminded him of his oath sure enough said the general the carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the rue saint jacques
the general alighted leaning on the arm of the president of whose dignity he was not aware considering him simply as a member of the club they went through the alley mounted a flight of stairs and entered the assembly room â the deliberations had already begun the members apprised of the sort of presentation which was to be made that evening were all in attendance when in the middle of the room the general was invited to remove his bandage he did so immediately and was surprised to see so many well known face in a society of whose existence he had till then been ignorant they questioned him as to his sentiments but he contented himself with answering that the letter from the island of elba ought to have informed themâ â m_franz_de_quesnel interrupted himself by saying my father was a royalist they need not have asked his sentiments which were well known â and hence said m_noirtier_de_villefort arose my affection for your father my dear m_franz_de_quesnel opinions held in common are a ready bond of union â read again said the old man m_franz_de_quesnel continued â the president then sought to make him speak more explicitly but m_franz_de_quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with him he was then informed of the contents of the letter from the island of elba in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be likely to advance the interests of their party one paragraph spoke of the return of bonaparte and promised another letter and further details on the arrival of the pharaon belonging to the shipbuilder m_maximilian_morrel of marseilles whose captain was entirely devoted to the emperor
during all this time the general on whom they thought to have relied as on a brother manifested evidently signs of discontent and repugnance when the reading was finished he remained silent with knitted brows â well asked the president what do you say to this letter general â â i say that it is too soon after declaring myself for louis_xviii to break my vow in behalf of the ex emperor this answer was too clear to permit of any mistake as to his sentiments general said the president we acknowledge no king louis_xviii or an ex emperor but his majesty the emperor and king driven from france which is his kingdom by violence and treason â â excuse me gentlemen said the general you may not acknowledge louis_xviii but i do as he has made me a baron and a field marshal and i shall never forget that for these two titles i am indebted to his happy return to france â â sir said the president rising with gravity be careful what you say your word clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you in the island of elba and have deceived us the communication has been made to you in consequence of the confidence placed in you and which does you honor now we discover our error a title and promotion attach you to the government we wish to overturn we will not constrain you to help us we enroll no one against his conscience but we will compel you to act generously even if you are not disposed to do so â â you would call acting generously knowing your conspiracy and not informing against you that is what i should call becoming your accomplice you see i am more candid than you â â ah my father said m_franz_de_quesnel interrupting himself
â i understand now why they murdered him mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort could not help casting one glance towards the young man whose filial enthusiasm it was delightful to behold m_noirtier_de_villefort walked to and fro behind them m_noirtier_de_villefort watched the expression of each one and preserved his dignified and commanding attitude m_franz_de_quesnel returned to the manuscript and continued â sir said the president you have been invited to join this assemblyâ you were not forced here it was proposed to you to come blindfoldedâ you accepted when you complied with this twofold request you well knew we did not wish to secure the throne of louis_xviii or we should not take so much care to avoid the vigilance of the police it would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our secret and then to remove it that you may ruin those who have confided in you no no you must first say if you declare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns or for his majesty the emperor â â i am a royalist replied the general i have taken the oath of allegiance to louis_xviii and i will adhere to it these word were followed by a general murmur and it was evident that several of the members were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of his rashness â the president again arose and having imposed silence said â sir you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you the general putting his hand on his sword exclaimed â if
you talk of honor do not begin by disavowing its laws and impose nothing by violence â â and you sir continued the president with a calmness still more terrible than the generalâ anger i advise you not to touch your sword the general looked around him with slight uneasiness however he did not yield but calling up all his fortitude said â i will not swear â â then you must die replied the president calmly dâ pinay became very pale he looked round him a second time several members of the club were whispering and getting their arm from under their cloaks general said the president do not alarm yourself you are among man of honor who will use every means to convince you before resorting to the last extremity but as you have said you are among conspirators you are in possession of our secret and you must restore it to us a significant silence followed these word and as the general did not reply â close the door said the president to the door keeper 40042 â the same deadly silence succeeded these word then the general advanced and making a violent effort to control his feelings â i have a son said he and i ought to think of him finding myself among assassins â â general said the chief of the assembly one man may insult fiftyâ it is the privilege of weakness but he does wrong to use his privilege follow my advice swear and do not insult the general again daunted by the superiority of the chief hesitated a moment then advancing to the presidentâ desk â what is the form said he
â â_it is this â i swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what i have seen and heard on the 5th of february 1815 between nine and ten oâ clock in the evening and i plead guilty of death should i ever violate this oath â the general appeared to be affected by a nervous tremor which prevented his answering for some moment then overcoming his manifest repugnance he pronounced the required oath but in so low a tone as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the members who insisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly which he did â now am i at liberty to retire said the general the president rose appointed three members to accompany him and got into the carriage with the general after bandaging his eye one of those three members was the coachman who had driven them there the other members silently dispersed where do you wish to be taken asked the president â anywhere out of your presence replied dâ pinay beware sir replied the president you are no longer in the assembly and have only to do with individuals do not insult them unless you wish to be held responsible but instead of listening dâ pinay went on â you are still as brave in your carriage as in your assembly because you are still four against one the president stopped the coach they were at that part of the quai des ormes where the step lead down to the river why do you stop here asked dâ pinay â because sir said the president you have insulted a man and that man will not go one step farther without demanding honorable reparation â â another method of assassination said the general shrugging his shoulders â make
no noise sir unless you wish me to consider you as one of the man of whom you spoke just now as cowards who take their weakness for a shield you are alone one alone shall answer you you have a sword by your side i have one in my cane you have no witness one of these gentlemen will serve you now if you please remove your bandage the general tore the handkerchief from his eye at last said he i shall know with whom i have to do they opened the door and the four man alighted â m_franz_de_quesnel again interrupted himself and wiped the cold drops from his brow there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling pallor these details of his fatherâ death which had hitherto been a mystery mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort clasped her hand as if in prayer m_noirtier_de_villefort looked at m_noirtier_de_villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and pride m_franz_de_quesnel continued â_it was as we said the fifth of february for three day the mercury had been five or six degrees below freezing and the step were covered with ice the general was stout and tall the president offered him the side of the railing to assist him in getting down the two witnesses followed it was a dark night the ground from the step to the river was covered with snow and hoarfrost the water of the river looked black and deep one of the seconds went for a lantern in a coal barge near and by its light they examined the weapons the presidentâ sword which was simply as he had said one he carried in his cane was five inches shorter than the generalâ and had no guard
the general proposed to cast lots for the swords but the president said it was he who had given the provocation and when he had given it he had supposed each would use his own arm the witnesses endeavored to insist but the president bade them be silent the lantern was placed on the ground the two adversaries took their stations and the duel began the light made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning as for the man they were scarcely perceptible the darkness was so great 40044 â general dâ pinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army but he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and fell the witnesses thought he was dead but his adversary who knew he had not struck him offered him the assistance of his hand to rise the circumstance irritated instead of calming the general and he rushed on his adversary but his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken he received him on his sword and three time the general drew back on finding himself too closely engaged and then returned to the charge at the third he fell again they thought he slipped as at first and the witnesses seeing he did not move approached and endeavored to raise him but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with blood the general who had almost fainted revived ah said he they have sent some fencing master to fight with me the president without answering approached the witness who held the lantern and raising his sleeve showed him two wounds he had received in his arm then opening his coat and unbuttoning his waistcoat displayed his side pierced with a third wound
still he had not even uttered a sigh general dâ pinay died five minute after â m_franz_de_quesnel read these last word in a voice so choked that they were hardly audible and then stopped passing his hand over his eye as if to dispel a cloud but after a momentâ silence he continued â the president went up the step after pushing his sword into his cane a track of blood on the snow marked his course he had scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the waterâ it was the generalâ body which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after ascertaining that he was dead the general fell then in a loyal duel and not in ambush as it might have been reported in proof of this we have signed this paper to establish the truth of the facts lest the moment should arrive when either of the actors in this terrible scene should be accused of premeditated murder or of infringement of the laws of honor â signed beaurepaire duchampy and lecharpal â when m_franz_de_quesnel had finished reading this account so dreadful for a son when mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort pale with emotion had wiped away a tear when m_noirtier_de_villefort trembling and crouched in a corner had endeavored to lessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man â sir said dâ pinay to m_noirtier_de_villefort since you are well acquainted with all these details which are attested by honorable signatures since you appear to take some interest in me although you have only manifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow refuse me not one final satisfactionâ tell me
the name of the president of the club that i may at least know who killed my father m_noirtier_de_villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort who understood sooner than anyone her grandfatherâ answer and who had often seen two scars upon his right arm drew back a few step mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars said m_franz_de_quesnel turning towards mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort unite your efforts with mine to find out the name of the man who made me an orphan at two year of age mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort remained dumb and motionless hold sir said m_noirtier_de_villefort do not prolong this dreadful scene the name have been purposely concealed my father himself does not know who this president was and if he knows he cannot tell you proper name are not in the dictionary â_oh misery cried m_franz_de_quesnel the only hope which sustained me and enabled me to read to the end was that of knowing at least the name of him who killed my father sir sir cried he turning to m_noirtier_de_villefort do what you canâ make me understand in some way â_yes replied m_noirtier_de_villefort â_oh mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort cried m_franz_de_quesnel your grandfather says he can indicate the person help me lend me your assistance m_noirtier_de_villefort looked at the dictionary m_franz_de_quesnel took it with a nervous trembling and repeated the letter of the alphabet successively until he came to at that letter the old man signified â_yes â â repeated m_franz_de_quesnel the young manâ finger glided over the word but at each one m_noirtier_de_villefort answered by a negative sign mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort hid her head between her hand at length m_franz_de_quesnel arrived at the word myself 40046 â_yes â you cried m_franz_de_quesnel whose hair stood on end you noirtierâ you killed my father â_yes replied m_noirtier_de_villefort fixing a majestic look on the young man
franz fell powerless on a chair m_noirtier_de_villefort opened the door and escaped for the idea had entered his mind to stifle the little remaining life in the heart of this terrible old man chapter 76 progress of m_andrea_cavalcanti the younger meanwhile m_andrea_cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service not in the army of his majesty the emperor of austria but at the gaming table of the baths of lucca of which he was one of the most assiduous courtiers he had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed character of father m_andrea_cavalcanti at his departure inherited all the paper which proved that he had indeed the honor of being the son of the marquis bartolomeo_cavalcanti and the marchioness oliva corsinari he was now fairly launched in that parisian society which gives such ready access to foreigners and treats them not as they really are but as they wish to be considered besides what is required of a young man in paris to speak its language tolerably to make a good appearance to be a good gamester and to pay in cash they are certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a frenchman m_andrea_cavalcanti had then in a fortnight attained a very fair position he was called count he was said to possess 50 000 livres per annum and his fatherâ immense riches buried in the quarries of saravezza were a constant theme a learned man before whom the last circumstance was mentioned as a fact declared he had seen the quarries in question which gave great weight to assertions hitherto somewhat doubtful but which now assumed the garb of reality
such was the state of society in paris at the period we bring before our readers when count_of_monte_cristo went one evening to pay mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars a visit mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was out but the count was asked to go and see the baroness and he accepted the invitation it was never without a nervous shudder since the dinner at auteuil and the events which followed it that madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars heard monte cristoâ name announced if he did not come the painful sensation became most intense if on the contrary he appeared his noble countenance his brilliant eye his amiability his polite attention even towards madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars soon dispelled every impression of fear it appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such delightfully pleasing manner should entertain evil designs against her besides the most corrupt mind only suspect evil when it would answer some interested endâ useless injury is repugnant to every mind 40048 when count_of_monte_cristo entered the boudoir to which we have already once introduced our readers and where the baroness was examining some drawings which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them with m_andrea_cavalcanti his presence soon produced its usual effect and it was with smile that the baroness received the count although she had been a little disconcerted at the announcement of his name the latter took in the whole scene at a glance the baroness was partially reclining on a sofa mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars sat near her and m_andrea_cavalcanti was standing
cavalcanti dressed in black like one of goetheâ heroes with varnished shoes and white silk open worked stockings passed a white and tolerably nice looking hand through his light hair and so displayed a sparkling diamond that in spite of monte cristoâ advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger this movement was accompanied by killing glances at mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and by sighs launched in the same direction mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was still the sameâ cold beautiful and satirical not one of these glances nor one sigh was lost on her they might have been said to fall on the shield of minerva which some philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of sappho mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars bowed coldly to the count and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voice being heard in connection with occasional notes of the piano assured count_of_monte_cristo that mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars preferred to his society and to that of m_andrea_cavalcanti the company of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly dâ armilly her singing teacher it was then especially while conversing with madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation that the count noticed m_andrea_cavalcanti cavalcantiâ solicitude his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass and of manifesting his admiration the banker soon returned his first look was certainly directed towards count_of_monte_cristo but the second was for m_andrea_cavalcanti as for his wife he bowed to her as some husbands do to their wife but in a way that bachelors will never comprehend until a very extensive code is published on conjugal life have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars to m_andrea_cavalcanti
â alas no sir replied m_andrea_cavalcanti with a sigh still more remarkable than the former one mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars immediately advanced towards the door and opened it 40050 the two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair at the piano accompanying themselves each with one hand a fancy to which they had accustomed themselves and performed admirably mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars dâ armilly whom they then perceived through the open doorway formed with mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars one of the tableaux vivants of which the germans are so fond she was somewhat beautiful and exquisitely formedâ a little fairy like figure with large curls falling on her neck which was rather too long as perugino sometimes makes his virgins and her eye dull from fatigue she was said to have a weak chest and like antonia in the cremona violin she would die one day while singing count_of_monte_cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this sanctum it was the first time he had ever seen mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars dâ armilly of whom he had heard much well said the banker to his daughter are we then all to be excluded he then led the young man into the study and either by chance or manå uvre the door was partially closed after m_andrea_cavalcanti so that from the place where they sat neither the count nor the baroness could see anything but as the banker had accompanied m_andrea_cavalcanti madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars appeared to take no notice of it the count soon heard andreaâ voice singing a corsican song accompanied by the piano while the count smiled at hearing this song which made him lose sight of m_andrea_cavalcanti in the recollection of m_benedetto madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was boasting to count_of_monte_cristo of her husbandâ strength of mind who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand franc by a failure at milan
the praise was well deserved for had not the count heard it from the baroness or by one of those means by which he knew everything the baronâ countenance would not have led him to suspect it hem thought count_of_monte_cristo he begins to conceal his losses a month since he boasted of them then aloud â_oh madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is so skilful he will soon regain at the bourse what he loses elsewhere â i see that you participate in a prevalent error said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars what is it said count_of_monte_cristo that mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars speculates whereas he never does â truly madame i recollect m_lucien_debray told meâ apropos what has become of him i have seen nothing of him the last three or four day â nor i said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars but you began a sentence sir and did not finish â which â m_lucien_debray had told youâ â ah yes he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of speculation â i was once very fond of it but i do not indulge now â then you are wrong madame fortune is precarious and if i were a woman and fate had made me a bankerâ wife whatever might be my confidence in my husbandâ good fortune still in speculation you know there is great risk well i would secure for myself a fortune independent of him even if i acquired it by placing my interests in hand unknown to him madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars blushed in spite of all her efforts stay said count_of_monte_cristo as though he had not observed her confusion i have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the neapolitan bonds â i have noneâ nor have i ever possessed any but really we have talked long enough of money
count we are like two stockbrokers have you heard how fate is persecuting the poor villeforts â what has happened said the count simulating total ignorance you know the marquis of madame_de_saint_mã_ran died a few day after he had set out on his journey to paris and the marchioness a few day after her arrival â_yes said count_of_monte_cristo i have heard that but as claudius said to hamlet â_it is a law of nature their father died before them and they mourned their loss they will die before their child who will in their turn grieve for them â but that is not all â not all â no they were going to marry their daughterâ â to m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay is it broken off â yesterday morning it appears m_franz_de_quesnel declined the honor â indeed and is the reason known â no â how extraordinary and how does m_noirtier_de_villefort bear it â as usual like a philosopher mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars returned at this moment alone well said the baroness do you leave m_andrea_cavalcanti with your daughter â and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars dâ armilly said the banker do you consider her no one then turning to count_of_monte_cristo he said prince m_andrea_cavalcanti is a charming young man is he not but is he really a prince â i will not answer for it said count_of_monte_cristo his father was introduced to me as a marquis so he ought to be a count but i do not think he has much claim to that title â why said the banker if he is a prince he is wrong not to maintain his rank i do not like anyone to deny his origin â_oh you are a thorough democrat said count_of_monte_cristo smiling but do you see to what you are exposing yourself said the baroness if
perchance de viscount_albert_de_morcerf came he would find m_andrea_cavalcanti in that room where he the betrothed of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars has never been admitted â you may well say perchance replied the banker for he comes so seldom it would seem only chance that brings him â but should he come and find that young man with your daughter he might be displeased â he you are mistaken monsieur_albert would not do us the honor to be jealous he does not like mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars sufficiently besides i care not for his displeasure â still situated as we areâ â â_yes do you know how we are situated at his motherâ ball he danced once with mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and m_andrea_cavalcanti three time and he took no notice of it the valet announced the vicomte monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf the baroness rose hastily and was going into the study when mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars stopped her let her alone said he she looked at him in amazement count_of_monte_cristo appeared to be unconscious of what passed monsieur_albert entered looking very handsome and in high spirits he bowed politely to the baroness familiarly to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and affectionately to count_of_monte_cristo then turning to the baroness may i ask how mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is said he she is quite well replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars quickly she is at the piano with m_andrea_cavalcanti monsieur_albert retained his calm and indifferent manner he might feel perhaps annoyed but he knew monte cristoâ eye was on him m_andrea_cavalcanti has a fine tenor voice said he and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars a splendid soprano and then she plays the piano like thalberg the concert must be a delightful one â they suit each other remarkably well said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars monsieur_albert appeared not to notice this remark which was however so rude that madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars blushed
â i too said the young man am a musicianâ at least my masters used to tell me so but it is strange that my voice never would suit any other and a soprano less than any mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars smiled and seemed to say â_it is of no consequence then hoping doubtless to effect his purpose he said â the prince and my daughter were universally admired yesterday you were not of the party de viscount_albert_de_morcerf â what prince asked monsieur_albert prince m_andrea_cavalcanti said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who persisted in giving the young man that title pardon me said monsieur_albert i was not aware that he was a prince and prince m_andrea_cavalcanti sang with mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars yesterday it must have been charming indeed i regret not having heard them but i was unable to accept your invitation having promised to accompany my mother to a german concert given by the baroness of baron_de_chã_teau_renaud this was followed by rather an awkward silence may i also be allowed said viscount_albert_de_morcerf to pay my respects to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â wait a moment said the banker stopping the young man do you hear that delightful cavatina ta ta ta ti ta ti ta ta it is charming let them finishâ one moment bravo bravi brava the banker was enthusiastic in his applause 40054m indeed said monsieur_albert â_it is exquisite it is impossible to understand the music of his country better than prince m_andrea_cavalcanti does you said prince did you not but he can easily become one if he is not already it is no uncommon thing in italy but to return to the charming musiciansâ you should give us a treat mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars without telling them there is a stranger
ask them to sing one more song it is so delightful to hear music in the distance when the musicians are unrestrained by observation mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was quite annoyed by the young manâ indifference he took count_of_monte_cristo aside what do you think of our lover said he he appears cool but then your word is given â_yes doubtless i have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves her but not to one who does not see him there cold as marble and proud like his father if he were rich if he had cavalcantiâ fortune that might be pardoned ma foi i havenâ consulted my daughter but if she has good tasteâ â â_oh said count_of_monte_cristo my fondness may blind me but i assure you i consider viscount_albert_de_morcerf a charming young man who will render your daughter happy and will sooner or later attain a certain amount of distinction and his fatherâ position is good â hem said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars why do you doubt â the pastâ that obscurity on the past â but that does not affect the son â very true â now i beg of you donâ go off your head itâ a month now that you have been thinking of this marriage and you must see that it throws some responsibility on me for it was at my house_of_peers you met this young m_andrea_cavalcanti whom i do not really know at all â but i do â have you made inquiry â is there any need of that does not his appearance speak for him and he is very rich â i am not so sure of that â and yet you said he had money â fifty thousand livresâ a mere trifle â he is well educated â hem said count_of_monte_cristo in his turn
â he is a musician â so are all italians â come count you do not do that young man justice â well i acknowledge it annoys me knowing your connection with the viscount_albert_de_morcerf family to see him throw himself in the way mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars burst out laughing what a puritan you are said he that happens every day â but you cannot break it off in this way the morcerfs are depending on this union â indeed â positively â then let them explain themselves you should give the father a hint you are so intimate with the family â i where the devil did you find out that â at their ball it was apparent enough why did not the countess the proud mercã_dã_s the disdainful catalane who will scarcely open her lip to her oldest acquaintances take your arm lead you into the garden into the private walks and remain there for half an hour â ah baron baron said monsieur_albert you are not listeningâ what barbarism in a megalomaniac like you â_oh donâ worry about me sir mocker said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars then turning to count_of_monte_cristo he said but will you undertake to speak to the father â willingly if you wish it â but let it be done explicitly and positively if he demands my daughter let him fix the dayâ declare his conditions in short let us either understand each other or quarrel you understandâ no more delay â_yes sir i will give my attention to the subject â i do not say that i await with pleasure his decision but i do await it a banker must you know be a slave to his promise and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars sighed as m_andrea_cavalcanti had done half an hour before bravi bravo brava cried viscount_albert_de_morcerf parodying the banker as the selection came to an end
danglars began to look suspiciously at viscount_albert_de_morcerf when someone came and whispered a few word to him i shall soon return said the banker to count_of_monte_cristo wait for me i shall perhaps have something to say to you and he went out the baroness took advantage of her husbandâ absence to push open the door of her daughterâ study and m_andrea_cavalcanti who was sitting before the piano with mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars started up like a jack in the box monsieur_albert bowed with a smile to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who did not appear in the least disturbed and returned his bow with her usual coolness m_andrea_cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed he bowed to viscount_albert_de_morcerf who replied with the most impertinent look possible then monsieur_albert launched out in praise of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars danglarsâ voice and on his regret after what he had just heard that he had been unable to be present the previous evening m_andrea_cavalcanti being left alone turned to count_of_monte_cristo come said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars leave music and compliments and let us go and take tea â come mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars to her friend they passed into the next drawing room where tea was prepared just as they were beginning in the english fashion to leave the spoons in their cups the door again opened and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars entered visibly agitated count_of_monte_cristo observed it particularly and by a look asked the banker for an explanation i have just received my courier from greece said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars ah yes said the count that was the reason of your running away from us â_yes â how is king otho getting on asked monsieur_albert in the most sprightly tone mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering and count_of_monte_cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which passed over his features but which was gone in a moment
â we shall go together shall we not said monsieur_albert to the count if you like replied the latter monsieur_albert could not understand the bankerâ look and turning to count_of_monte_cristo who understood it perfectly â did you see said he how he looked at me â_yes said the count but did you think there was anything particular in his look â indeed i did and what does he mean by his news from greece â how can i tell you â because i imagine you have correspondents in that country count_of_monte_cristo smiled significantly stop said monsieur_albert here he comes i shall compliment mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars on her cameo while the father talks to you â if you compliment her at all let it be on her voice at least said count_of_monte_cristo no everyone would do that â my dear viscount you are dreadfully impertinent monsieur_albert advanced towards mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars smiling meanwhile mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars stooping to monte cristoâ ear your advice was excellent said he there is a whole history connected with the name m_fernand_mondego and ali_pasha_of_yanina â indeed said count_of_monte_cristo â_yes i will tell you all but take away the young man i cannot endure his presence â he is going with me shall i send the father to you â immediately â very well the count made a sign to monsieur_albert and they bowed to the ladies and took their leave monsieur_albert perfectly indifferent to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars danglarsâ contempt count_of_monte_cristo reiterating his advice to madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars on the prudence a bankerâ wife should exercise in providing for the future m_andrea_cavalcanti remained master of the field chapter 77 haydã_e scarcely had the countâ horse cleared the angle of the boulevard when monsieur_albert turning towards the count burst into a loud fit of laughterâ much too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather forced and unnatural
â well said he i will ask you the same question which charles ix put to catherine deâ medici after the massacre of saint bartholomew how have i played my little part â to what do you allude asked count_of_monte_cristo to the installation of my rival at danglarsâ â what rival â ma foi what rival why your protã gã m_andrea_cavalcanti â ah no joking viscount if you please i do not patronize andreaâ at least not as concerns mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â and you would be to blame for not assisting him if the young man really needed your help in that quarter but happily for me he can dispense with it â what do you think he is paying his addresses â i am certain of it his languishing look and modulated tone when addressing mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars fully proclaim his intentions he aspires to the hand of the proud mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â what does that signify so long as they favor your suit â but it is not the case my dear count on the contrary i am repulsed on all side â what â_it is so indeed mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars scarcely answers me and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars dâ armilly her confidant does not speak to me at all â but the father has the greatest regard possible for you said count_of_monte_cristo he oh no he has plunged a thousand daggers into my heart tragedy weapons i own which instead of wounding sheathe their points in their own handles but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be real and deadly â jealousy indicates affection â true but i am not jealous â he is â of whom of m_lucien_debray â no of you â of me i will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be closed against me â you are mistaken my dear viscount â prove it to me â do
you wish me to do so â_yes â well i am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the comte de viscount_albert_de_morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron â by whom are you charged â by the baron himself â_oh said monsieur_albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable you surely will not do that my dear count â certainly i shall monsieur_albert as i have promised to do it â well said monsieur_albert with a sigh â_it seems you are determined to marry me â i am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody at all events said count_of_monte_cristo but apropos of m_lucien_debray how is it that i have not seen him lately at the baronâ house_of_peers â there has been a misunderstanding â what with the baroness â no with the baron â has he perceived anything â ah that is a good joke â do you think he suspects said count_of_monte_cristo with charming artlessness where have you come from my dear count said monsieur_albert from congo if you will â_it must be farther off than even that â but what do i know of your parisian husbands â_oh my dear count husbands are pretty much the same everywhere an individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole race â but then what can have led to the quarrel between mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and m_lucien_debray they seemed to understand each other so well said count_of_monte_cristo with renewed energy ah now you are trying to penetrate into the mysteries of isis in which i am not initiated when m_andrea_cavalcanti has become one of the family you can ask him that question the carriage stopped here we are said count_of_monte_cristo â_it is only half past ten oâ clock come in â certainly i will â my
carriage shall take you back â no thank you i gave order for my coupã to follow me â there it is then said count_of_monte_cristo as he stepped out of the carriage they both went into the house_of_peers the drawing room was lighted upâ they went in there you will make tea for us monsieur_baptistin said the count monsieur_baptistin left the room without waiting to answer and in two seconds reappeared bringing on a tray all that his master had ordered ready prepared and appearing to have sprung from the ground like the repasts which we read of in fairy tales really my dear count said viscount_albert_de_morcerf what i admire in you is not so much your riches for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself nor is it only your wit for beaumarchais might have possessed as much but it is your manner of being served without any questions in a moment in a second it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of ringing and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness â what you say is perhaps true they know my habits for instance you shall see how do you wish to occupy yourself during tea time â ma foi i should like to smoke count_of_monte_cristo took the gong and struck it once in about the space of a second a private door opened and ali_pasha_of_yanina appeared bringing two chibouques filled with excellent latakia â_it is quite wonderful said monsieur_albert â_oh no it is as simple as possible replied count_of_monte_cristo
â ali_pasha_of_yanina knows i generally smoke while i am taking my tea or coffee he has heard that i ordered tea and he also knows that i brought you home with me when i summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in company and therefore brings two chibouques instead of oneâ and now the mystery is solved â certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation but it is not the less true that youâ ah but what do i hear and viscount_albert_de_morcerf inclined his head towards the door through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a guitar ma foi my dear viscount you are fated to hear music this evening you have only escaped from mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars danglarsâ piano to be attacked by haydã eâ guzla â haydã eâ what an adorable name are there then really woman who bear the name of haydã_e anywhere but in byronâ poems â certainly there are haydã_e is a very uncommon name in france but is common enough in albania and epirus it is as if you said for example chastity modesty innocence â_it is a kind of baptismal name as you parisians call it â_oh that is charming said monsieur_albert how i should like to hear my countrywomen called mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars goodness mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars silence mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars christian charity only think then if mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars instead of being called claire marie mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had been named mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars chastity modesty innocence mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars what a fine effect that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage â hush said the count do not joke in so loud a tone haydã_e may hear you perhaps â and
you think she would be angry â no certainly not said the count with a haughty expression she is very amiable then is she not said monsieur_albert â_it is not to be called amiability it is her duty a slave does not dictate to a master â come you are joking yourself now are there any more slaves to be had who bear this beautiful name â undoubtedly â really count you do nothing and have nothing like other people the slave of the count_of_monte_cristo why it is a rank of itself in france and from the way in which you lavish money it is a place that must be worth a hundred thousand franc a year â a hundred thousand franc the poor girl originally possessed much more than that she was born to treasures in comparison with which those recorded in the thousand and one night would seem but poverty â she must be a princess then â you are right and she is one of the greatest in her country too â i thought so but how did it happen that such a great princess became a slave â how was it that dionysius the tyrant became a schoolmaster the fortune of war my dear viscount the caprice of fortune that is the way in which these thing are to be accounted for â and is her name a secret â as regards the generality of mankind it is but not for you my dear viscount who are one of my most intimate friend and on whose silence i feel i may rely if i consider it necessary to enjoin itâ may i not do so â certainly on my word of honor â you know the history of the ali_pasha_of_yanina do you not â of ali_pasha_of_yanina tepelini 13
oh yes it was in his service that my father made his fortune â true i had forgotten that 40062m well what is haydã_e to ali_pasha_of_yanina tepelini â merely his daughter â what the daughter of ali_pasha_of_yanina â of ali_pasha_of_yanina and the beautiful vasiliki â and your slave â ma foi yes â but how did she become so â why simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day as i was passing through the market at constantinople â wonderful really my dear count you seem to throw a sort of magic influence over all in which you are concerned when i listen to you existence no longer seems reality but a waking dream now i am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request butâ â say on â but since you go out with haydã_e and sometimes even take her to the operaâ â well â i think i may venture to ask you this favor â you may venture to ask me anything â well then my dear count present me to your princess â i will do so but on two conditions â i accept them at once â the first is that you will never tell anyone that i have granted the interview â very well said monsieur_albert extending his hand i swear i will not â the second is that you will not tell her that your father ever served hers â i give you my oath that i will not â enough viscount you will remember those two vows will you not but i know you to be a man of honor the count again struck the gong ali_pasha_of_yanina reappeared tell haydã_e said he that i will take coffee with her and give her to understand that i desire permission to present one of my friend to her ali_pasha_of_yanina bowed and left the room
â now understand me said the count no direct questions my dear viscount_albert_de_morcerf if you wish to know anything tell me and i will ask her â agreed ali_pasha_of_yanina reappeared for the third time and drew back the tapestried hanging which concealed the door to signify to his master and monsieur_albert that they were at liberty to pass on let us go in said count_of_monte_cristo monsieur_albert passed his hand through his hair and curled his moustache then having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance followed the count into the room the latter having previously resumed his hat and gloves ali_pasha_of_yanina was stationed as a kind of advanced guard and the door was kept by the three french attendants commanded by myrtho haydã_e was awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments which was the drawing room her large eye were dilated with surprise and expectation for it was the first time that any man except count_of_monte_cristo had been accorded an entrance into her presence she was sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room with her legs crossed under her in the eastern fashion and seemed to have made for herself as it were a kind of nest in the rich indian silks which enveloped her near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing it was elegantly fashioned and worthy of its mistress on perceiving count_of_monte_cristo she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself expressive at once of the most implicit obedience and also of the deepest love count_of_monte_cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand which she as usual raised to her lip 40064
m monsieur_albert had proceeded no farther than the door where he remained rooted to the spot being completely fascinated by the sight of such surpassing beauty beheld as it was for the first time and of which an inhabitant of more northern climes could form no adequate idea whom do you bring asked the young girl in romaic of count_of_monte_cristo is it a friend a brother a simple acquaintance or an enemy â a friend said count_of_monte_cristo in the same language what is his name â count monsieur_albert it is the same man whom i rescued from the hand of the banditti at rome â in what language would you like me to converse with him count_of_monte_cristo turned to monsieur_albert do you know modern greek asked he alas no said monsieur_albert nor even ancient greek my dear count never had homer or plato a more unworthy scholar than myself â then said haydã_e proving by her remark that she had quite understood monte cristoâ question and albertâ answer then i will speak either in french or italian if my lord so wills it count_of_monte_cristo reflected one instant you will speak in italian said he then turning towards monsieur_albert â_it is a pity you do not understand either ancient or modern greek both of which haydã_e speaks so fluently the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in italian which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation the count made a sign to haydã_e to address his visitor sir she said to viscount_albert_de_morcerf you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master this was said in excellent tuscan and with that soft roman accent which makes the language of dante as sonorous as that of homer
then turning to ali_pasha_of_yanina she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had left the room to execute the order of his young mistress she beckoned monsieur_albert to approach nearer to her count_of_monte_cristo and viscount_albert_de_morcerf drew their seats towards a small table on which were arranged music drawings and vases of flowers ali_pasha_of_yanina then entered bringing coffee and chibouques as to monsieur_baptistin this portion of the building was interdicted to him monsieur_albert refused the pipe which the nubian offered him â_oh take itâ take it said the count haydã_e is almost as civilized as a parisian the smell of a havana is disagreeable to her but the tobacco of the east is a most delicious perfume you know ali_pasha_of_yanina left the room the cups of coffee were all prepared with the addition of sugar which had been brought for monsieur_albert count_of_monte_cristo and haydã_e took the beverage in the original arabian manner that is to say without sugar haydã_e took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a child when eating or drinking something which it likes at this moment two woman entered bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet which they placed on two small tables appropriated to that purpose my dear host and you signora said monsieur_albert in italian excuse my apparent stupidity i am quite bewildered and it is natural that it should be so
here i am in the heart of paris but a moment ago i heard the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the lemonade sellers and now i feel as if i were suddenly transported to the east not such as i have seen it but such as my dreams have painted it oh signora if i could but speak greek your conversation added to the fairy scene which surrounds me would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget â i speak sufficient italian to enable me to converse with you sir said haydã_e quietly and if you like what is eastern i will do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here â on what subject shall i converse with her said monsieur_albert in a low tone to count_of_monte_cristo just what you please you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences or if you like it better you can talk of rome naples or florence â_oh said monsieur_albert â_it is of no use to be in the company of a greek if one converses just in the same style as with a parisian let me speak to her of the east â do so then for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her taste monsieur_albert turned towards haydã_e at what age did you leave greece signora asked he i left it when i was but five year old replied haydã_e and have you any recollection of your country â when i shut my eye and think i seem to see it all again the mind can see as well as the body the body forgets sometimes but the mind always remembers â and
how far back into the past do your recollections extend â i could scarcely walk when my mother who was called vasiliki which means royal said the young girl tossing her head proudly took me by the hand and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed we went out both covered with veils to solicit alms for the prisoners saying he who giveth to the poor lendeth to the lord then when our purse was full we returned to the palace and without saying a word to my father we sent it to the convent where it was divided amongst the prisoners â and how old were you at that time â i was three year old said haydã_e then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when you were three year old said monsieur_albert everything â count said monsieur_albert in a low tone to count_of_monte_cristo do allow the signora to tell me something of her history you prohibited my mentioning my fatherâ name to her but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital and you have no idea how delighted i should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful lip count_of_monte_cristo turned to haydã_e and with an expression of countenance which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his word he said in greek î ï á½ î¼á½²î½ á¼ î î½ î¼á½µî îµ á½ á½ î½î î¼î ï î á½¹ï ï îºî á½ ï î ï á½ î½ îµá¼ á½² á¼ î¼á î½ â that is tell us the fate of your father but neither the name of the traitor nor the treason haydã_e sighed deeply and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow what are you saying to her said viscount_albert_de_morcerf in an undertone
â i again reminded her that you were a friend and that she need not conceal anything from you â then said monsieur_albert this pious pilgrimage in behalf of the prisoners was your first remembrance what is the next â_oh then i remember as if it were but yesterday sitting under the shade of some sycamore trees on the borders of a lake in the waters of which the trembling foliage was reflected as in a mirror under the oldest and thickest of these trees reclining on cushions sat my father my mother was at his foot and i childlike amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle or with the diamond hilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle then from time to time there came to him an albanian who said something to which i paid no attention but which he always answered in the same tone of voice either kill or pardon â â_it is very strange said monsieur_albert to hear such word proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage and one needs constantly to be saying to oneâ self this is no fiction it is all reality in order to believe it and how does france appear in your eye accustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes â i think it is a fine country said haydã_e but i see france as it really is because i look on it with the eye of a woman whereas my own country which i can only judge of from the impression produced on my childish mind always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere which is luminous or otherwise according as my remembrances of it are sad or joyous â so
young said monsieur_albert forgetting at the moment the countâ command that he should ask no questions of the slave herself is it possible that you can have known what suffering is except by name haydã_e turned her eye towards count_of_monte_cristo who making at the same time some imperceptible sign murmured î á¼ á½³â speak â nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood and with the exception of the two scenes i have just described to you all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest sadness 40068m speak speak signora said monsieur_albert i am listening with the most intense delight and interest to all you say haydã_e answered his remark with a melancholy smile you wish me then to relate the history of my past sorrows said she i beg you to do so replied monsieur_albert well i was but four year old when one night i was suddenly awakened by my mother we were in the palace of ali_pasha_of_yanina she snatched me from the cushions on which i was sleeping and on opening my eye i saw hers filled with tears she took me away without speaking when i saw her weeping i began to cry too hush child said she at other time in spite of maternal endearments or threats i had with a childâ caprice been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as much as i felt inclined but on this occasion there was an intonation of such extreme terror in my motherâ voice when she enjoined me to silence that i ceased crying as soon as her command was given she bore me rapidly away
â i saw then that we were descending a large staircase around us were all my motherâ servant carrying trunks bags ornaments jewels purses of gold with which they were hurrying away in the greatest distraction behind the woman came a guard of twenty man armed with long guns and pistols and dressed in the costume which the greeks have assumed since they have again become a nation you may imagine there was something startling and ominous said haydã_e shaking her head and turning pale at the mere remembrance of the scene in this long file of slaves and woman only half aroused from sleep or at least so they appeared to me who was myself scarcely awake here and there on the wall of the staircase were reflected gigantic shadows which trembled in the flickering light of the pine torches till they seemed to reach to the vaulted roof above â quick said a voice at the end of the gallery this voice made everyone bow before it resembling in its effect the wind passing over a field of wheat by its superior strength forcing every ear to yield obeisance as for me it made me tremble this voice was that of my father he came last clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his hand the carbine which your emperor presented him he was leaning on the shoulder of his favorite selim and he drove us all before him as a shepherd would his straggling flock
my father said haydã_e raising her head was that illustrious man known in europe under the name of ali_pasha_of_yanina tepelini ali_pasha_of_yanina and before whom turkey trembled monsieur_albert without knowing why started on hearing these word pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent it appeared to him as if there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed from the brilliant eye of haydã_e at this moment she appeared like a pythoness evoking a spectre as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man to the news of which all europe had listened with horror soon said haydã_e we halted on our march and found ourselves on the borders of a lake my mother pressed me to her throbbing heart and at the distance of a few paces i saw my father who was glancing anxiously around four marble step led down to the waterâ edge and below them was a boat floating on the tide 40070m from where we stood i could see in the middle of the lake a large blank mass it was the kiosk to which we were going this kiosk appeared to me to be at a considerable distance perhaps on account of the darkness of the night which prevented any object from being more than partially discerned we stepped into the boat i remember well that the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water and when i leaned over to ascertain the cause i saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our palikares 14 besides the rowers the boat contained only the woman my father mother selim and myself
the palikares had remained on the shore of the lake ready to cover our retreat they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble step and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three others in case of pursuit our bark flew before the wind why does the boat go so fast asked i of my mother â silence child hush we are flying i did not understand why should my father fly he the all powerfulâ he before whom others were accustomed to flyâ he who had taken for his device they hate me then they fear me â_it was indeed a flight which my father was trying to effect i have been told since that the garrison of the castle of ali_pasha_of_yanina fatigued with long serviceâ â here haydã_e cast a significant glance at count_of_monte_cristo whose eye had been riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her narrative the young girl then continued speaking slowly like a person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is relating you were saying signora said monsieur_albert who was paying the most implicit attention to the recital that the garrison of ali_pasha_of_yanina fatigued with long serviceâ â had treated with the seraskier15 kourchid who had been sent by the sultan to gain possession of the person of my father it was then that ali_pasha_of_yanina tepeliniâ after having sent to the sultan a french officer in whom he reposed great confidenceâ resolved to retire to the asylum which he had long before prepared for himself and which he called kataphygion or the refuge â and this officer asked monsieur_albert do you remember his name signora count_of_monte_cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl which was quite unperceived by monsieur_albert
â no said she i do not remember it just at this moment but if it should occur to me presently i will tell you monsieur_albert was on the point of pronouncing his fatherâ name when count_of_monte_cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach the young man recollected his promise and was silent â_it was towards this kiosk that we were rowing a ground floor ornamented with arabesques bathing its terraces in the water and another floor looking on the lake was all which was visible to the eye but beneath the ground floor stretching out into the island was a large subterranean cavern to which my mother myself and the woman were conducted in this place were together 60 000 pouches and 200 barrels the pouches contained 25 000 000 of money in gold and the barrels were filled with 30 000 pounds of gunpowder near the barrels stood selim my fatherâ favorite whom i mentioned to you just now he stood watch day and night with a lance provided with a lighted slowmatch in his hand and he had order to blow up everythingâ kiosk guards woman gold and ali_pasha_of_yanina tepelini himselfâ at the first signal given by my father i remember well that the slaves convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their life passed whole day and night in praying crying and groaning as for me i can never forget the pale complexion and black eye of the young soldier and whenever the angel of death summons me to another world i am quite sure i shall recognize selim i cannot tell you how long we remained in this state at that period i did not even know what time meant
sometimes but very rarely my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace these were hour of recreation for me as i never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and selimâ fiery lance my father was endeavoring to pierce with his eager look the remotest verge of the horizon examining attentively every black speck which appeared on the lake while my mother reclining by his side rested her head on his shoulder and i played at his foot admiring everything i saw with that unsophisticated innocence of childhood which throws a charm round objects insignificant in themselves but which in its eye are invested with the greatest importance the heights of pindus towered above us the castle of ali_pasha_of_yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake and the immense masses of black vegetation which viewed in the distance gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks were in reality gigantic fir trees and myrtles one morning my father sent for us my mother had been crying all the night and was very wretched we found the pasha calm but paler than usual take courage vasiliki said he today arrives the firman of the master and my fate will be decided if my pardon be complete we shall return triumphant to ali_pasha_of_yanina if the news be inauspicious we must fly this night â but supposing our enemy should not allow us to do so said my mother â_oh make yourself easy on that head said ali_pasha_of_yanina smiling selim and his flaming lance will settle that matter they would be glad to see me dead but they would not like themselves to die with me â my
mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did not come from my fatherâ heart she prepared the iced water which he was in the habit of constantly drinking for since his sojourn at the kiosk he had been parched by the most violent fever after which she anointed his white beard with perfumed oil and lighted his chibouque which he sometimes smoked for hour together quietly watching the wreaths of vapor that ascended in spiral clouds and gradually melted away in the surrounding atmosphere presently he made such a sudden movement that i was paralyzed with fear then without taking his eye from the object which had first attracted his attention he asked for his telescope my mother gave it him and as she did so looked whiter than the marble against which she leaned i saw my fatherâ hand tremble a boat two three murmured my father â four he then arose seizing his arm and priming his pistols vasiliki said he to my mother trembling perceptibly the instant approaches which will decide everything in the space of half an hour we shall know the emperorâ answer go into the cavern with haydã_e â i will not quit you said vasiliki if you die my lord i will die with you â go to selim cried my father adieu my lord murmured my mother determining quietly to await the approach of death take away vasiliki said my father to his palikares as for me i had been forgotten in the general confusion i ran toward ali_pasha_of_yanina tepelini he saw me hold out my arm to him and he stooped down and pressed my forehead with his lip oh how distinctly i remember that kiss â_it was the last he ever gave me and i feel as if it were still warm on my forehead
on descending we saw through the lattice work several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view at first they appeared like black specks and now they looked like birds skimming the surface of the waves during this time in the kiosk at my fatherâ foot were seated twenty palikares concealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager eye the arrival of the boats they were armed with their long guns inlaid with mother of pearl and silver and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the floor my father looked at his watch and paced up and down with a countenance expressive of the greatest anguish this was the scene which presented itself to my view as i quitted my father after that last kiss my mother and i traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern selim was still at his post and smiled sadly on us as we entered we fetched our cushions from the other end of the cavern and sat down by selim in great dangers the devoted one cling to each other and young as i was i quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over our head monsieur_albert had often heardâ not from his father for he never spoke on the subject but from strangersâ the description of the last moment of the vizier of ali_pasha_of_yanina he had read different accounts of his death but the story seemed to acquire fresh meaning from the voice and expression of the young girl and her sympathetic accent and the melancholy expression of her countenance at once charmed and horrified him
as to haydã_e these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment for she ceased speaking her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm and her eye gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the pindus and the blue waters of the lake of ali_pasha_of_yanina which like a magic mirror seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched count_of_monte_cristo looked at her with an indescribable expression of interest and pity go on my child said the count in the romaic language 40074 haydã_e looked up abruptly as if the sonorous tone of monte cristoâ voice had awakened her from a dream and she resumed her narrative â_it was about four oâ clock in the afternoon and although the day was brilliant out of door we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the cavern one single solitary light was burning there and it appeared like a star set in a heaven of blackness it was selimâ flaming lance my mother was a christian and she prayed selim repeated from time to time the sacred word god is great however my mother had still some hope as she was coming down she thought she recognized the french officer who had been sent to constantinople and in whom my father placed so much confidence for he knew that all the soldiers of the french emperor were naturally noble and generous she advanced some step towards the staircase and listened they are approaching said she perhaps they bring us peace and liberty â what do you fear vasiliki said selim in a voice at once so gentle and yet so proud
â if they do not bring us peace we will give them war if they do not bring life we will give them death and he renewed the flame of his lance with a gesture which made one think of dionysus of old crete 16 but i being only a little child was terrified by this undaunted courage which appeared to me both ferocious and senseless and i recoiled with horror from the idea of the frightful death amidst fire and flames which probably awaited us my mother experienced the same sensations for i felt her tremble mamma mamma said i are we really to be killed and at the sound of my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers and lamentations my child said vasiliki may god preserve you from ever wishing for that death which today you so much dread then whispering to selim she asked what were her masterâ order if he send me his poniard it will signify that the emperorâ intentions are not favorable and i am to set fire to the powder if on the contrary he send me his ring it will be a sign that the emperor pardons him and i am to extinguish the match and leave the magazine untouched â my friend said my mother when your masterâ order arrive if it is the poniard which he sends instead of despatching us by that horrible death which we both so much dread you will mercifully kill us with this same poniard will you not â â_yes vasiliki replied selim tranquilly suddenly we heard loud cries and listening discerned that they were cries of joy
the name of the french officer who had been sent to constantinople resounded on all side amongst our palikares it was evident that he brought the answer of the emperor and that it was favorable â and do you not remember the frenchmanâ name said viscount_albert_de_morcerf quite ready to aid the memory of the narrator count_of_monte_cristo made a sign to him to be silent i do not recollect it said haydã_e the noise increased step were heard approaching nearer and nearer they were descending the step leading to the cavern selim made ready his lance soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy retreat who are you cried selim but whoever you may be i charge you not to advance another step â long live the emperor said the figure he grants a full pardon to the vizier ali_pasha_of_yanina and not only gives him his life but restores to him his fortune and his possessions my mother uttered a cry of joy and clasped me to her bosom stop said selim seeing that she was about to go out you see i have not yet received the ring â true said my mother and she fell on her knees at the same time holding me up towards heaven as if she desired while praying to god in my behalf to raise me actually to his presence and for the second time haydã_e stopped overcome by such violent emotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow and her stifled voice seemed hardly able to find utterance so parched and dry were her throat and lip
40076m count_of_monte_cristo poured a little iced water into a glass and presented it to her saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of command â courage haydã_e dried her eye and continued by this time our eye habituated to the darkness had recognized the messenger of the pasha â_it was a friend selim had also recognized him but the brave young man only acknowledged one duty which was to obey in whose name do you come said he to him i come in the name of our master ali_pasha_of_yanina tepelini â if you come from ali_pasha_of_yanina himself said selim you know what you were charged to remit to me â â_yes said the messenger and i bring you his ring at these word he raised his hand above his head to show the token but it was too far off and there was not light enough to enable selim where he was standing to distinguish and recognize the object presented to his view i do not see what you have in your hand said selim approach then said the messenger or i will come nearer to you if you prefer it â i will agree to neither one nor the other replied the young soldier place the object which i desire to see in the ray of light which shines there and retire while i examine it â be it so said the envoy and he retired after having first deposited the token agreed on in the place pointed out to him by selim â_oh how our heart palpitated for it did indeed seem to be a ring which was placed there but was it my fatherâ ring that was the question
selim still holding in his hand the lighted match walked towards the opening in the cavern and aided by the faint light which streamed in through the mouth of the cave picked up the token â_it is well said he kissing it â_it is my masterâ ring and throwing the match on the ground he trampled on it and extinguished it the messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hand at this signal four soldiers of the seraskier kourchid suddenly appeared and selim fell pierced by five blows each man had stabbed him separately and intoxicated by their crime though still pale with fear they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold at this moment my mother seized me in her arm and hurrying noiselessly along numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves she arrived at a private staircase of the kiosk where was a scene of frightful tumult and confusion the lower room were entirely filled with kourchidâ troops that is to say with our enemies just as my mother was on the point of pushing open a small door we heard the voice of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening tone my mother applied her eye to the crack between the boards i luckily found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing within what do you want said my father to some people who were holding a paper inscribed with characters of gold what we want replied one is to communicate to you the will of his highness do you see this firman â i do said my father
â well read it he demands your head 40078m my father answered with a loud laugh which was more frightful than even threats would have been and he had not ceased when two reports of a pistol were heard he had fired them himself and had killed two man the palikares who were prostrated at my fatherâ foot now sprang up and fired and the room was filled with fire and smoke at the same instant the firing began on the other side and the balls penetrated the boards all round us oh how noble did the grand vizier my father look at that moment in the midst of the flying bullets his scimitar in his hand and his face blackened with the powder of his enemies and how he terrified them even then and made them fly before him selim selim cried he guardian of the fire do your duty â selim is dead replied a voice which seemed to come from the depths of the earth and you are lost ali_pasha_of_yanina at the same moment an explosion was heard and the flooring of the room in which my father was sitting was suddenly torn up and shivered to atomsâ the troops were firing from underneath three or four palikares fell with their bodies literally ploughed with wounds my father howled aloud plunged his fingers into the holes which the balls had made and tore up one of the planks entire but immediately through this opening twenty more shots were fired and the flame rushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano soon reached the tapestry which it quickly devoured in the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries two reports fearfully distinct followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all froze me with terror
these two shots had mortally wounded my father and it was he who had given utterance to these frightful cries however he remained standing clinging to a window my mother tried to force the door that she might go and die with him but it was fastened on the inside all around him were lying the palikares writhing in convulsive agonies while two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to escape by springing from the window at this crisis the whole flooring suddenly gave way my father fell on one knee and at the same moment twenty hand were thrust forth armed with sabres pistols and poniardsâ twenty blows were instantaneously directed against one man and my father disappeared in a whirlwind of fire and smoke kindled by these demons and which seemed like hell itself opening beneath his foot i felt myself fall to the ground my mother had fainted haydã eâ arm fell by her side and she uttered a deep groan at the same time looking towards the count as if to ask if he were satisfied with her obedience to his commands count_of_monte_cristo arose and approached her took her hand and said to her in romaic calm yourself my dear child and take courage in remembering that there is a god who will punish traitors â_it is a frightful story count said monsieur_albert terrified at the paleness of haydã eâ countenance and i reproach myself now for having been so cruel and thoughtless in my request â_oh it is nothing said count_of_monte_cristo then patting the young girl on the head he continued haydã_e is very courageous and she sometimes even finds consolation in the recital of her misfortunes â because my lord said haydã e
eagerly my miseries recall to me the remembrance of your goodness monsieur_albert looked at her with curiosity for she had not yet related what he most desired to know how she had become the slave of the count haydã_e saw at a glance the same expression pervading the countenances of her two auditors she continued when my mother recovered her senses we were before the seraskier kill said she but spare the honor of the widow of ali_pasha_of_yanina â â_it is not to me to whom you must address yourself said kourchid â to whom then â to your new master â who and where is he â he is here â and kourchid pointed out one who had more than any contributed to the death of my father said haydã_e in a tone of chastened anger then said monsieur_albert you became the property of this man 40080m no replied haydã_e he did not dare to keep us so we were sold to some slave merchants who were going to constantinople we traversed greece and arrived half dead at the imperial gates they were surrounded by a crowd of people who opened a way for us to pass when suddenly my mother having looked closely at an object which was attracting their attention uttered a piercing cry and fell to the ground pointing as she did so to a head which was placed over the gates and beneath which were inscribed these word this is the head of ali_pasha_of_yanina tepelini ali_pasha_of_yanina â i cried bitterly and tried to raise my mother from the earth but she was dead i was taken to the slave market and was purchased by a rich armenian
he caused me to be instructed gave me masters and when i was thirteen year of age he sold me to the sultan mahmoud â of whom i bought her said count_of_monte_cristo as i told you monsieur_albert with the emerald which formed a match to the one i had made into a box for the purpose of holding my hashish pills â_oh you are good you are great my lord said haydã_e kissing the countâ hand and i am very fortunate in belonging to such a master monsieur_albert remained quite bewildered with all that he had seen and heard come finish your cup of coffee said count_of_monte_cristo the history is ended chapter 78 we hear from ali_pasha_of_yanina if mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort could have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance of m_franz_de_quesnel when he quitted the chamber of m_noirtier_de_villefort even she would have been constrained to pity him m_noirtier_de_villefort had only just given utterance to a few incoherent sentences and then retired to his study where he received about two hour afterwards the following letter after all the disclosures which were made this morning m_noirtier_de_villefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed between his family and that of m_franz_de_quesnel dâ pinay dâ pinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that m_noirtier_de_villefort who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning should not have anticipated him in this announcement no one who had seen the magistrate at this moment so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor or rather rudeness so far as to relate such a history
and in justice to m_noirtier_de_villefort it must be understood that m_noirtier_de_villefort who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject had always omitted to explain the affair to m_noirtier_de_villefort so that he had all his life entertained the belief that general m_franz_de_quesnel or the baron dâ pinay as he was alternately styled according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name or by the title which had been conferred on him fell the victim of assassination and not that he was killed fairly in a duel this harsh letter coming as it did from a man generally so polite and respectful struck a mortal blow at the pride of m_noirtier_de_villefort hardly had he read the letter when his wife entered the sudden departure of m_franz_de_quesnel after being summoned by m_noirtier_de_villefort had so much astonished everyone that the position of madame m_noirtier_de_villefort left alone with the notary and the witnesses became every moment more embarrassing determined to bear it no longer she arose and left the room saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden disappearance de villefortâ communications on the subject were very limited and concise he told her in fact that an explanation had taken place between m_noirtier_de_villefort dâ pinay and himself and that the marriage of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and m_franz_de_quesnel would consequently be broken off this was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting she therefore contented herself with saying that m_noirtier_de_villefort having at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of apoplectic fit the affair would necessarily be deferred for some day longer
this news false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred evidently astonished the auditors and they retired without a word during this time mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort at once terrified and happy after having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable asked leave to retire to her own room in order to recover her composure m_noirtier_de_villefort looked the permission which she solicited but instead of going to her own room mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort having once gained her liberty entered the gallery and opening a small door at the end of it found herself at once in the garden in the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of valentineâ mind she expected every moment that she should see m_maximilian_morrel appear pale and trembling to forbid the signing of the contract like the laird of ravenswood in the bride of lammermoor it was high time for her to make her appearance at the gate for m_maximilian_morrel had long awaited her coming he had half guessed what was going on when he saw m_franz_de_quesnel quit the cemetery with m_noirtier_de_villefort he followed dâ pinay saw him enter afterwards go out and then re enter with monsieur_albert and baron_de_chã_teau_renaud he had no longer any doubts as to the nature of the conference he therefore quickly went to the gate in the clover patch prepared to hear the result of the proceedings and very certain that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort would hasten to him the first moment she should be set at liberty
he was not mistaken peering through the crevices of the wooden partition he soon discovered the young girl who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier the first glance which m_maximilian_morrel directed towards her entirely reassured him and the first word she spoke made his heart bound with delight we are saved said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort saved repeated m_maximilian_morrel not being able to conceive such intense happiness by whom â by my grandfather oh m_maximilian_morrel pray love him for all his goodness to us m_maximilian_morrel swore to love him with all his soul and at that moment he could safely promise to do so for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as a friend or even as a father he worshiped him as a god but tell me mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort how has it all been effected what strange means has he used to compass this blessed end mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort was on the point of relating all that had passed but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather and she said at some future time i will tell you all about it â but when will that be â when i am your wife the conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to m_maximilian_morrel that he was ready to accede to anything that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort thought fit to propose and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day however he would not leave without the promise of seeing mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort again the next night
valentine promised all that m_maximilian_morrel required of her and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry m_maximilian_morrel than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry m_franz_de_quesnel during the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed madame m_noirtier_de_villefort had gone to visit m_noirtier_de_villefort the old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive her sir said she â_it is superfluous for me to tell you that valentineâ marriage is broken off since it was here that the affair was concluded noirtierâ countenance remained immovable but one thing i can tell you of which i do not think you are aware that is that i have always been opposed to this marriage and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation m_noirtier_de_villefort regarded his daughter in law with the look of a man desiring an explanation now that this marriage which i know you so much disliked is done away with i come to you on an errand which neither m_noirtier_de_villefort nor mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort could consistently undertake noirtierâ eye demanded the nature of her mission i come to entreat you sir continued madame m_noirtier_de_villefort as the only one who has the right of doing so inasmuch as i am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transaction i come to entreat you to restore not your love for that she has always possessed but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter there was a doubtful expression in noirtierâ eye he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing so may
i hope sir said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort that your intentions accord with my request m_noirtier_de_villefort made a sign that they did in that case sir rejoined madame m_noirtier_de_villefort i will leave you overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your prompt acquiescence to my wishes she then bowed to m_noirtier_de_villefort and retired the next day m_noirtier_de_villefort sent for the notary the first will was torn up and a second made in which he left the whole of his fortune to mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort on condition that she should never be separated from him it was then generally reported that mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort the heiress of the marquis and marchioness of madame_de_saint_mã_ran had regained the good graces of her grandfather and that she would ultimately be in possession of an income of 300 000 livres while all the proceedings relative to the dissolution of the marriage contract were being carried on at the house_of_peers of m_noirtier_de_villefort count_of_monte_cristo had paid his visit to the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf who in order to lose no time in responding to danglarsâ wishes and at the same time to pay all due deference to his position in society donned his uniform of lieutenant general which he ornamented with all his crosses and thus attired ordered his finest horse and drove to the rue de la chaussã dâ antin mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was balancing his monthly accounts and it was perhaps not the most favorable moment for finding him in his best humor at the first sight of his old friend mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars assumed his majestic air and settled himself in his easy chair
morcerf usually so stiff and formal accosted the banker in an affable and smiling manner and feeling sure that the overture he was about to make would be well received he did not consider it necessary to adopt any manå uvres in order to gain his end but went at once straight to the point 40086 â well baron said he here i am at last some time has elapsed since our plans were formed and they are not yet executed viscount_albert_de_morcerf paused at these word quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which had gathered on the brow of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and which he attributed to his silence but on the contrary to his great surprise it grew darker and darker to what do you allude monsieur_albert said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the generalâ word ah said viscount_albert_de_morcerf i see you are a stickler for forms my dear sir and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted ma foi i beg your pardon but as i have but one son and it is the first time i have ever thought of marrying him i am still serving my apprenticeship you know come i will reform
and viscount_albert_de_morcerf with a forced smile arose and making a low bow to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars said baron i have the honor of asking of you the hand of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars for my son the vicomte monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf but mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which viscount_albert_de_morcerf had expected knit his brow and without inviting the count who was still standing to take a seat he said monsieur_albert it will be necessary to reflect before i give you an answer â to reflect said viscount_albert_de_morcerf more and more astonished have you not had enough time for reflection during the eight year which have elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us â count said the banker thing are constantly occurring in the world to induce us to lay aside our most established opinions or at all events to cause us to remodel them according to the change of circumstances which may have placed affairs in a totally different light to that in which we at first viewed them â i do not understand you baron said viscount_albert_de_morcerf what i mean to say is this sir
â that during the last fortnight unforeseen circumstances have occurredâ â excuse me said viscount_albert_de_morcerf but is it a play we are acting â a play â_yes for it is like one pray let us come more to the point and endeavor thoroughly to understand each other â that is quite my desire â you have seen de count_of_monte_cristo have you not â i see him very often said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars drawing himself up he is a particular friend of mine â well in one of your late conversations with him you said that i appeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage did you not â i did say so â well here i am proving at once that i am really neither the one nor the other by entreating you to keep your promise on that score mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars did not answer have
you so soon changed your mind added viscount_albert_de_morcerf or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage turned to viscount_albert_de_morcerf and said count you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve and i assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you but believe me when i say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me â these are all so many empty word my dear sir said viscount_albert_de_morcerf they might satisfy a new acquaintance but the comte de viscount_albert_de_morcerf does not rank in that list and when a man like him comes to another recalls to him his plighted word and this man fails to redeem the pledge he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was a coward but did not wish to appear so he was piqued at the tone which viscount_albert_de_morcerf had just assumed i am not without a good reason for my conduct replied the banker what do you mean to say â i mean to say that i have a good reason but that it is difficult to explain â you must be aware at all events that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me but one thing at least is clear which is that you decline allying yourself with my family â no sir said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i merely suspend my decision that is all â and
do you really flatter yourself that i shall yield to all your caprices and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces â then count if you will not wait we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained the count bit his lip till the blood almost started to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain understanding however that in the present state of thing the laugh would decidedly be against him he turned from the door towards which he had been directing his step and again confronted the banker a cloud settled on his brow evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there my dear mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars said viscount_albert_de_morcerf we have been acquainted for many year and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each otherâ failings you owe me an explanation and really it is but fair that i should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your favor â_it is from no personal ill feeling towards the viscount that is all i can say sir replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that viscount_albert_de_morcerf was a little softened and calmed down and towards whom do you bear this personal ill feeling then said viscount_albert_de_morcerf turning pale with anger the expression of the countâ face had not remained unperceived by the banker he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before and said you may perhaps be better satisfied that i should not go farther into particulars
a tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count and making a violent effort over himself he said i have a right to insist on your giving me an explanation is it madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf who has displeased you is it my fortune which you find insufficient is it because my opinions differ from yours â nothing of the kind sir replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars if such had been the case i only should have been to blame inasmuch as i was aware of all these thing when i made the engagement no do not seek any longer to discover the reason i really am quite ashamed to have been the cause of your undergoing such severe self examination let us drop the subject and adopt the middle course of delay which implies neither a rupture nor an engagement ma foi there is no hurry my daughter is only seventeen year old and your son twenty one while we wait time will be progressing events will succeed each other thing which in the evening look dark and obscure appear but too clearly in the light of morning and sometimes the utterance of one word or the lapse of a single day will reveal the most cruel calumnies â calumnies did you say sir cried viscount_albert_de_morcerf turning livid with rage does anyone dare to slander me â monsieur_albert i told you that i considered it best to avoid all explanation â then sir i am patiently to submit to your refusal â_yes sir although i assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive for i had reckoned on the honor of your alliance and the breaking off of a marriage contract always injures the lady more than the gentleman â enough
sir said viscount_albert_de_morcerf we will speak no more on the subject and clutching his gloves in anger he left the apartment mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars observed that during the whole conversation viscount_albert_de_morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars recalled his word that evening he had a long conference with several friend and m_andrea_cavalcanti who had remained in the drawing room with the ladies was the last to leave the bankerâ house_of_peers the next morning as soon as he awoke mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars asked for the newspapers they were brought to him he laid aside three or four and at last fixed on lâ impartial the paper of which m_beauchamp was the chief editor he hastily tore off the cover opened the journal with nervous precipitation passed contemptuously over the paris jottings and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence stopped with a malicious smile at a paragraph headed we hear from ali_pasha_of_yanina very good observed mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars after having read the paragraph here is a little article on colonel m_fernand_mondego which if i am not mistaken would render the explanation which the comte de viscount_albert_de_morcerf required of me perfectly unnecessary at the same moment that is at nine oâ clock in the morning monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf dressed in a black coat buttoned up to his chin might have been seen walking with a quick and agitated step in the direction of monte cristoâ house_of_peers in the champs lysã es when he presented himself at the gate the porter informed him that the count had gone out about half an hour previously did he take monsieur_baptistin with him â no my lord â call him then i wish to speak to him the concierge went to seek the valet de chambre and returned with him in an instant my
good friend said monsieur_albert i beg pardon for my intrusion but i was anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out or not â he is really out sir replied monsieur_baptistin out even to me â i know how happy my master always is to receive the vicomte said monsieur_baptistin and i should therefore never think of including him in any general order â you are right and now i wish to see him on an affair of great importance do you think it will be long before he comes in â no i think not for he ordered his breakfast at ten oâ clock â well i will go and take a turn in the champs lysã es and at ten oâ clock i will return here meanwhile if the count should come in will you beg him not to go out again without seeing me â you may depend on my doing so sir said monsieur_baptistin monsieur_albert left the cab in which he had come at the countâ door intending to take a turn on foot as he was passing the allã des veuves he thought he saw the countâ horse standing at gossetâ shooting gallery he approached and soon recognized the coachman is the count shooting in the gallery said viscount_albert_de_morcerf â_yes sir replied the coachman while he was speaking monsieur_albert had heard the report of two or three pistol shots he entered and on his way met the waiter excuse me my lord said the lad but will you have the kindness to wait a moment â what for philip asked monsieur_albert who being a constant visitor there did not understand this opposition to his entrance because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone and never practices in the presence of anyone â not even before you philip
then who loads his pistol â his servant â a nubian â a negro â_it is he then â do you know this gentleman â_yes and i am come to look for him he is a friend of mine â_oh that is quite another thing then i will go immediately and inform him of your arrival and philip urged by his own curiosity entered the gallery a second afterwards count_of_monte_cristo appeared on the threshold i ask your pardon my dear count said monsieur_albert for following you here and i must first tell you that it was not the fault of your servant that i did so i alone am to blame for the indiscretion i went to your house_of_peers and they told me you were out but that they expected you home at ten oâ clock to breakfast i was walking about in order to pass away the time till ten oâ clock when i caught sight of your carriage and horse â what you have just said induces me to hope that you intend breakfasting with me 40092m no thank you i am thinking of other thing besides breakfast just now perhaps we may take that meal at a later hour and in worse company â what on earth are you talking of â i am to fight today â for what â for the sake of fighting â_yes i understand that but what is the quarrel people fight for all sorts of reasons you know â i fight in the cause of honor â ah that is something serious â so serious that i come to beg you to render me a service â what is it â to be my second â that is a serious matter and we will not discuss it here let us speak of nothing till we get home ali_pasha_of_yanina bring me some water
the count turned up his sleeves and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hand after shooting come in my lord said philip in a low tone and i will show you something droll viscount_albert_de_morcerf entered and in place of the usual target he saw some playing cards fixed against the wall at a distance monsieur_albert thought it was a complete suit for he counted from the ace to the ten ah ha said monsieur_albert i see you were preparing for a game of cards â no said the count i was making a suit â how said monsieur_albert those are really aces and twos which you see but my shots have turned them into threes fives sevens eights nines and tens monsieur_albert approached in fact the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the exact place which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied the lines and distances being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled with pencil in going up to the target viscount_albert_de_morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the countâ pistol diable said viscount_albert_de_morcerf what would you have my dear viscount said count_of_monte_cristo wiping his hand on the towel which ali_pasha_of_yanina had brought him i must occupy my leisure moment in some way or other but come i am waiting for you both man entered monte cristoâ carriage which in the course of a few minute deposited them safely at no 30 count_of_monte_cristo took monsieur_albert into his study and pointing to a seat placed another for himself now let us talk the matter over quietly said the count you see i am perfectly composed said monsieur_albert
â with whom are you going to fight â with m_beauchamp â one of your friend â of course it is always with friend that one fights â i suppose you have some cause of quarrel â i have 40094m what has he done to you â there appeared in his journal last nightâ but wait and read for yourself and monsieur_albert handed over the paper to the count who read as follows a correspondent at ali_pasha_of_yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we had remained in ignorance the castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the turks by a french officer named m_fernand_mondego in whom the grand vizier ali_pasha_of_yanina tepelini had reposed the greatest confidence â well said count_of_monte_cristo what do you see in that to annoy you â what do i see in it â_yes what does it signify to you if the castle of ali_pasha_of_yanina was given up by a french officer â_it signifies to my father the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf whose christian name is m_fernand_mondego â did your father serve under ali_pasha_of_yanina â_yes that is to say he fought for the independence of the greeks and hence arises the calumny â_oh my dear viscount do talk reason â i do not desire to do otherwise â now just tell me who the devil should know in france that the officer m_fernand_mondego and the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf are one and the same person and who cares now about ali_pasha_of_yanina which was taken as long ago as the year 1822 or 1823 â that just shows the meanness of this slander they have allowed all this time to elapse and then all of a sudden rake up events which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal in order to tarnish the lustre of our high position
i inherit my fatherâ name and i do not choose that the shadow of disgrace should darken it i am going to m_beauchamp in whose journal this paragraph appears and i shall insist on his retracting the assertion before two witnesses â m_beauchamp will never retract â then we must fight â no you will not for he will tell you what is very true that perhaps there were fifty officers in the greek army bearing the same name â we will fight nevertheless i will efface that blot on my fatherâ character my father who was such a brave soldier whose career was so brilliantâ â â_oh well he will add we are warranted in believing that this m_fernand_mondego is not the illustrious count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf who also bears the same christian name â i am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retractation â and you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses do you â_yes â you do wrong â which means i suppose that you refuse the service which i asked of you â you know my theory regarding duels i told you my opinion on that subject if you remember when we were at rome â nevertheless my dear count i found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to entertain â because my dear fellow you understand one must never be eccentric if oneâ lot is cast among fools it is necessary to study folly
i shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with m_beauchamp he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other he will bring his witnesses or will insult me in some public place and i am expected to kill him for all that â you admit that you would fight then well if so why do you object to my doing so â i do not say that you ought not to fight i only say that a duel is a serious thing and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection â did he reflect before he insulted my father â if he spoke hastily and owns that he did so you ought to be satisfied â ah my dear count you are far too indulgent â and you are far too exacting supposing for instance and do not be angry at what i am going to sayâ â well â supposing the assertion to be really true â a son ought not to submit to such a stain on his fatherâ honor â ma foi we live in time when there is much to which we must submit â that is precisely the fault of the age â and do you undertake to reform it â_yes as far as i am personally concerned â well you are indeed exacting my dear fellow â_yes i own it â are you quite impervious to good advice â not when it comes from a friend â and do you account me that title â certainly i do â well then before going to m_beauchamp with your witnesses seek further information on the subject â from whom â from haydã_e â why what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affair what
can she do in it â she can declare to you for example that your father had no hand whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier or if by chance he had indeed the misfortune toâ â i have told you my dear count that i would not for one moment admit of such a proposition â you reject this means of information then â i doâ most decidedly â then let me offer one more word of advice â do so then but let it be the last â you do not wish to hear it perhaps â on the contrary i request it â do not take any witnesses with you when you go to beauchampâ visit him alone â that would be contrary to all custom â your case is not an ordinary one â and what is your reason for advising me to go alone â because then the affair will rest between you and m_beauchamp â explain yourself â i will do so if m_beauchamp be disposed to retract you ought at least to give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free will the satisfaction to you will be the same if on the contrary he refuses to do so it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your secret â they will not be strangers they will be friend â ah but the friend of today are the enemies of tomorrow m_beauchamp for instance â so you recommendâ â i recommend you to be prudent â then you advise me to go alone to m_beauchamp â i do and i will tell you why when you wish to obtain some concession from a manâ self love you must avoid even the appearance of wishing to wound it â i believe you are right â i am glad of it
â then i will go alone â go but you would do better still by not going at all â that is impossible â do so then it will be a wiser plan than the first which you proposed â but if in spite of all my precautions i am at last obliged to fight will you not be my second â my dear viscount said count_of_monte_cristo gravely you must have seen before today that at all time and in all place i have been at your disposal but the service which you have just demanded of me is one which it is out of my power to render you â why â perhaps you may know at some future period and in the mean time i request you to excuse my declining to put you in possession of my reasons â well i will have m_franz_de_quesnel and baron_de_chã_teau_renaud they will be the very man for it â do so then â but if i do fight you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing â that too is impossible â what a singular being you are you will not interfere in anything â you are rightâ that is the principle on which i wish to act â we will say no more about it then good bye count viscount_albert_de_morcerf took his hat and left the room he found his carriage at the door and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find m_beauchamp who was in his office it was a gloomy dusty looking apartment such as journalistsâ offices have always been from time immemorial the servant announced monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf m_beauchamp repeated the name to himself as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright and then gave order for him to be admitted monsieur_albert entered
beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room this way this way my dear monsieur_albert said he holding out his hand to the young man are you out of your senses or do you come peaceably to take breakfast with me try and find a seatâ there is one by that geranium which is the only thing in the room to remind me that there are other leaves in the world besides leaves of paper â m_beauchamp said monsieur_albert â_it is of your journal that i come to speak â indeed what do you wish to say about it â i desire that a statement contained in it should be rectified â to what do you refer but pray sit down â thank you said monsieur_albert with a cold and formal bow will you now have the kindness to explain the nature of the statement which has displeased you â an announcement has been made which implicates the honor of a member of my family â what is it said m_beauchamp much surprised surely you must be mistaken â the story sent you from ali_pasha_of_yanina â ali_pasha_of_yanina â_yes really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which brings me here â such is really the case i assure you upon my honor baptiste give me yesterdayâ paper cried m_beauchamp here i have brought mine with me replied monsieur_albert m_beauchamp took the paper and read the article to which monsieur_albert pointed in an undertone you see it is a serious annoyance said viscount_albert_de_morcerf when m_beauchamp had finished the perusal of the paragraph is the officer referred to a relation of yours then demanded the journalist â_yes said monsieur_albert blushing well what do you wish me to do for you said m_beauchamp mildly my
dear m_beauchamp i wish you to contradict this statement m_beauchamp looked at monsieur_albert with a benevolent expression come said he this matter will want a good deal of talking over a retractation is always a serious thing you know sit down and i will read it again monsieur_albert resumed his seat and m_beauchamp read with more attention than at first the lines denounced by his friend well said monsieur_albert in a determined tone you see that your paper has insulted a member of my family and i insist on a retractation being made â you insist â_yes i insist â permit me to remind you that you are not in the chamber my dear viscount â nor do i wish to be there replied the young man rising i repeat that i am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted you have known me long enough continued monsieur_albert biting his lip convulsively for he saw that beauchampâ anger was beginning to rise â you have been my friend and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that i am likely to maintain my resolution on this point â if i have been your friend viscount_albert_de_morcerf your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that i ever bore that title but wait a moment do not let us get angry or at least not yet you are irritated and vexedâ tell me how this m_fernand_mondego is related to you â he is merely my father said albertâ m_fernand_mondego count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf an old soldier who has fought in twenty battles and whose honorable scars they would denounce as badges of disgrace â is it your father said m_beauchamp that is quite another thing then i can well understand your indignation my dear monsieur_albert
i will look at it again and he read the paragraph for the third time laying a stress on each word as he proceeded but the paper nowhere identifies this m_fernand_mondego with your father 40100m no but the connection will be seen by others and therefore i will have the article contradicted at the word i will m_beauchamp steadily raised his eye to albertâ countenance and then as gradually lowering them he remained thoughtful for a few moment you will retract this assertion will you not m_beauchamp said monsieur_albert with increased though stifled anger â_yes replied m_beauchamp immediately said monsieur_albert when i am convinced that the statement is false â what â the thing is worth looking into and i will take pains to investigate the matter thoroughly â but what is there to investigate sir said monsieur_albert enraged beyond measure at beauchampâ last remark if you do not believe that it is my father say so immediately and if on the contrary you believe it to be him state your reasons for doing so m_beauchamp looked at monsieur_albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied emotion of his mind sir replied he if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction you should have gone at once to the point and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which i have been patiently listening for the last half hour am i to put this construction on your visit â_yes if you will not consent to retract that infamous calumny â wait a momentâ no threats if you please m_fernand_mondego vicomte de viscount_albert_de_morcerf i never allow them from my enemies and therefore shall not put up with them from my friend
you insist on my contradicting the article relating to general m_fernand_mondego an article with which i assure you on my word of honor i had nothing whatever to do â_yes i insist on it said monsieur_albert whose mind was beginning to get bewildered with the excitement of his feelings and if i refuse to retract you wish to fight do you said m_beauchamp in a calm tone â_yes replied monsieur_albert raising his voice well said m_beauchamp here is my answer my dear sir the article was not inserted by meâ i was not even aware of it but you have by the step you have taken called my attention to the paragraph in question and it will remain until it shall be either contradicted or confirmed by someone who has a right to do so â sir said monsieur_albert rising i will do myself the honor of sending my seconds to you and you will be kind enough to arrange with them the place of meeting and the weapons â certainly my dear sir â and this evening if you please or tomorrow at the latest we will meet â no no i will be on the ground at the proper time but in my opinion and i have a right to dictate the preliminaries as it is i who have received the provocation in my opinion the time ought not to be yet i know you to be well skilled in the management of the sword while i am only moderately so i know too that you are a good marksmanâ there we are about equal i know that a duel between us two would be a serious affair because you are brave and i am brave also i do not therefore wish either to kill you or to be killed myself without a cause
now i am going to put a question to you and one very much to the purpose too do you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if i do not make it although i have repeated more than once and affirmed on my honor that i was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me and although i still declare that it is impossible for anyone but you to recognize the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf under the name of m_fernand_mondego â i maintain my original resolution â very well my dear sir then i consent to cut throats with you but i require three weeksâ preparation at the end of that time i shall come and say to you the assertion is false and i retract it or the assertion is true when i shall immediately draw the sword from its sheath or the pistols from the case whichever you please â three weeks cried monsieur_albert they will pass as slowly as three centuries when i am all the time suffering dishonor â had you continued to remain on amicable terms with me i should have said patience my friend but you have constituted yourself my enemy therefore i say what does that signify to me sir â well let it be three weeks then said viscount_albert_de_morcerf but remember at the expiration of that time no delay or subterfuge will justify you inâ â m monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf said m_beauchamp rising in his turn i cannot throw you out of window for three weeksâ that is to say for twenty four day to comeâ nor have you any right to split my skull open till that time has elapsed today is the 29th of august the 21st of september will therefore be the conclusion of the term agreed on and till that time
arrivesâ and it is the advice of a gentleman which i am about to give youâ till then we will refrain from growling and barking like two dogs chained within sight of each other when he had concluded his speech m_beauchamp bowed coldly to monsieur_albert turned his back upon him and went to the press room monsieur_albert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers which he sent flying all over the office by switching them violently with his stick after which ebullition he departedâ not however without walking several time to the door of the press room as if he had half a mind to enter 40104m while monsieur_albert was lashing the front of his carriage in the same manner that he had the newspapers which were the innocent agents of his discomfiture as he was crossing the barrier he perceived m_maximilian_morrel who was walking with a quick step and a bright eye he was passing the chinese baths and appeared to have come from the direction of the porte saint martin and to be going towards the madeleine ah said viscount_albert_de_morcerf there goes a happy man and it so happened monsieur_albert was not mistaken in his opinion chapter 79 the lemonade m_maximilian_morrel was in fact very happy m_noirtier_de_villefort had just sent for him and he was in such haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not stopped to take a cab placing infinitely more dependence on his own two legs than on the four legs of a cab horse he had therefore set off at a furious rate from the rue meslay and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the faubourg saint honorã m_maximilian_morrel advanced with a firm manly tread and poor barrois followed him as he best might
morrel was only thirty one barrois was sixty year of age m_maximilian_morrel was deeply in love and barrois was dying with heat and exertion these two man thus opposed in age and interests resembled two part of a triangle presenting the extremes of separation yet nevertheless possessing their point of union this point of union was m_noirtier_de_villefort and it was he who had just sent for m_maximilian_morrel with the request that the latter would lose no time in coming to himâ a command which m_maximilian_morrel obeyed to the letter to the great discomfiture of barrois on arriving at the house_of_peers m_maximilian_morrel was not even out of breath for love lends wings to our desires but barrois who had long forgotten what it was to love was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use the old servant introduced m_maximilian_morrel by a private entrance closed the door of the study and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort she looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress and m_maximilian_morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her grandfather but the easy chair of the old man was heard rolling along the floor and he soon made his appearance in the room m_noirtier_de_villefort acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks which m_maximilian_morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and himselfâ an intervention which had saved them from despair m_maximilian_morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort was sitting at a little distance from them timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to speak m_noirtier_de_villefort fixed his eye on her
â am i to say what you told me asked mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort m_noirtier_de_villefort made a sign that she was to do so monsieur_albert m_maximilian_morrel said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort to the young man who was regarding her with the most intense interest my grandfather m_noirtier_de_villefort had a thousand thing to say which he told me three day ago and now he has sent for you that i may repeat them to you i will repeat them then and since he has chosen me as his interpreter i will be faithful to the trust and will not alter a word of his intentions â_oh i am listening with the greatest impatience replied the young man speak i beg of you mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort cast down her eye this was a good omen for m_maximilian_morrel for he knew that nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort my grandfather intends leaving this house_of_peers said she and barrois is looking out for suitable apartments for him in another â but you mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort you who are necessary to noirtierâ happinessâ â i interrupted mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort i shall not leave my grandfather that is an understood thing between us my apartment will be close to his now m_noirtier_de_villefort must either give his consent to this plan or his refusal in the first case i shall leave directly and in the second i shall wait till i am of age which will be in about ten month then i shall be free i shall have an independent fortune andâ â and what demanded m_maximilian_morrel and with my grandfatherâ consent i shall fulfil the promise which i have made you mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort pronounced these last few word in such a low tone that nothing but morrelâ intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear them have
i not explained your wishes grandpapa said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort addressing m_noirtier_de_villefort â_yes looked the old man once under my grandfatherâ roof m_maximilian_morrel can visit me in the presence of my good and worthy protector if we still feel that the union we contemplated will be likely to insure our future comfort and happiness in that case i shall expect m_maximilian_morrel to come and claim me at my own hand but alas i have heard it said that heart inflamed by obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security i trust we shall never find it so in our experience â_oh cried m_maximilian_morrel almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before m_noirtier_de_villefort and mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and to adore them as two superior beings what have i ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness â until that time continued the young girl in a calm and self possessed tone of voice we will conform to circumstances and be guided by the wishes of our friend so long as those wishes do not tend finally to separate us in a word and i repeat it because it expresses all i wish to convey we will wait â and i swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes sir said m_maximilian_morrel not only with resignation but with cheerfulness â therefore continued mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort looking playfully at m_maximilian_morrel no more inconsiderate actionsâ no more rash projects for you surely would not wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as destined honorably and happily to bear your name m_maximilian_morrel looked obedience to her commands
noirtier regarded the lovers with a look of ineffable tenderness while barrois who had remained in the room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that passed smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead how hot you look my good barrois said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort ah i have been running very fast mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars but i must do m_maximilian_morrel the justice to say that he ran still faster m_noirtier_de_villefort directed their attention to a waiter on which was placed a decanter containing lemonade and a glass the decanter was nearly full with the exception of a little which had been already drunk by m_noirtier_de_villefort come barrois said the young girl take some of this lemonade i see you are coveting a good draught of it â the fact is mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars said barrois i am dying with thirst and since you are so kind as to offer it me i cannot say i should at all object to drinking your health in a glass of it â take some then and come back immediately barrois took away the waiter and hardly was he outside the door which in his haste he forgot to shut than they saw him throw back his head and empty to the very dregs the glass which mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort had filled mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and m_maximilian_morrel were exchanging their adieux in the presence of m_noirtier_de_villefort when a ring was heard at the door bell it was the signal of a visit mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort looked at her watch â_it is past noon said she and today is saturday i dare say it is the doctor grandpapa m_noirtier_de_villefort looked his conviction that she was right in her supposition
â he will come in here and m_maximilian_morrel had better go do you not think so grandpapa â_yes signed the old man barrois cried mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort barrois â i am coming mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars replied he barrois will open the door for you said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort addressing m_maximilian_morrel and now remember one thing monsieur_albert officer that my grandfather commands you not to take any rash or ill advised step which would be likely to compromise our happiness 40108m i promised him to wait replied m_maximilian_morrel and i will wait at this moment barrois entered who rang asked mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort doctor dâ avrigny said barrois staggering as if he would fall what is the matter barrois said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort the old man did not answer but looked at his master with wild staring eye while with his cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand upright he is going to fall cried m_maximilian_morrel the rigors which had attacked barrois gradually increased the features of the face became quite altered and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous disorder m_noirtier_de_villefort seeing barrois in this pitiable condition showed by his look all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of man barrois made some step towards his master ah sir said he tell me what is the matter with me i am sufferingâ i cannot see a thousand fiery darts are piercing my brain ah donâ touch me pray donâ â by this time his haggard eye had the appearance of being ready to start from their sockets his head fell back and the lower extremities of the body began to stiffen mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort uttered a cry of horror m_maximilian_morrel took her in his arm as if to defend her from some unknown danger
â dâ avrigny dâ avrigny cried she in a stifled voice help help barrois turned round and with a great effort stumbled a few step then fell at the foot of m_noirtier_de_villefort and resting his hand on the knee of the invalid exclaimed my master my good master at this moment m_noirtier_de_villefort attracted by the noise appeared on the threshold m_maximilian_morrel relaxed his hold of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and retreating to a distant corner of the room remained half hidden behind a curtain pale as if he had been gazing on a serpent he fixed his terrified eye on the agonized sufferer m_noirtier_de_villefort burning with impatience and terror was in despair at his utter inability to help his old domestic whom he regarded more in the light of a friend than a servant one might by the fearful swelling of the veins of his forehead and the contraction of the muscles round the eye trace the terrible conflict which was going on between the living energetic mind and the inanimate and helpless body barrois his features convulsed his eye suffused with blood and his head thrown back was lying at full length beating the floor with his hand while his legs had become so stiff that they looked as if they would break rather than bend a slight appearance of foam was visible around the mouth and he breathed painfully and with extreme difficulty m_noirtier_de_villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment and remained gazing intently on the scene before him without uttering a word he had not seen m_maximilian_morrel after a moment of dumb contemplation during which his face became pale and his hair seemed to stand on end he sprang towards the door crying out doctor doctor
come instantly pray come â madame madame cried mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort calling her step mother and running upstairs to meet her come quick quick and bring your bottle of smelling salts with you â what is the matter said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort in a harsh and constrained tone â_oh come come â but where is the doctor exclaimed m_noirtier_de_villefort where is he madame m_noirtier_de_villefort now deliberately descended the staircase in one hand she held her handkerchief with which she appeared to be wiping her face and in the other a bottle of english smelling salts her first look on entering the room was at m_noirtier_de_villefort whose face independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of producing proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health her second glance was at the dying man she turned pale and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested on the master in the name of heaven madame said m_noirtier_de_villefort where is the doctor he was with you just now you see this is a fit of apoplexy and he might be saved if he could but be bled â has he eaten anything lately asked madame m_noirtier_de_villefort eluding her husbandâ question madame replied mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort he has not even breakfasted he has been running very fast on an errand with which my grandfather charged him and when he returned took nothing but a glass of lemonade â ah said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort why did he not take wine lemonade was a very bad thing for him â grandpapaâ bottle of lemonade was standing just by his side poor barrois was very thirsty and was thankful to drink anything he could find madame m_noirtier_de_villefort started m_noirtier_de_villefort looked at her with a glance of the most profound scrutiny he has such a short neck said she
â madame said m_noirtier_de_villefort i ask where is dâ avrigny in godâ name answer me â he is with edward who is not quite well replied madame m_noirtier_de_villefort no longer being able to avoid answering m_noirtier_de_villefort rushed upstairs to fetch him take this said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort giving her smelling bottle to mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort they will no doubt bleed him therefore i will retire for i cannot endure the sight of blood and she followed her husband upstairs m_maximilian_morrel now emerged from his hiding place where he had remained quite unperceived so great had been the general confusion go away as quick as you can m_maximilian_morrel said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and stay till i send for you go m_maximilian_morrel looked towards m_noirtier_de_villefort for permission to retire the old man who had preserved all his usual coolness made a sign to him to do so the young man pressed valentineâ hand to his lip and then left the house_of_peers by a back staircase at the same moment that he quitted the room m_noirtier_de_villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door barrois was now showing signs of returning consciousness the risis seemed past a low moaning was heard and he raised himself on one knee dâ avrigny and m_noirtier_de_villefort laid him on a couch what do you prescribe doctor demanded m_noirtier_de_villefort give me some water and ether you have some in the house_of_peers have you not â_yes â send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic m_noirtier_de_villefort immediately despatched a messenger and now let everyone retire â must i go too asked mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort timidly â_yes mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars you especially replied the doctor abruptly mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort looked at dâ avrigny with astonishment kissed her grandfather on the forehead and left the room the doctor closed the door after her with a gloomy air
â look look doctor said m_noirtier_de_villefort he is quite coming round again i really do not think after all it is anything of consequence m dâ avrigny answered by a melancholy smile how do you feel barrois asked he a little better sir â will you drink some of this ether and water â i will try but donâ touch me â why not â because i feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of your finger the fit would return â drink barrois took the glass and raising it to his purple lip took about half of the liquid offered him where do you suffer asked the doctor everywhere i feel cramps over my whole body â do you find any dazzling sensation before the eye â_yes â any noise in the ears â frightful 40112 â when did you first feel that â just now â suddenly â_yes like a clap of thunder â did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before â nothing â no drowsiness â none â what have you eaten today â i have eaten nothing i only drank a glass of my masterâ lemonadeâ thatâ all and barrois turned towards m_noirtier_de_villefort who immovably fixed in his armchair was contemplating this terrible scene without allowing a word or a movement to escape him where is this lemonade asked the doctor eagerly downstairs in the decanter â whereabouts downstairs â in the kitchen â shall i go and fetch it doctor inquired m_noirtier_de_villefort no stay here and try to make barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water i will go myself and fetch the lemonade dâ avrigny bounded towards the door flew down the back staircase and almost knocked down madame m_noirtier_de_villefort in his haste who was herself going down to the kitchen
she cried out but dâ avrigny paid no attention to her possessed with but one idea he cleared the last four step with a bound and rushed into the kitchen where he saw the decanter about three part empty still standing on the waiter where it had been left he darted upon it as an eagle would seize upon its prey panting with loss of breath he returned to the room he had just left madame m_noirtier_de_villefort was slowly ascending the step which led to her room is this the decanter you spoke of asked dâ avrigny â_yes doctor â is this the same lemonade of which you partook â i believe so â what did it taste like â_it had a bitter taste the doctor poured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his hand put his lip to it and after having rinsed his mouth as a man does when he is tasting wine he spat the liquor into the fireplace â_it is no doubt the same said he did you drink some too m_noirtier_de_villefort â_yes â and did you also discover a bitter taste â_yes â_oh doctor cried barrois the fit is coming on again oh do something for me the doctor flew to his patient that emetic villefortâ see if it is coming m_noirtier_de_villefort sprang into the passage exclaiming the emetic the emetic is it come yet no one answered the most profound terror reigned throughout the house_of_peers if i had anything by means of which i could inflate the lungs said dâ avrigny looking around him perhaps i might prevent suffocation but there is nothing which would do nothing 40114m â_oh sir cried barrois are you going to let me die without help oh i am dying oh save me â a pen a pen said the doctor
there was one lying on the table he endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient who in the midst of his convulsions was making vain attempts to vomit but the jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them this second attack was much more violent than the first and he had slipped from the couch to the ground where he was writhing in agony the doctor left him in this paroxysm knowing that he could do nothing to alleviate it and going up to m_noirtier_de_villefort said abruptly how do you find yourself well â_yes â have you any weight on the chest or does your stomach feel light and comfortableâ eh â_yes â then you feel pretty much as you generally do after you have had the dose which i am accustomed to give you every sunday â_yes â did barrois make your lemonade â_yes â was it you who asked him to drink some of it â no â was it m_noirtier_de_villefort â no â madame â no â_it was your granddaughter then was it not â_yes a groan from barrois accompanied by a yawn which seemed to crack the very jawbones attracted the attention of dâ avrigny he left m_noirtier_de_villefort and returned to the sick man barrois said the doctor can you speak barrois muttered a few unintelligible word try and make an effort to do so my good man said dâ avrigny barrois reopened his bloodshot eye who made the lemonade â i did â did you bring it to your master directly it was made â no â you left it somewhere then in the meantime â_yes i left it in the pantry because i was called away â who brought it into this room then â mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort dâ avrigny struck his forehead with his hand gracious heaven exclaimed he
â doctor doctor cried barrois who felt another fit coming will they never bring that emetic asked the doctor here is a glass with one already prepared said m_noirtier_de_villefort entering the room who prepared it â the chemist who came here with me 40116m drink it said the doctor to barrois impossible doctor it is too late my throat is closing up i am choking oh my heart ah my head â_oh what agony shall i suffer like this long â no no friend replied the doctor you will soon cease to suffer â ah i understand you said the unhappy man my god have mercy upon me and uttering a fearful cry barrois fell back as if he had been struck by lightning dâ avrigny put his hand to his heart and placed a glass before his lip well said m_noirtier_de_villefort go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets m_noirtier_de_villefort went immediately do not be alarmed m_noirtier_de_villefort said dâ avrigny i am going to take my patient into the next room to bleed him this sort of attack is very frightful to witness and taking barrois under the arm he dragged him into an adjoining room but almost immediately he returned to fetch the lemonade m_noirtier_de_villefort closed his right eye you want mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort do you not i will tell them to send her to you m_noirtier_de_villefort returned and dâ avrigny met him in the passage well how is he now asked he come in here said dâ avrigny and he took him into the chamber where the sick man lay is he still in a fit said the procureur
â he is dead m_noirtier_de_villefort drew back a few step and clasping his hand exclaimed with real amazement and sympathy dead and so soon too â_yes it is very soon said the doctor looking at the corpse before him but that ought not to astonish you monsieur_albert and madame_de_saint_mã_ran died as soon people die very suddenly in your house_of_peers m_noirtier_de_villefort â what cried the magistrate with an accent of horror and consternation are you still harping on that terrible idea â still sir and i shall always do so replied dâ avrigny for it has never for one instant ceased to retain possession of my mind and that you may be quite sure i am not mistaken this time listen well to what i am going to say m_noirtier_de_villefort the magistrate trembled convulsively there is a poison which destroys life almost without leaving any perceptible traces i know it well i have studied it in all its forms and in the effects which it produces i recognized the presence of this poison in the case of poor barrois as well as in that of madame_de_saint_mã_ran there is a way of detecting its presence it restores the blue color of litmus paper reddened by an acid and it turns syrup of violets green we have no litmus paper but see here they come with the syrup of violets the doctor was right step were heard in the passage dâ avrigny opened the door and took from the hand of the chambermaid a cup which contained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup he then carefully closed the door
â look said he to the procureur whose heart beat so loudly that it might almost be heard here is in this cup some syrup of violets and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of which m_noirtier_de_villefort and barrois partook if the lemonade be pure and inoffensive the syrup will retain its color if on the contrary the lemonade be drugged with poison the syrup will become green look closely the doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the decanter into the cup and in an instant a light cloudy sediment began to form at the bottom of the cup this sediment first took a blue shade then from the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal and from opal to emerald arrived at this last hue it changed no more the result of the experiment left no doubt whatever on the mind the unfortunate barrois has been poisoned said dâ avrigny and i will maintain this assertion before god and man m_noirtier_de_villefort said nothing but he clasped his hand opened his haggard eye and overcome with his emotion sank into a chair chapter 80 the accusation dâ avrigny soon restored the magistrate to consciousness who had looked like a second corpse in that chamber of death â_oh death is in my house_of_peers cried m_noirtier_de_villefort say rather crime replied the doctor m dâ avrigny cried m_noirtier_de_villefort i cannot tell you all i feel at this moment terror grief madness â_yes said dâ avrigny with an imposing calmness but i think it is now time to act i think it is time to stop this torrent of mortality i can no longer bear to be in possession of these secrets without the hope of seeing the victims and society

the strength of mind you have or rather that which you would not have if instead of my daughter mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort your daughter madeleine were concerned the doctor turned pale doctor every son of woman is born to suffer and to die i am content to suffer and to await death â beware said dâ avrigny â_it may come slowly you will see it approach after having struck your father your wife perhaps your son m_noirtier_de_villefort suffocating pressed the doctorâ arm 40124m listen cried he pity meâ help me no my daughter is not guilty if you drag us both before a tribunal i will still say no my daughter is not guilty there is no crime in my house_of_peers i will not acknowledge a crime in my house_of_peers for when crime enters a dwelling it is like deathâ it does not come alone listen what does it signify to you if i am murdered are you my friend are you a man have you a heart no you are a physician well i tell you i will not drag my daughter before a tribunal and give her up to the executioner the bare idea would kill meâ would drive me like a madman to dig my heart out with my finger nails and if you were mistaken doctorâ if it were not my daughterâ if i should come one day pale as a spectre and say to you assassin you have killed my child â holdâ if that should happen although i am a christian dâ avrigny i should kill myself â well said the doctor after a momentâ silence i will wait m_noirtier_de_villefort looked at him as if he had doubted his word
â only continued dâ avrigny with a slow and solemn tone if anyone falls ill in your house_of_peers if you feel yourself attacked do not send for me for i will come no more i will consent to share this dreadful secret with you but i will not allow shame and remorse to grow and increase in my conscience as crime and misery will in your house_of_peers â then you abandon me doctor â_yes for i can follow you no farther and i only stop at the foot of the scaffold some further discovery will be made which will bring this dreadful tragedy to a close adieu â i entreat you doctor â all the horrors that disturb my thoughts make your house_of_peers odious and fatal adieu sir â one wordâ one single word more doctor you go leaving me in all the horror of my situation after increasing it by what you have revealed to me but what will be reported of the sudden death of the poor old servant â true said dâ avrigny we will return the doctor went out first followed by m_noirtier_de_villefort the terrified servant were on the stairs and in the passage where the doctor would pass sir said dâ avrigny to m_noirtier_de_villefort so loud that all might hear poor barrois has led too sedentary a life of late accustomed formerly to ride on horseback or in the carriage to the four corners of europe the monotonous walk around that armchair has killed himâ his blood has thickened he was stout had a short thick neck he was attacked with apoplexy and i was called in too late by the way added he in a low tone take care to throw away that cup of syrup of violets in the ashes
the doctor without shaking hand with m_noirtier_de_villefort without adding a word to what he had said went out amid the tears and lamentations of the whole household the same evening all villefortâ servant who had assembled in the kitchen and had a long consultation came to tell madame m_noirtier_de_villefort that they wished to leave no entreaty no proposition of increased wages could induce them to remain to every argument they replied we must go for death is in this house_of_peers they all left in spite of prayers and entreaties testifying their regret at leaving so good a master and mistress and especially mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort so good so kind and so gentle m_noirtier_de_villefort looked at mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort as they said this she was in tears and strange as it was in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears he looked also at madame m_noirtier_de_villefort and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lip like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky chapter 81 the room of the retired baker the evening of the day on which the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf had left danglarsâ house_of_peers with feelings of shame and anger at the rejection of the projected alliance m_andrea_cavalcanti with curled hair moustaches in perfect order and white gloves which fitted admirably had entered the courtyard of the bankerâ house_of_peers in rue de la chaussã dâ antin he had not been more than ten minute in the drawing room before he drew mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars aside into the recess of a bow window and after an ingenious preamble related to him all his anxieties and cares since his noble fatherâ departure
he acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown him by the bankerâ family in which he had been received as a son and where besides his warmest affections had found an object on which to centre in mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars listened with the most profound attention he had expected this declaration for the last two or three day and when at last it came his eye glistened as much as they had lowered on listening to viscount_albert_de_morcerf he would not however yield immediately to the young manâ request but made a few conscientious objections are you not rather young m_andrea_cavalcanti to think of marrying â i think not sir replied m_andrea_cavalcanti in italy the nobility generally marry young life is so uncertain that we ought to secure happiness while it is within our reach â well sir said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars in case your proposals which do me honor are accepted by my wife and daughter by whom shall the preliminary arrangements be settled so important a negotiation should i think be conducted by the respective father of the young people â sir my father is a man of great foresight and prudence thinking that i might wish to settle in france he left me at his departure together with the paper establishing my identity a letter promising if he approved of my choice 150 000 livres per annum from the day i was married so far as i can judge i suppose this to be a quarter of my fatherâ revenue â i said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars have always intended giving my daughter 500 000 franc as her dowry she is besides my sole heiress â all would then be easily arranged if the baroness and her daughter are willing we should command an annuity of 175 000 livres
supposing also i should persuade the marquis to give me my capital which is not likely but still is possible we would place these two or three millions in your hand whose talent might make it realize ten per cent â i never give more than four per cent and generally only three and a half but to my son in law i would give five and we would share the profits â very good father in law said m_andrea_cavalcanti yielding to his low born nature which would escape sometimes through the aristocratic gloss with which he sought to conceal it correcting himself immediately he said excuse me sir hope alone makes me almost mad what will not reality do â but said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who on his part did not perceive how soon the conversation which was at first disinterested was turning to a business transaction there is doubtless a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you â which asked the young man that you inherit from your mother â truly from my mother leonora corsinari â how much may it amount to â indeed sir said m_andrea_cavalcanti i assure you i have never given the subject a thought but i suppose it must have been at least two millions mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who finds a lost treasure or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid ground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him up well sir said m_andrea_cavalcanti bowing to the banker respectfully may i hope â you may not only hope said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars but consider it a settled thing if no obstacle arises on your part â i am indeed rejoiced said m_andrea_cavalcanti but said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars thoughtfully how is it that your patron de count_of_monte_cristo did not make his proposal for you m_andrea_cavalcanti blushed imperceptibly
â i have just left the count sir said he he is doubtless a delightful man but inconceivably peculiar in his idea he esteems me highly he even told me he had not the slightest doubt that my father would give me the capital instead of the interest of my property he has promised to use his influence to obtain it for me but he also declared that he never had taken on himself the responsibility of making proposals for another and he never would i must however do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion because he thought the projected union would be a happy and suitable one besides if he will do nothing officially he will answer any questions you propose to him and now continued he with one of his most charming smile having finished talking to the father in law i must address myself to the banker â and what may you have to say to him said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars laughing in his turn that the day after tomorrow i shall have to draw upon you for about four thousand franc but the count expecting my bachelorâ revenue could not suffice for the coming monthâ outlay has offered me a draft for twenty thousand franc it bears his signature as you see which is all sufficient â bring me a million such as that said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i shall be well pleased putting the draft in his pocket fix your own hour for tomorrow and my cashier shall call on you with a check for eighty thousand franc â at
ten oâ clock then if you please i should like it early as i am going into the country tomorrow â very well at ten oâ clock you are still at the hã tel des princes â_yes the following morning with the bankerâ usual punctuality the eighty thousand franc were placed in the young manâ hand as he was on the point of starting after having left two hundred franc for m_caderousse he went out chiefly to avoid this dangerous enemy and returned as late as possible in the evening but scarcely had he stepped out of his carriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand sir said he that man has been here â what man said m_andrea_cavalcanti carelessly apparently forgetting him whom he but too well recollected him to whom your excellency pays that little annuity â_oh said m_andrea_cavalcanti my fatherâ old servant well you gave him the two hundred franc i had left for him â_yes your excellency m_andrea_cavalcanti had expressed a wish to be thus addressed but continued the porter he would not take them m_andrea_cavalcanti turned pale but as it was dark his pallor was not perceptible what he would not take them said he with slight emotion 40130m no he wished to speak to your excellency i told him you were gone out and after some dispute he believed me and gave me this letter which he had brought with him already sealed â give it me said m_andrea_cavalcanti and he read by the light of his carriage lamp
â you know where i live i expect you tomorrow morning at nine oâ clock â m_andrea_cavalcanti examined it carefully to ascertain if the letter had been opened or if any indiscreet eye had seen its contents but it was so carefully folded that no one could have read it and the seal was perfect very well said he poor man he is a worthy creature he left the porter to ponder on these word not knowing which most to admire the master or the servant take out the horse quickly and come up to me said m_andrea_cavalcanti to his groom in two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt caderousseâ letter the servant entered just as he had finished you are about my height pierre said he i have that honor your excellency â you had a new livery yesterday â_yes sir â i have an engagement with a pretty little girl for this evening and do not wish to be known lend me your livery till tomorrow i may sleep perhaps at an inn pierre obeyed five minute after m_andrea_cavalcanti left the hotel completely disguised took a cabriolet and ordered the driver to take him to the cheval rouge at picpus the next morning he left that inn as he had left the hã tel des princes without being noticed walked down the faubourg saint antoine along the boulevard to rue mã nilmontant and stopping at the door of the third house_of_peers on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porterâ absence for whom are you looking my fine fellow asked the fruiteress on the opposite side monsieur_albert pailletin if you please my good woman replied m_andrea_cavalcanti a retired baker asked the fruiteress
â exactly â he life at the end of the yard on the left on the third story 40132m m_andrea_cavalcanti went as she directed him and on the third floor he found a hareâ paw which by the hasty ringing of the bell it was evident he pulled with considerable ill temper a moment after caderousseâ face appeared at the grating in the door ah you are punctual said he as he drew back the door confound you and your punctuality said m_andrea_cavalcanti throwing himself into a chair in a manner which implied that he would rather have flung it at the head of his host come come my little fellow donâ be angry see i have thought about youâ look at the good breakfast we are going to have nothing but what you are fond of m_andrea_cavalcanti indeed inhaled the scent of something cooking which was not unwelcome to him hungry as he was it was that mixture of fat and garlic peculiar to provenã al kitchens of an inferior order added to that of dried fish and above all the pungent smell of musk and cloves these odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot in an adjoining room m_andrea_cavalcanti saw also a tolerably clean table prepared for two two bottles of wine sealed the one with green the other with yellow a supply of brandy in a decanter and a measure of fruit in a cabbage leaf cleverly arranged on an earthenware plate what do you think of it my little fellow said m_caderousse ay that smells good you know i used to be a good cook do you recollect how you used to lick your fingers
you were among the first who tasted any of my dishes and i think you relished them tolerably while speaking m_caderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of onions but said m_andrea_cavalcanti ill temperedly by my faith if it was only to breakfast with you that you disturbed me i wish the devil had taken you â my boy said m_caderousse sententiously one can talk while eating and then you ungrateful being you are not pleased to see an old friend i am weeping with joy he was truly crying but it would have been difficult to say whether joy or the onions produced the greatest effect on the lachrymal glands of the old innkeeper of the pont du gard hold your tongue hypocrite said m_andrea_cavalcanti you love me â_yes i do or may the devil take me i know it is a weakness said m_caderousse but it overpowers me â and yet it has not prevented your sending for me to play me some trick â come said m_caderousse wiping his large knife on his apron if i did not like you do you think i should endure the wretched life you lead me think for a moment you have your servantâ clothes onâ you therefore keep a servant i have none and am obliged to prepare my own meals you abuse my cookery because you dine at the table dâ hã te of the hã tel des princes or the cafã de paris well i too could keep a servant i too could have a tilbury i too could dine where i like but why do i not because i would not annoy my little m_benedetto come just acknowledge that i could eh this address was accompanied by a look which was by no means difficult to understand
â well said m_andrea_cavalcanti admitting your love why do you want me to breakfast with you â that i may have the pleasure of seeing you my little fellow â what is the use of seeing me after we have made all our arrangements â eh dear friend said m_caderousse are wills ever made without codicils but you first came to breakfast did you not well sit down and let us begin with these pilchards and this fresh butter which i have put on some vine leaves to please you wicked one ah yes you look at my room my four straw chairs my images three franc each but what do you expect this is not the hã tel des princes â come you are growing discontented you are no longer happy you who only wish to live like a retired baker m_caderousse sighed well what have you to say you have seen your dream realized â i can still say it is a dream a retired baker my poor m_benedetto is richâ he has an annuity â well you have an annuity â i have 40134m â_yes since i bring you your two hundred franc m_caderousse shrugged his shoulders â_it is humiliating said he thus to receive money given grudgingly an uncertain supply which may soon fail you see i am obliged to economize in case your prosperity should cease well my friend fortune is inconstant as the chaplain of the regiment said i know your prosperity is great you rascal you are to marry the daughter of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â what of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â_yes to be sure must i say baron mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i might as well say count m_benedetto he was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a memory he ought to invite me to your wedding seeing he came to mine
yes yes to mine gad he was not so proud then he was an under clerk to the good m_maximilian_morrel i have dined many time with him and the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf so you see i have some high connections and were i to cultivate them a little we might meet in the same drawing room â come your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light â that is all very fine m_benedetto mio but i know what i am saying perhaps i may one day put on my best coat and presenting myself at the great gate introduce myself meanwhile let us sit down and eat m_caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite praising each dish he set before his visitor the latter seemed to have resigned himself he drew the corks and partook largely of the fish with the garlic and fat ah mate said m_caderousse you are getting on better terms with your old landlord â faith yes replied m_andrea_cavalcanti whose hunger prevailed over every other feeling so you like it you rogue â so much that i wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard living â do you see said m_caderousse all my happiness is marred by one thought â what is that â that i am dependent on another i who have always gained my own livelihood honestly â do not let that disturb you i have enough for two â no truly you may believe me if you will at the end of every month i am tormented by remorse â good m_caderousse â so much so that yesterday i would not take the two hundred franc â_yes you wished to speak to me but was it indeed remorse tell me â true remorse and besides an idea had struck
me m_andrea_cavalcanti shuddered he always did so at caderousseâ idea â_it is miserableâ do you see always to wait till the end of the month â_oh said m_andrea_cavalcanti philosophically determined to watch his companion narrowly does not life pass in waiting do i for instance fare better well i wait patiently do i not â_yes because instead of expecting two hundred wretched franc you expect five or six thousand perhaps ten perhaps even twelve for you take care not to let anyone know the utmost down there you always had little presents and christmas boxes which you tried to hide from your poor friend m_caderousse fortunately he is a cunning fellow that friend m_caderousse â there you are beginning again to ramble to talk again and again of the past but what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again â ah you are only one and twenty and can forget the past i am fifty and am obliged to recollect it but let us return to business â_yes â i was going to say if i were in your placeâ â well â i would realizeâ â how would you realize â i would ask for six monthsâ in advance under pretence of being able to purchase a farm then with my six month i would decamp â well well said m_andrea_cavalcanti that isnâ a bad idea â my dear friend said m_caderousse eat of my bread and take my advice you will be none the worse off physically or morally â but said m_andrea_cavalcanti why do you not act on the advice you gave me why do you not realize a six monthsâ a yearâ advance even and retire to brussels
instead of living the retired baker you might live as a bankrupt using his privileges that would be very good â but how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred franc â ah m_caderousse said m_andrea_cavalcanti how covetous you are two month ago you were dying with hunger â the appetite grows by what it feeds on said m_caderousse grinning and showing his teeth like a monkey laughing or a tiger growling and added he biting off with his large white teeth an enormous mouthful of bread i have formed a plan caderousseâ plans alarmed m_andrea_cavalcanti still more than his idea idea were but the germ the plan was reality let me see your plan i dare say it is a pretty one â why not who formed the plan by which we left the establishment of mâ eh was it not i and it was no bad one i believe since here we are â i do not say replied m_andrea_cavalcanti that you never make a good one but let us see your plan â well pursued m_caderousse can you without expending one sou put me in the way of getting fifteen thousand franc no fifteen thousand are not enough i cannot again become an honest man with less than thirty thousand franc â no replied m_andrea_cavalcanti dryly no i cannot â i do not think you understand me replied m_caderousse calmly i said without your laying out a sou â do
you want me to commit a robbery to spoil all my good fortuneâ and yours with mineâ and both of us to be dragged down there again â_it would make very little difference to me said m_caderousse if i were retaken i am a poor creature to live alone and sometimes pine for my old comrades not like you heartless creature who would be glad never to see them again m_andrea_cavalcanti did more than tremble this time he turned pale come m_caderousse no nonsense said he donâ alarm yourself my little m_benedetto but just point out to me some means of gaining those thirty thousand franc without your assistance and i will contrive it â well iâ ll seeâ iâ ll try to contrive some way said m_andrea_cavalcanti meanwhile you will raise my monthly allowance to five hundred franc my little fellow i have a fancy and mean to get a housekeeper â well you shall have your five hundred franc said m_andrea_cavalcanti but it is very hard for me my poor caderousseâ you take advantageâ â bah said m_caderousse when you have access to countless stores one would have said m_andrea_cavalcanti anticipated his companionâ word so did his eye flash like lightning but it was but for a moment true he replied and my protector is very kind â that dear protector said m_caderousse and how much does he give you monthly â five thousand franc â as many thousands as you give me hundreds truly it is only bastards who are thus fortunate five thousand franc per month what the devil can you do with all that â_oh it is no trouble to spend that and i am like you i want capital â capital yesâ i understandâ everyone would like capital â well and i shall get it â who will give it to youâ your prince â_yes my prince
but unfortunately i must wait 40138m you must wait for what asked m_caderousse for his death â the death of your prince â_yes â how so â because he has made his will in my favor â indeed â on my honor â for how much â for five hundred thousand â only that itâ little enough â but so it is â no it cannot be â are you my friend m_caderousse â_yes in life or death â well i will tell you a secret â what is it â but rememberâ â ah pardieu mute as a carp â well i thinkâ â m_andrea_cavalcanti stopped and looked around you think do not fear pardieu we are alone â i think i have discovered my father â your true father â_yes â not old m_andrea_cavalcanti â no for he has gone again the true one as you say â and that father isâ â well m_caderousse it is count_of_monte_cristo â bah â_yes you understand that explains all he cannot acknowledge me openly it appears but he does it through m_andrea_cavalcanti and gives him fifty thousand franc for it â fifty thousand franc for being your father i would have done it for half that for twenty thousand for fifteen thousand why did you not think of me ungrateful man â did i know anything about it when it was all done when i was down there â ah truly and you say that by his willâ â he leaves me five hundred thousand livres â are you sure of it â he showed it me but that is not allâ there is a codicil as i said just now â probably â and in that codicil he acknowledges me â_oh the good father the brave father the very honest father said m_caderousse twirling a plate in the air between his two hand
â now say if i conceal anything from you â no and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion and your princely father is he rich very rich â_yes he is that he does not himself know the amount of his fortune â is it possible â_it is evident enough to me who am always at his house_of_peers the other day a bankerâ clerk brought him fifty thousand franc in a portfolio about the size of your plate yesterday his banker brought him a hundred thousand franc in gold m_caderousse was filled with wonder the young manâ word sounded to him like metal and he thought he could hear the rushing of cascades of louis_xviii and you go into that house_of_peers cried he briskly when i like m_caderousse was thoughtful for a moment it was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind then suddenly â how i should like to see all that cried he how beautiful it must be â_it is in fact magnificent said m_andrea_cavalcanti and does he not live in the champs lysã es â_yes no 30 â ah said m_caderousse no 30 â_yes a fine house_of_peers standing alone between a courtyard and a garden you must know it â possibly but it is not the exterior i care for it is the interior what beautiful furniture there must be in it â have you ever seen the tuileries â no â well it surpasses that â_it must be worth oneâ while to stoop m_andrea_cavalcanti when that good count_of_monte_cristo lets fall his purse â_it is not worthwhile to wait for that said m_andrea_cavalcanti money is as plentiful in that house_of_peers as fruit in an orchard â but you should take me there one day with you â how can i on what plea â you are right but you have made my mouth water
i must absolutely see it i shall find a way â no nonsense m_caderousse â i will offer myself as floor polisher â the room are all carpeted â well then i must be contented to imagine it â that is the best plan believe me â try at least to give me an idea of what it is â how can i â nothing is easier is it large â middling â how is it arranged â faith i should require pen ink and paper to make a plan â they are all here said m_caderousse briskly he fetched from an old secretaire a sheet of white paper and pen and ink here said m_caderousse draw me all that on the paper my boy m_andrea_cavalcanti took the pen with an imperceptible smile and began the house_of_peers as i said is between the court and the garden in this way do you see m_andrea_cavalcanti drew the garden the court and the house_of_peers 40142 â high wall â not more than eight or ten foot â that is not prudent said m_caderousse in the court are orange trees in pots turf and clumps of flowers â and no steel traps â no â the stables â are on either side of the gate which you see there and m_andrea_cavalcanti continued his plan let us see the ground floor said m_caderousse on the ground floor dining room two drawing room billiard room staircase in the hall and a little back staircase â window â magnificent window so beautiful so large that i believe a man of your size should pass through each frame â why the devil have they any stairs with such window â luxury has everything â but shutters â_yes but they are never used that count_of_monte_cristo is an original who loves to look at the sky even at night â and where do the servant sleep â_oh they have a house_of_peers to themselves
picture to yourself a pretty coach house_of_peers at the right hand side where the ladders are kept well over that coach house_of_peers are the servantsâ room with bells corresponding with the different apartments â ah diable bells did you say â what do you mean â_oh nothing i only say they cost a load of money to hang and what is the use of them i should like to know â there used to be a dog let loose in the yard at night but it has been taken to the house_of_peers at auteuil to that you went to you know â_yes â i was saying to him only yesterday you are imprudent monsieur_albert count for when you go to auteuil and take your servant the house_of_peers is left unprotected â well said he what next â well next some day you will be robbed â what did he answer â he quietly said what do i care if i am â m_andrea_cavalcanti he has some secretaire with a spring â how do you know â_yes which catches the thief in a trap and plays a tune i was told there were such at the last exhibition â he has simply a mahogany secretaire in which the key is always kept â and he is not robbed â no his servant are all devoted to him â there ought to be some money in that secretaire â there may be no one knows what there is â and where is it â on the first floor â sketch me the plan of that floor as you have done of the ground floor my boy â that is very simple m_andrea_cavalcanti took the pen on the first story do you see there is the anteroom and the drawing room to the right of the drawing room a library and a study to the left a bedroom and a dressing room
the famous secretaire is in the dressing room â is there a window in the dressing room â two one here and one there m_andrea_cavalcanti sketched two window in the room which formed an angle on the plan and appeared as a small square added to the rectangle of the bedroom m_caderousse became thoughtful does he often go to auteuil added he two or three time a week tomorrow for instance he is going to spend the day and night there â are you sure of it â he has invited me to dine there â thereâ a life for you said m_caderousse a town house_of_peers and a country house_of_peers â that is what it is to be rich â and shall you dine there â probably â when you dine there do you sleep there â if i like i am at home there m_caderousse looked at the young man as if to get at the truth from the bottom of his heart but m_andrea_cavalcanti drew a cigar case from his pocket took a havana quietly lit it and began smoking when do you want your twelve hundred franc said he to m_caderousse now if you have them m_andrea_cavalcanti took five and twenty louis_xviii from his pocket yellow boys said m_caderousse no i thank you â_oh you despise them â on the contrary i esteem them but will not have them â you can change them idiot gold is worth five sous â exactly and he who changes them will follow friend m_caderousse lay hand on him and demand what farmers pay him their rent in gold no nonsense my good fellow silver simply round coins with the head of some monarch or other on them anybody may possess a five franc piece â but do you suppose i carry five hundred franc about with me
i should want a porter â well leave them with your porter he is to be trusted i will call for them â today â no tomorrow i shall not have time today â well tomorrow i will leave them when i go to auteuil â may i depend on it â certainly â because i shall secure my housekeeper on the strength of it â now see here will that be all eh and will you not torment me any more â never m_caderousse had become so gloomy that m_andrea_cavalcanti feared he should be obliged to notice the change he redoubled his gayety and carelessness how sprightly you are said m_caderousse one would say you were already in possession of your property â no unfortunately but when i do obtain itâ â well â i shall remember old friend i can tell you that â_yes since you have such a good memory â what do you want it look as if you were trying to fleece me â i what an idea i who am going to give you another piece of good advice â what is it â to leave behind you the diamond you have on your finger we shall both get into trouble you will ruin both yourself and me by your folly â how so said m_andrea_cavalcanti how you put on a livery you disguise yourself as a servant and yet keep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand franc â you guess well â i know something of diamonds i have had some â you do well to boast of it said m_andrea_cavalcanti who without becoming angry as m_caderousse feared at this new extortion quietly resigned the ring m_caderousse looked so closely at it that m_andrea_cavalcanti well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were perfect â_it is a false diamond said m_caderousse
â you are joking now replied m_andrea_cavalcanti do not be angry we can try it m_caderousse went to the window touched the glass with it and found it would cut confiteor said m_caderousse putting the diamond on his little finger i was mistaken but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jewellerâ shopâ it is another branch of industry paralyzed â have you finished said m_andrea_cavalcanti â do you want anything more will you have my waistcoat or my hat make free now you have begun â no you are after all a good companion i will not detain you and will try to cure myself of my ambition â but take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the diamond you feared with the gold â i shall not sell itâ do not fear â not at least till the day after tomorrow thought the young man happy rogue said m_caderousse you are going to find your servant your horse your carriage and your betrothed â_yes said m_andrea_cavalcanti well i hope you will make a handsome wedding present the day you marry mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â i have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head â what fortune has she â but i tell youâ â a million m_andrea_cavalcanti shrugged his shoulders let it be a million said m_caderousse you can never have so much as i wish you â thank you said the young man â_oh i wish it you with all my heart added m_caderousse with his hoarse laugh stop let me show you the way â_it is not worthwhile â yes
it is â why â because there is a little secret a precaution i thought it desirable to take one of huret fichetâ locks revised and improved by gaspard_caderousse m_caderousse i will manufacture you a similar one when you are a capitalist â thank you said m_andrea_cavalcanti i will let you know a week beforehand they parted m_caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen m_andrea_cavalcanti go down the three stories but also cross the court then he returned hastily shut his door carefully and began to study like a clever architect the plan m_andrea_cavalcanti had left him dear m_benedetto said he i think he will not be sorry to inherit his fortune and he who hastens the day when he can touch his five hundred thousand will not be his worst friend chapter 82 the burglary the day following that on which the conversation we have related took place the count_of_monte_cristo set out for auteuil accompanied by ali_pasha_of_yanina and several attendants and also taking with him some horse whose qualities he was desirous of ascertaining he was induced to undertake this journey of which the day before he had not even thought and which had not occurred to m_andrea_cavalcanti either by the arrival of monsieur_bertuccio from normandy with intelligence respecting the house_of_peers and sloop the house_of_peers was ready and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a small creek with her crew of six man who had observed all the requisite formalities and were ready again to put to sea the count praised bertuccioâ zeal and ordered him to prepare for a speedy departure as his stay in france would not be prolonged more than a month now
â said he i may require to go in one night from paris to trã port let eight fresh horse be in readiness on the road which will enable me to go fifty leagues in ten hour â your highness had already expressed that wish said monsieur_bertuccio and the horse are ready i have bought them and stationed them myself at the most desirable posts that is in villages where no one generally stops â thatâ well said count_of_monte_cristo i remain here a day or twoâ arrange accordingly as monsieur_bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite order monsieur_baptistin opened the door he held a letter on a silver waiter what are you doing here asked the count seeing him covered with dust i did not send for you i think monsieur_baptistin without answering approached the count and presented the letter important and urgent said he the count opened the letter and read â de count_of_monte_cristo is apprised that this night a man will enter his house_of_peers in the champs lysã es with the intention of carrying off some paper supposed to be in the secretaire in the dressing room the countâ well known courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice the count by any opening from the bedroom or by concealing himself in the dressing room would be able to defend his property himself many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from the attempt and de count_of_monte_cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the count a warning he might not be able to send another time if this first attempt should fail and another be made â
the countâ first idea was that this was an artificeâ a gross deception to draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose him to a greater he was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of police notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend or perhaps because of that advice when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it might be some personal enemy whom he alone should recognize and over whom if such were the case he alone would gain any advantage as fiesco17 had done over the moor who would have killed him we know the countâ vigorous and daring mind denying anything to be impossible with that energy which marks the great man from his past life from his resolution to shrink from nothing the count had acquired an inconceivable relish for the contests in which he had engaged sometimes against nature that is to say against god and sometimes against the world that is against the devil they do not want my paper said count_of_monte_cristo they want to kill me they are no robbers but assassins i will not allow the prefect of police to interfere with my private affairs i am rich enough forsooth to distribute his authority on this occasion the count recalled monsieur_baptistin who had left the room after delivering the letter return to paris said he assemble the servant who remain there i want all my household at auteuil â but will no one remain in the house_of_peers my lord asked monsieur_baptistin â_yes the porter â my lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the house_of_peers â well â the house_of_peers might be stripped without his hearing the least noise â by whom â by thieves â you are a fool monsieur_baptistin
thieves might strip the houseâ it would annoy me less than to be disobeyed monsieur_baptistin bowed 40150 â you understand me said the count bring your comrades here one and all but let everything remain as usual only close the shutters of the ground floor â and those of the first floor â you know they are never closed go the count signified his intention of dining alone and that no one but ali_pasha_of_yanina should attend him having dined with his usual tranquillity and moderation the count making a signal to ali_pasha_of_yanina to follow him went out by the side gate and on reaching the bois de boulogne turned apparently without design towards paris and at twilight found himself opposite his house_of_peers in the champs lysã es all was dark one solitary feeble light was burning in the porterâ lodge about forty paces distant from the house_of_peers as monsieur_baptistin had said count_of_monte_cristo leaned against a tree and with that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived looked up and down the avenue examined the passers by and carefully looked down the neighboring streets to see that no one was concealed ten minute passed thus and he was convinced that no one was watching him he hastened to the side door with ali_pasha_of_yanina entered hurriedly and by the servantsâ staircase of which he had the key gained his bedroom without opening or disarranging a single curtain without even the porter having the slightest suspicion that the house_of_peers which he supposed empty contained its chief occupant arrived in his bedroom the count motioned to ali_pasha_of_yanina to stop then he passed into the dressing room which he examined everything appeared as usualâ the precious secretaire in its place and the key in the secretaire
he double locked it took the key returned to the bedroom door removed the double staple of the bolt and went in meanwhile ali_pasha_of_yanina had procured the arm the count requiredâ namely a short carbine and a pair of double barrelled pistols with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a single barrelled one thus armed the count held the life of five man in his hand it was about half past nine the count and ali_pasha_of_yanina ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of spanish wine then count_of_monte_cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels which enabled him to see into the adjoining room he had within his reach his pistols and carbine and ali_pasha_of_yanina standing near him held one of the small arabian hatchets whose form has not varied since the crusades through one of the window of the bedroom on a line with that in the dressing room the count could see into the street two hour passed thus it was intensely dark still ali_pasha_of_yanina thanks to his wild nature and the count thanks doubtless to his long confinement could distinguish in the darkness the slightest movement of the trees the little light in the lodge had long been extinct it might be expected that the attack if indeed an attack was projected would be made from the staircase of the ground floor and not from a window in monte cristoâ opinion the villains sought his life not his money it would be his bedroom they would attack and they must reach it by the back staircase or by the window in the dressing room the clock of the invalides struck a quarter to twelve the west wind bore on its moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three strokes 40152m
as the last stroke died away the count thought he heard a slight noise in the dressing room this first sound or rather this first grinding was followed by a second then a third at the fourth the count knew what to expect a firm and well practised hand was engaged in cutting the four side of a pane of glass with a diamond the count felt his heart beat more rapidly inured as man may be to danger forewarned as they may be of peril they understand by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame the enormous difference between a dream and a reality between the project and the execution however count_of_monte_cristo only made a sign to apprise ali_pasha_of_yanina who understanding that danger was approaching from the other side drew nearer to his master count_of_monte_cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies the window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressing room he fixed his eye on that windowâ he distinguished a shadow in the darkness then one of the panes became quite opaque as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside then the square cracked without falling through the opening an arm was passed to find the fastening then a second the window turned on its hinges and a man entered he was alone thatâ a daring rascal whispered the count at that moment ali_pasha_of_yanina touched him slightly on the shoulder he turned ali_pasha_of_yanina pointed to the window of the room in which they were facing the street i see said he there are two of them one does the work while the other stands guard
he made a sign to ali_pasha_of_yanina not to lose sight of the man in the street and turned to the one in the dressing room the glass cutter had entered and was feeling his way his arm stretched out before him at last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his surroundings there were two door he bolted them both when he drew near to the bedroom door count_of_monte_cristo expected that he was coming in and raised one of his pistols but he simply heard the sound of the bolts sliding in their copper rings it was only a precaution the nocturnal visitor ignorant of the fact that the count had removed the staples might now think himself at home and pursue his purpose with full security alone and free to act as he wished the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern placed it on a stand then went straight to the secretaire felt the lock and contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing but the glass cutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies the count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt ah ha whispered count_of_monte_cristo with a smile of disappointment he is only a thief but the man in the dark could not find the right key he reached the instrument he had placed on the stand touched a spring and immediately a pale light just bright enough to render objects distinct was reflected on his hand and countenance by
heavens exclaimed count_of_monte_cristo starting back â_it isâ â ali_pasha_of_yanina raised his hatchet donâ stir whispered count_of_monte_cristo and put down your hatchet we shall require no arm 40154m then he added some word in a low tone for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count faint as it had been had startled the man who remained in the pose of the old knife grinder it was an order the count had just given for immediately ali_pasha_of_yanina went noiselessly and returned bearing a black dress and a three cornered hat meanwhile count_of_monte_cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat waistcoat and shirt and one might distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail of which the last in france where daggers are no longer dreaded was worn by king louis_xviii xvi who feared the dagger at his breast and whose head was cleft with a hatchet the tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock as did his hair under a priestâ wig the three cornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abbã the man hearing nothing more stood erect and while count_of_monte_cristo was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire whose lock was beginning to crack under his nightingale try again whispered the count who depended on the secret spring which was unknown to the picklock clever as he might beâ try again you have a few minutesâ work there and he advanced to the window
the man whom he had seen seated on a fence had got down and was still pacing the street but strange as it appeared he cared not for those who might pass from the avenue of the champs lysã es or by the faubourg saint honorã his attention was engrossed with what was passing at the countâ and his only aim appeared to be to discern every movement in the dressing room count_of_monte_cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed over his lip then drawing near to ali_pasha_of_yanina he whispered remain here concealed in the dark and whatever noise you hear whatever passes only come in or show yourself if i call you ali_pasha_of_yanina bowed in token of strict obedience count_of_monte_cristo then drew a lighted taper from a closet and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock silently opened the door taking care that the light should shine directly on his face the door opened so quietly that the thief heard no sound but to his astonishment the room was suddenly illuminated he turned ah good evening my dear m_caderousse said count_of_monte_cristo what are you doing here at such an hour 40156m the abbã_busoni exclaimed m_caderousse and not knowing how this strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the door he let fall his bunch of keys and remained motionless and stupefied the count placed himself between m_caderousse and the window thus cutting off from the thief his only chance of retreat the abbã_busoni repeated m_caderousse fixing his haggard gaze on the count â_yes undoubtedly the abbã_busoni himself replied count_of_monte_cristo and i am very glad you recognize me dear m_caderousse it proves you have a good memory for it must be about ten year since we last met
this calmness of abbã_busoni combined with his irony and boldness staggered m_caderousse the abbã the abbã murmured he clenching his fists and his teeth chattering so you would rob the count_of_monte_cristo continued the false abbã reverend sir murmured m_caderousse seeking to regain the window which the count pitilessly blockedâ reverend sir i donâ knowâ believe meâ i take my oathâ â a pane of glass out continued the count a dark lantern a bunch of false keys a secretaire half forcedâ it is tolerably evidentâ â m_caderousse was choking he looked around for some corner to hide in some way of escape come come continued the count i see you are still the same an assassin â reverend sir since you know everything you know it was not iâ it was la_carconte that was proved at the trial since i was only condemned to the galleys â is your time then expired since i find you in a fair way to return there â no reverend sir i have been liberated by someone â that someone has done society a great kindness â ah said m_caderousse i had promisedâ â and you are breaking your promise interrupted count_of_monte_cristo alas yes said m_caderousse very uneasily a bad relapse that will lead you if i mistake not to the place de grã ve so much the worse so much the worseâ diavolo as they say in my country â reverend sir i am impelledâ â every criminal says the same thing â povertyâ â pshaw said abbã_busoni disdainfully poverty may make a man beg steal a loaf of bread at a bakerâ door but not cause him to open a secretaire in a house_of_peers supposed to be inhabited
and when the jeweller johannes had just paid you 45 000 franc for the diamond i had given you and you killed him to get the diamond and the money both was that also poverty â pardon reverend sir said m_caderousse you have saved my life once save me again â that is but poor encouragement â are you alone reverend sir or have you there soldiers ready to seize me â i am alone said the abbã and i will again have pity on you and will let you escape at the risk of the fresh miseries my weakness may lead to if you tell me the truth â ah reverend sir cried m_caderousse clasping his hand and drawing nearer to count_of_monte_cristo i may indeed say you are my deliverer â you mean to say you have been freed from confinement â_yes that is true reverend sir â who was your liberator â an englishman â what was his name â lord_wilmore â i know him i shall know if you lie â ah reverend sir i tell you the simple truth â was this englishman protecting you â no not me but a young corsican my companion â what was this young corsicanâ name â m_benedetto â is that his christian name â he had no other he was a foundling â then this young man escaped with you â he did â in what way â we were working at saint mandrier near toulon do you know saint mandrier â i do â in the hour of rest between noon and one oâ clockâ â galley slaves having a nap after dinner we may well pity the poor fellows said the abbã nay said m_caderousse one canâ always workâ one is not a dog â so much the better for the dogs said count_of_monte_cristo
â while the rest slept then we went away a short distance we severed our fetters with a file the englishman had given us and swam away â and what is become of this m_benedetto â i donâ know â you ought to know â no in truth we parted at hyã res and to give more weight to his protestation m_caderousse advanced another step towards the abbã who remained motionless in his place as calm as ever and pursuing his interrogation you lie said the abbã_busoni with a tone of irresistible authority reverend sir â you lie this man is still your friend and you perhaps make use of him as your accomplice 40160m â_oh reverend sir â since you left toulon what have you lived on answer me â on what i could get â you lie repeated the abbã a third time with a still more imperative tone m_caderousse terrified looked at the count you have lived on the money he has given you â true said m_caderousse m_benedetto has become the son of a great lord â how can he be the son of a great lord â a natural son â and what is that great lordâ name â the count_of_monte_cristo the very same in whose house_of_peers we are â m_benedetto the countâ son replied count_of_monte_cristo astonished in his turn well i should think so since the count has found him a false fatherâ since the count gives him four thousand franc a month and leaves him 500 000 franc in his will â ah yes said the factitious abbã who began to understand and what name does the young man bear meanwhile â m_andrea_cavalcanti â is it then that young man whom my friend the count_of_monte_cristo has received into his house_of_peers and who is going to marry mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â exactly â and
you suffer that you wretch you who know his life and his crime â why should i stand in a comradeâ way said m_caderousse you are right it is not you who should apprise mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars it is i â do not do so reverend sir â why not â because you would bring us to ruin â and you think that to save such villains as you i will become an abettor of their plot an accomplice in their crimes â reverend sir said m_caderousse drawing still nearer i will expose all â to whom â to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â by heaven cried m_caderousse drawing from his waistcoat an open knife and striking the count in the breast you shall disclose nothing reverend sir to caderousseâ great astonishment the knife instead of piercing the countâ breast flew back blunted at the same moment the count seized with his left hand the assassinâ wrist and wrung it with such strength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers and m_caderousse uttered a cry of pain but the count disregarding his cry continued to wring the banditâ wrist until his arm being dislocated he fell first on his knees then flat on the floor the count then placed his foot on his head saying i know not what restrains me from crushing thy skull rascal â ah mercyâ mercy cried m_caderousse the count withdrew his foot 40162m rise said he m_caderousse rose what a wrist you have reverend sir said m_caderousse stroking his arm all bruised by the fleshy pincers which had held it what a wrist â silence god gives me strength to overcome a wild beast like you in the name of that god i act remember that wretch and to spare thee at this moment is still serving him â_oh said m_caderousse groaning with pain
â take this pen and paper and write what i dictate â i donâ know how to write reverend sir â you lie take this pen and write m_caderousse awed by the superior power of the abbã sat down and wrote sir the man whom you are receiving at your house_of_peers and to whom you intend to marry your daughter is a felon who escaped with me from confinement at toulon he was no 59 and i no 58 he was called m_benedetto but he is ignorant of his real name having never known his parents â sign it continued the count but would you ruin me â if i sought your ruin fool i should drag you to the first guard house_of_peers besides when that note is delivered in all probability you will have no more to fear sign it then m_caderousse signed it the address to monsieur_albert the baron mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars banker rue de la chaussã dâ antin â m_caderousse wrote the address the abbã took the note now said he that sufficesâ begone â which way â the way you came â you wish me to get out at that window â you got in very well â_oh you have some design against me reverend sir â idiot what design can i have â why then not let me out by the door â what would be the advantage of waking the porter â ah reverend sir tell me do you wish me dead â i wish what god wills â but swear that you will not strike me as i go down â cowardly fool â what do you intend doing with me â i ask you what can i do i have tried to make you a happy man and you have turned out a murderer â_oh monsieur_albert said m_caderousse make one more attemptâ try me once more â i will said the count
â listenâ you know if i may be relied on â_yes said m_caderousse if you arrive safely at homeâ â what have i to fear except from you â if you reach your home safely leave paris leave france and wherever you may be so long as you conduct yourself well i will send you a small annuity for if you return home safely thenâ â then asked m_caderousse shuddering 40164 â then i shall believe god has forgiven you and i will forgive you too â as true as i am a christian stammered m_caderousse you will make me die of fright â now begone said the count pointing to the window m_caderousse scarcely yet relying on this promise put his legs out of the window and stood on the ladder now go down said the abbã folding his arm understanding he had nothing more to fear from him m_caderousse began to go down then the count brought the taper to the window that it might be seen in the champs lysã es that a man was getting out of the window while another held a light what are you doing reverend sir suppose a watchman should pass and he blew out the light he then descended but it was only when he felt his foot touch the ground that he was satisfied of his safety count_of_monte_cristo returned to his bedroom and glancing rapidly from the garden to the street he saw first m_caderousse who after walking to the end of the garden fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part from where he came in the count then looking over into the street saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction and place himself against the angle of the wall where m_caderousse would come over
caderousse climbed the ladder slowly and looked over the coping to see if the street was quiet no one could be seen or heard the clock of the invalides struck one then m_caderousse sat astride the coping and drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall then he began to descend or rather to slide down by the two stanchions which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he was to the exercise but once started he could not stop in vain did he see a man start from the shadow when he was halfway downâ in vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the ground before he could defend himself that arm struck him so violently in the back that he let go the ladder crying help a second blow struck him almost immediately in the side and he fell calling help murder then as he rolled on the ground his adversary seized him by the hair and struck him a third blow in the chest this time m_caderousse endeavored to call again but he could only utter a groan and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds the assassin finding that he no longer cried out lifted his head up by the hair his eye were closed and the mouth was distorted the murderer supposing him dead let fall his head and disappeared then m_caderousse feeling that he was leaving him raised himself on his elbow and with a dying voice cried with great effort murder i am dying help reverend sir help this mournful appeal pierced the darkness the door of the back staircase opened then the side gate of the garden and ali_pasha_of_yanina and his master were on the spot with light chapter 83
the hand of god m_caderousse continued to call piteously help reverend sir help â what is the matter asked count_of_monte_cristo help cried m_caderousse i am murdered â we are here take courage â ah itâ all over you are come too lateâ you are come to see me die what blows what blood he fainted ali_pasha_of_yanina and his master conveyed the wounded man into a room count_of_monte_cristo motioned to ali_pasha_of_yanina to undress him and he then examined his dreadful wounds my god he exclaimed thy vengeance is sometimes delayed but only that it may fall the more effectually ali_pasha_of_yanina looked at his master for further instructions bring here immediately the kingâ attorney m_noirtier_de_villefort who life in the faubourg saint honorã as you pass the lodge wake the porter and send him for a surgeon ali_pasha_of_yanina obeyed leaving the abbã alone with m_caderousse who had not yet revived when the wretched man again opened his eye the count looked at him with a mournful expression of pity and his lip moved as if in prayer a surgeon reverend sirâ a surgeon said m_caderousse i have sent for one replied the abbã i know he cannot save my life but he may strengthen me to give my evidence â against whom â against my murderer â did you recognize him â_yes it was m_benedetto â the young corsican â himself â your comrade â_yes after giving me the plan of this house_of_peers doubtless hoping i should kill the count and he thus become his heir or that the count would kill me and i should be out of his way he waylaid me and has murdered me â i have also sent for the procureur â he will not come in time i feel my life fast ebbing â wait a moment said count_of_monte_cristo
he left the room and returned in five minute with a phial the dying manâ eye were all the time riveted on the door through which he hoped succor would arrive hasten reverend sir hasten i shall faint again count_of_monte_cristo approached and dropped on his purple lip three or four drops of the contents of the phial m_caderousse drew a deep breath â_oh said he that is life to me more more â two drops more would kill you replied the abbã â_oh send for someone to whom i can denounce the wretch â shall i write your deposition you can sign it â_yes yes said m_caderousse and his eye glistened at the thought of this posthumous revenge count_of_monte_cristo wrote i die murdered by the corsican m_benedetto my comrade in the galleys at toulon no 59 â quick quick said m_caderousse or i shall be unable to sign it count_of_monte_cristo gave the pen to m_caderousse who collected all his strength signed it and fell back on his bed saying you will relate all the rest reverend sir you will say he calls himself m_andrea_cavalcanti he lodges at the hã tel des princes oh i am dying he again fainted the abbã made him smell the contents of the phial and he again opened his eye his desire for revenge had not forsaken him ah you will tell all i have said will you not reverend sir â_yes and much more â what more will you say â i will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house_of_peers in the hope the count would kill you
i will say likewise he had apprised the count by a note of your intention and the count being absent i read the note and sat up to await you â and he will be guillotined will be not said m_caderousse promise me that and i will die with that hope â i will say continued the count that he followed and watched you the whole time and when he saw you leave the house_of_peers ran to the angle of the wall to conceal himself â did you see all that â remember my word if you return home safely i shall believe god has forgiven you and i will forgive you also â and you did not warn me cried m_caderousse raising himself on his elbows you knew i should be killed on leaving this house_of_peers and did not warn me 40168m no for i saw godâ justice placed in the hand of m_benedetto and should have thought it sacrilege to oppose the designs of providence â godâ justice speak not of it reverend sir if god were just you know how many would be punished who now escape â patience said the abbã in a tone which made the dying man shudder have patience m_caderousse looked at him with amazement besides said the abbã god is merciful to all as he has been to you he is first a father then a judge â do you then believe in god said m_caderousse had i been so unhappy as not to believe in him until now said count_of_monte_cristo i must believe on seeing you m_caderousse raised his clenched hand towards heaven
â listen said the abbã extending his hand over the wounded man as if to command him to believe this is what the god in whom on your death bed you refuse to believe has done for youâ he gave you health strength regular employment even friendsâ a life in fact which a man might enjoy with a calm conscience instead of improving these gifts rarely granted so abundantly this has been your courseâ you have given yourself up to sloth and drunkenness and in a fit of intoxication have ruined your best friend â help cried m_caderousse i require a surgeon not a priest perhaps i am not mortally woundedâ i may not die perhaps they can yet save my life â your wounds are so far mortal that without the three drops i gave you you would now be dead listen then â ah murmured m_caderousse what a strange priest you are you drive the dying to despair instead of consoling them â listen continued the abbã when you had betrayed your friend god began not to strike but to warn you poverty overtook you you had already passed half your life in coveting that which you might have honorably acquired and already you contemplated crime under the excuse of want when god worked a miracle in your behalf sending you by my hand a fortuneâ brilliant indeed for you who had never possessed any but this unexpected unhoped for unheard of fortune sufficed you no longer when you once possessed it you wished to double it and how by a murder
you succeeded and then god snatched it from you and brought you to justice â_it was not i who wished to kill the jew said m_caderousse â_it was la_carconte â_yes said count_of_monte_cristo and god i cannot say in justice for his justice would have slain you but god in his mercy spared your life â pardieu to transport me for life how merciful â you thought it a mercy then miserable wretch the coward who feared death rejoiced at perpetual disgrace for like all galley slaves you said i may escape from prison i cannot from the grave and you said truly the way was opened for you unexpectedly an englishman visited toulon who had vowed to rescue two man from infamy and his choice fell on you and your companion you received a second fortune money and tranquillity were restored to you and you who had been condemned to a felonâ life might live as other man then wretched creature then you tempted god a third time i have not enough you said when you had more than you before possessed and you committed a third crime without reason without excuse god is wearied he has punished you m_caderousse was fast sinking give me drink said he i thirstâ i burn count_of_monte_cristo gave him a glass of water and yet that villain m_benedetto will escape â no one i tell you will escape m_benedetto will be punished â then you too will be punished for you did not do your duty as a priestâ you should have prevented m_benedetto from killing me â i said the count with a smile which petrified the dying man when you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail which protected my breast
yet perhaps if i had found you humble and penitent i might have prevented m_benedetto from killing you but i found you proud and blood thirsty and i left you in the hand of god â i do not believe there is a god howled m_caderousse you do not believe it you lieâ you lie â silence said the abbã you will force the last drop of blood from your veins what you do not believe in god when he is striking you dead you will not believe in him who requires but a prayer a word a tear and he will forgive god who might have directed the assassinâ dagger so as to end your career in a moment has given you this quarter of an hour for repentance reflect then wretched man and repent â no said m_caderousse no i will not repent there is no god there is no providenceâ all comes by chance â there is a providence there is a god said count_of_monte_cristo of whom you are a striking proof as you lie in utter despair denying him while i stand before you rich happy safe and entreating that god in whom you endeavor not to believe while in your heart you still believe in him â but who are you then asked m_caderousse fixing his dying eye on the count look well at me said count_of_monte_cristo putting the light near his face well the abbã the abbã_busoni count_of_monte_cristo took off the wig which disfigured him and let fall his black hair which added so much to the beauty of his pallid features â_oh
said m_caderousse thunderstruck but for that black hair i should say you were the englishman lord_wilmore â i am neither the abbã_busoni nor lord_wilmore said count_of_monte_cristo think again do you not recollect me there was a magic effect in the countâ word which once more revived the exhausted powers of the miserable man â_yes indeed said he i think i have seen you and known you formerly â_yes m_caderousse you have seen me you knew me once â who then are you and why if you knew me do you let me die â because nothing can save you your wounds are mortal had it been possible to save you i should have considered it another proof of godâ mercy and i would again have endeavored to restore you i swear by my fatherâ tomb â by your fatherâ tomb said m_caderousse supported by a supernatural power and half raising himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all man hold sacred who then are you the count had watched the approach of death he knew this was the last struggle he approached the dying man and leaning over him with a calm and melancholy look he whispered i amâ i amâ â and his almost closed lip uttered a name so low that the count himself appeared afraid to hear it m_caderousse who had raised himself on his knees and stretched out his arm tried to draw back then clasping his hand and raising them with a desperate effort â_oh my god my god said he pardon me for having denied thee thou dost exist thou art indeed manâ father in heaven and his judge on earth my god my lord i have long despised thee
pardon me my god receive me oh my lord m_caderousse sighed deeply and fell back with a groan the blood no longer flowed from his wounds he was dead one said the count mysteriously his eye fixed on the corpse disfigured by so awful a death ten minute afterwards the surgeon and the procureur arrived the one accompanied by the porter the other by ali_pasha_of_yanina and were received by the abbã_busoni who was praying by the side of the corpse chapter 84 m_beauchamp the daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation throughout paris for the next fortnight the dying man had signed a deposition declaring m_benedetto to be the assassin the police had order to make the strictest search for the murderer caderousseâ knife dark lantern bunch of keys and clothing excepting the waistcoat which could not be found were deposited at the registry the corpse was conveyed to the morgue the count told everyone that this adventure had happened during his absence at auteuil and that he only knew what was related by the abbã_busoni who that evening by mere chance had requested to pass the night in his house_of_peers to examine some valuable books in his library monsieur_bertuccio alone turned pale whenever benedettoâ name was mentioned in his presence but there was no reason why anyone should notice his doing so m_noirtier_de_villefort being called on to prove the crime was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal cases
but three weeks had already passed and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars to the count m_andrea_cavalcanti it was expected that this wedding would shortly take place as the young man was received at the bankerâ as the betrothed letter had been despatched to m_andrea_cavalcanti as the countâ father who highly approved of the union regretted his inability to leave parma at that time and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres it was agreed that the three millions should be intrusted to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars to invest some person had warned the young man of the circumstances of his future father in law who had of late sustained repeated losses but with sublime disinterestedness and confidence the young man refused to listen or to express a single doubt to the baron the baron adored count m_andrea_cavalcanti not so mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with an instinctive hatred of matrimony she suffered andreaâ attentions in order to get rid of viscount_albert_de_morcerf but when m_andrea_cavalcanti urged his suit she betrayed an entire dislike to him the baron might possibly have perceived it but attributing it to a caprice feigned ignorance the delay demanded by m_beauchamp had nearly expired viscount_albert_de_morcerf appreciated the advice of count_of_monte_cristo to let thing die away of their own accord no one had taken up the remark about the general and no one had recognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of ali_pasha_of_yanina the noble count in the house_of_peers monsieur_albert however felt no less insulted the few lines which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult
besides the manner in which m_beauchamp had closed the conference left a bitter recollection in his heart he cherished the thought of the duel hoping to conceal its true cause even from his seconds m_beauchamp had not been seen since the day he visited monsieur_albert and those of whom the latter inquired always told him he was out on a journey which would detain him some day where he was no one knew one morning monsieur_albert was awakened by his valet de chambre who announced m_beauchamp monsieur_albert rubbed his eye ordered his servant to introduce him into the small smoking room on the ground floor dressed himself quickly and went down he found m_beauchamp pacing the room on perceiving him m_beauchamp stopped your arrival here without waiting my visit at your house_of_peers today look well sir said monsieur_albert tell me may i shake hand with you saying m_beauchamp acknowledge you have injured me and retain my friendship or must i simply propose to you a choice of arm â monsieur_albert said m_beauchamp with a look of sorrow which stupefied the young man let us first sit down and talk â rather sir before we sit down i must demand your answer â monsieur_albert said the journalist these are questions which it is difficult to answer â i will facilitate it by repeating the question will you or will you not retract â viscount_albert_de_morcerf it is not enough to answer yesâ or noâ to questions which concern the honor the social interest and the life of such a man as lieutenant gã nã ral the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf peer of france â what must then be done 40174m what i have done monsieur_albert
i reasoned thusâ money time and fatigue are nothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family probabilities will not suffice only facts will justify a deadly combat with a friend if i strike with the sword or discharge the contents of a pistol at man with whom for three year i have been on terms of intimacy i must at least know why i do so i must meet him with a heart at ease and that quiet conscience which a man needs when his own arm must save his life â well said viscount_albert_de_morcerf impatiently what does all this mean â_it means that i have just returned from ali_pasha_of_yanina â from ali_pasha_of_yanina â_yes â impossible â here is my passport examine the visaâ geneva milan venice trieste delvino ali_pasha_of_yanina will you believe the government of a republic a kingdom and an empire monsieur_albert cast his eye on the passport then raised them in astonishment to m_beauchamp you have been to ali_pasha_of_yanina said he monsieur_albert had you been a stranger a foreigner a simple lord like that englishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four month since and whom i killed to get rid of i should not have taken this trouble but i thought this mark of consideration due to you i took a week to go another to return four day of quarantine and forty eight hour to stay there that makes three weeks i returned last night and here i am â what circumlocution how long you are before you tell me what i most wish to know â because in truth albertâ â you hesitate â_yes i fear â you fear to acknowledge that your correspondent has deceived you oh no self love m_beauchamp acknowledge it m_beauchamp your courage cannot be doubted â not
so murmured the journalist on the contraryâ â monsieur_albert turned frightfully pale he endeavored to speak but the word died on his lip my friend said m_beauchamp in the most affectionate tone i should gladly make an apology but alas â â but what â the paragraph was correct my friend â what that french officerâ â â_yes â m_fernand_mondego â_yes â the traitor who surrendered the castle of the man in whose service he wasâ â pardon me my friend that man was your father monsieur_albert advanced furiously towards m_beauchamp but the latter restrained him more by a mild look than by his extended hand my friend said he here is a proof of it 40176m monsieur_albert opened the paper it was an attestation of four notable inhabitants of ali_pasha_of_yanina proving that colonel m_fernand_mondego in the service of ali_pasha_of_yanina tepelini had surrendered the castle for two million crowns the signatures were perfectly legal monsieur_albert tottered and fell overpowered in a chair it could no longer be doubted the family name was fully given after a momentâ mournful silence his heart overflowed and he gave way to a flood of tears m_beauchamp who had watched with sincere pity the young manâ paroxysm of grief approached him now monsieur_albert said he you understand meâ do you not i wished to see all and to judge of everything for myself hoping the explanation would be in your fatherâ favor and that i might do him justice
but on the contrary the particulars which are given prove that m_fernand_mondego raised by ali_pasha_of_yanina to the rank of governor general is no other than count m_fernand_mondego of viscount_albert_de_morcerf then recollecting the honor you had done me in admitting me to your friendship i hastened to you monsieur_albert still extended on the chair covered his face with both hand as if to prevent the light from reaching him i hastened to you continued m_beauchamp to tell you monsieur_albert that in this changing age the faults of a father cannot revert upon his child few have passed through this revolutionary period in the midst of which we were born without some stain of infamy or blood to soil the uniform of the soldier or the gown of the magistrate now i have these proofs monsieur_albert and i am in your confidence no human power can force me to a duel which your own conscience would reproach you with as criminal but i come to offer you what you can no longer demand of me do you wish these proofs these attestations which i alone possess to be destroyed do you wish this frightful secret to remain with us confided to me it shall never escape my lip say monsieur_albert my friend do you wish it monsieur_albert threw himself on beauchampâ neck ah noble fellow cried he take these said m_beauchamp presenting the paper to monsieur_albert albert seized them with a convulsive hand tore them in pieces and trembling lest the least vestige should escape and one day appear to confront him he approached the wax light always kept burning for cigars and burned every fragment dear excellent friend murmured monsieur_albert still burning the paper
â let all be forgotten as a sorrowful dream said m_beauchamp let it vanish as the last sparks from the blackened paper and disappear as the smoke from those silent ashes â_yes yes said monsieur_albert and may there remain only the eternal friendship which i promised to my deliverer which shall be transmitted to our childrenâ child and shall always remind me that i owe my life and the honor of my name to you for had this been known oh m_beauchamp i should have destroyed myself or no my poor mother i could not have killed her by the same blow i should have fled from my country â dear monsieur_albert said m_beauchamp but this sudden and factitious joy soon forsook the young man and was succeeded by a still greater grief well said m_beauchamp what still oppresses you my friend 40178m i am broken hearted said monsieur_albert listen m_beauchamp i cannot thus in a moment relinquish the respect the confidence and pride with which a fatherâ untarnished name inspires a son oh m_beauchamp beauchamp how shall i now approach mine shall i draw back my forehead from his embrace or withhold my hand from his i am the most wretched of man ah my mother my poor mother said monsieur_albert gazing through his tears at his motherâ portrait if you know this how much must you suffer â come said m_beauchamp taking both his hand take courage my friend â but how came that first note to be inserted in your journal some unknown enemyâ an invisible foeâ has done this â the more must you fortify yourself monsieur_albert let no trace of emotion be visible on your countenance bear your grief as the cloud bears within it ruin and deathâ a fatal secret known only when the storm bursts go my friend reserve your strength for the moment
when the crash shall come 40179m you think then all is not over yet said monsieur_albert horror stricken i think nothing my friend but all thing are possible by the wayâ â what said monsieur_albert seeing that m_beauchamp hesitated are you going to marry mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â why do you ask me now â because the rupture or fulfilment of this engagement is connected with the person of whom we were speaking â how said monsieur_albert whose brow reddened you think danglarsâ â i ask you only how your engagement stands pray put no construction on my word i do not mean they should convey and give them no undue weight â no said monsieur_albert the engagement is broken off â well said m_beauchamp then seeing the young man was about to relapse into melancholy let us go out monsieur_albert said he a ride in the wood in the phaeton or on horseback will refresh you we will then return to breakfast and you shall attend to your affairs and i to mine â willingly said monsieur_albert but let us walk i think a little exertion would do me good the two friend walked out on the fortress when they arrived at the madeleine since we are out said m_beauchamp let us call on de count_of_monte_cristo he is admirably adapted to revive oneâ spirits because he never interrogates and in my opinion those who ask no questions are the best comforters â gladly said monsieur_albert let us callâ i love him chapter 85 the journey count_of_monte_cristo uttered a joyful exclamation on seeing the young man together ah ha said he i hope all is over explained and settled â_yes
â said m_beauchamp the absurd reports have died away and should they be renewed i would be the first to oppose them so let us speak no more of it â monsieur_albert will tell you replied the count that i gave him the same advice look added he i am finishing the most execrable morningâ work â what is it said monsieur_albert arranging your paper apparently â my paper thank god no my paper are all in capital order because i have none but cavalcantiâ â m cavalcantiâ â asked m_beauchamp â_yes do you not know that this is a young man whom the count is introducing said viscount_albert_de_morcerf let us not misunderstand each other replied count_of_monte_cristo i introduce no one and certainly not m_andrea_cavalcanti â and who said monsieur_albert with a forced smile is to marry mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars instead of me which grieves me cruelly â what m_andrea_cavalcanti is going to marry mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars asked m_beauchamp certainly do you come from the end of the world said count_of_monte_cristo you a journalist the husband of renown it is the talk of all paris â and you count have made this match asked m_beauchamp i silence purveyor of gossip do not spread that report i make a match no you do not know me i have done all in my power to oppose it â ah i understand said m_beauchamp on our friend albertâ account â on my account said the young man â_oh no indeed the count will do me the justice to assert that i have on the contrary always entreated him to break off my engagement and happily it is ended
the count pretends i have not him to thank so be itâ i will erect an altar deo ignoto â listen said count_of_monte_cristo i have had little to do with it for i am at variance both with the father in law and the young man there is only mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who appears but little charmed with the thoughts of matrimony and who seeing how little i was disposed to persuade her to renounce her dear liberty retains any affection for me â and do you say this wedding is at hand â_oh yes in spite of all i could say i do not know the young man he is said to be of good family and rich but i never trust to vague assertions i have warned mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars of it till i am tired but he is fascinated with his luccanese i have even informed him of a circumstance i consider very serious the young man was either charmed by his nurse stolen by gypsies or lost by his tutor i scarcely know which but i do know his father lost sight of him for more than ten year what he did during these ten year god only knows well all that was useless they have commissioned me to write to the major to demand paper and here they are i send them but like pilateâ washing my hand â and what does mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars dâ armilly say to you for robbing her of her pupil â_oh well i donâ know but i understand that she is going to italy madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars asked me for letter of recommendation for the impresari i gave her a few lines for the director of the valle theatre who is under some obligation to me but what is the matter monsieur_albert
you look dull are you after all unconsciously in love with mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â i am not aware of it said monsieur_albert smiling sorrowfully m_beauchamp turned to look at some paintings but continued count_of_monte_cristo you are not in your usual spirits â i have a dreadful headache said monsieur_albert well my dear viscount said count_of_monte_cristo i have an infallible remedy to propose to you â what is that asked the young man a change â indeed said monsieur_albert â_yes and as i am just now excessively annoyed i shall go from home shall we go together â you annoyed count said m_beauchamp and by what â ah you think very lightly of it i should like to see you with a brief preparing in your house_of_peers â what brief â the one m_noirtier_de_villefort is preparing against my amiable assassinâ some brigand escaped from the gallows apparently â true said m_beauchamp i saw it in the paper who is this m_caderousse â some provenã al it appears m_noirtier_de_villefort heard of him at marseilles and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars recollects having seen him consequently the procureur is very active in the affair and the prefect of police very much interested and thanks to that interest for which i am very grateful they send me all the robbers of paris and the neighborhood under pretence of their being caderousseâ murderers so that in three month if this continues every robber and assassin in france will have the plan of my house_of_peers at his fingersâ end i am resolved to desert them and go to some remote corner of the earth and shall be happy if you will accompany me viscount â willingly
â then it is settled â_yes but where â i have told you where the air is pure where every sound soothes where one is sure to be humbled however proud may be his nature i love that humiliation i who am master of the universe as was augustus â but where are you really going â to sea viscount you know i am a sailor i was rocked when an infant in the arm of old ocean and on the bosom of the beautiful amphitrite i have sported with the green mantle of the one and the azure robe of the other i love the sea as a mistress and pine if i do not often see her â let us go count â to sea â_yes â you accept my proposal â i do â well viscount there will be in my courtyard this evening a good travelling britzka with four post horse in which one may rest as in a bed m_beauchamp it holds four very well will you accompany us â thank you i have just returned from sea â what you have been to sea â_yes i have just made a little excursion to the borromean islands18 â what of that come with us said monsieur_albert no dear viscount_albert_de_morcerf you know i only refuse when the thing is impossible besides it is important added he in a low tone that i should remain in paris just now to watch the paper â ah you are a good and an excellent friend said monsieur_albert â_yes you are right watch watch m_beauchamp and try to discover the enemy who made this disclosure monsieur_albert and m_beauchamp parted the last pressure of their hand expressing what their tongues could not before a stranger m_beauchamp is a worthy fellow said count_of_monte_cristo when the journalist was gone
â is he not monsieur_albert â_yes and a sincere friend i love him devotedly but now we are alone although it is immaterial to me where are we going â into normandy if you like â delightful shall we be quite retired have no society no neighbors â our companions will be riding horse dogs to hunt with and a fishing boat â exactly what i wish for i will apprise my mother of my intention and return to you â but shall you be allowed to go into normandy â i may go where i please â_yes i am aware you may go alone since i once met you in italyâ but to accompany the mysterious count_of_monte_cristo â you forget count that i have often told you of the deep interest my mother takes in you â woman is fickle said francis i woman is like a wave of the sea said shakespeare both the great king and the great poet ought to have known womanâ nature well â womanâ yes my mother is not woman but a woman â as i am only a humble foreigner you must pardon me if i do not understand all the subtle refinements of your language â what i mean to say is that my mother is not quick to give her confidence but when she does she never changes â ah yes indeed said count_of_monte_cristo with a sigh and do you think she is in the least interested in me â i repeat it you must really be a very strange and superior man for my mother is so absorbed by the interest you have excited that when i am with her she speaks of no one else â and does she try to make you dislike me â on the contrary she often says
â viscount_albert_de_morcerf i believe the count has a noble nature try to gain his esteem â indeed said count_of_monte_cristo sighing you see then said monsieur_albert that instead of opposing she will encourage me â adieu then until five oâ clock be punctual and we shall arrive at twelve or one â at trã port â_yes or in the neighborhood â but can we travel forty eight leagues in eight hour â easily said count_of_monte_cristo you are certainly a prodigy you will soon not only surpass the railway which would not be very difficult in france but even the telegraph â but viscount since we cannot perform the journey in less than seven or eight hour do not keep me waiting â do not fear i have little to prepare count_of_monte_cristo smiled as he nodded to monsieur_albert then remained a moment absorbed in deep meditation but passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his reverie he rang the bell twice and monsieur_bertuccio entered monsieur_bertuccio said he i intend going this evening to normandy instead of tomorrow or the next day you will have sufficient time before five oâ clock despatch a messenger to apprise the grooms at the first station de viscount_albert_de_morcerf will accompany me monsieur_bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to pontoise to say the travelling carriage would arrive at six oâ clock from pontoise another express was sent to the next stage and in six hour all the horse stationed on the road were ready before his departure the count went to haydã eâ apartments told her his intention and resigned everything to her care monsieur_albert was punctual the journey soon became interesting from its rapidity of which viscount_albert_de_morcerf had formed no previous idea
â truly said count_of_monte_cristo with your post horse going at the rate of two leagues an hour and that absurd law that one traveller shall not pass another without permission so that an invalid or ill tempered traveller may detain those who are well and active it is impossible to move i escape this annoyance by travelling with my own postilion and horse do i not ali_pasha_of_yanina the count put his head out of the window and whistled and the horse appeared to fly the carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the pavement and everyone turned to notice the dazzling meteor ali_pasha_of_yanina smiling repeated the sound grasped the reins with a firm hand and spurred his horse whose beautiful manes floated in the breeze this child of the desert was in his element and with his black face and sparkling eye appeared in the cloud of dust he raised like the genius of the simoom and the god of the hurricane i never knew till now the delight of speed said viscount_albert_de_morcerf and the last cloud disappeared from his brow but where the devil do you get such horse are they made to order â precisely said the count six year since i bought a horse in hungary remarkable for its swiftness the thirty two that we shall use tonight are its progeny they are all entirely black with the exception of a star upon the forehead â that is perfectly admirable but what do you do count with all these horse â you see i travel with them â but you are not always travelling â when i no longer require them monsieur_bertuccio will sell them and he expects to realize thirty or forty thousand franc by the sale â but no monarch in europe will be wealthy enough to purchase them
â then he will sell them to some eastern vizier who will empty his coffers to purchase them and refill them by applying the bastinado to his subjects â count may i suggest one idea to you â certainly â_it is that next to you monsieur_bertuccio must be the richest gentleman in europe â you are mistaken viscount i believe he has not a franc in his possession â then he must be a wonder my dear count if you tell me many more marvellous thing i warn you i shall not believe them â i countenance nothing that is marvellous monsieur_albert tell me why does a steward rob his master â because i suppose it is his nature to do so for the love of robbing â you are mistaken it is because he has a wife and family and ambitious desires for himself and them also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation and wishes to provide for the future now monsieur_bertuccio is alone in the world he uses my property without accounting for the use he makes of it he is sure never to leave my service â why â because i should never get a better â probabilities are deceptive â but i deal in certainties he is the best servant over whom one has the power of life and death â do you possess that right over monsieur_bertuccio â_yes there are word which close a conversation with an iron door such was the countâ â_yes the whole journey was performed with equal rapidity the thirty two horse dispersed over seven stages brought them to their destination in eight hour at midnight they arrived at the gate of a beautiful park the porter was in attendance he had been apprised by the groom of the last stage of the countâ approach
at half past two in the morning viscount_albert_de_morcerf was conducted to his apartments where a bath and supper were prepared the servant who had travelled at the back of the carriage waited on him monsieur_baptistin who rode in front attended the count monsieur_albert bathed took his supper and went to bed all night he was lulled by the melancholy noise of the surf on rising he went to his window which opened on a terrace having the sea in front and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small forest in a creek lay a little sloop with a narrow keel and high masts bearing on its flag the count_of_monte_cristo arm which were a mountain or on a sea azure with a cross gules in chief which might be an allusion to his name that recalled calvary the mount rendered by our lordâ passion more precious than gold and to the degrading cross which his blood had rendered holy or it might be some personal remembrance of suffering and regeneration buried in the night of this mysterious personageâ pas life around the schooner lay a number of small fishing boats belonging to the fishermen of the neighboring village like humble subjects awaiting order from their queen there as in every spot where count_of_monte_cristo stopped if but for two day luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost ease monsieur_albert found in his anteroom two guns with all the accoutrements for hunting a lofty room on the ground floor containing all the ingenious instruments the englishâ eminent in piscatory pursuits since they are patient and sluggishâ have invented for fishing the day passed in pursuing those exercises in which count_of_monte_cristo excelled
they killed a dozen pheasants in the park as many trout in the stream dined in a summer house_of_peers overlooking the ocean and took tea in the library towards the evening of the third day monsieur_albert completely exhausted with the exercise which invigorated count_of_monte_cristo was sleeping in an armchair near the window while the count was designing with his architect the plan of a conservatory in his house_of_peers when the sound of a horse at full speed on the high road made monsieur_albert look up he was disagreeably surprised to see his own valet de chambre whom he had not brought that he might not inconvenience count_of_monte_cristo 40188m florentin here cried he starting up is my mother ill and he hastened to the door count_of_monte_cristo watched and saw him approach the valet who drew a small sealed parcel from his pocket containing a newspaper and a letter from whom is this said he eagerly from m_beauchamp replied florentin did he send you â_yes sir he sent for me to his house_of_peers gave me money for my journey procured a horse and made me promise not to stop till i had reached you i have come in fifteen hour monsieur_albert opened the letter with fear uttered a shriek on reading the first line and seized the paper his sight was dimmed his legs sank under him and he would have fallen had not florentin supported him poor young man said count_of_monte_cristo in a low voice â_it is then true that the sin of the father shall fall on the child to the third and fourth generation meanwhile monsieur_albert had revived and continuing to read he threw back his head saying florentin is your horse fit to return immediately â_it is a poor lame post horse â in
what state was the house_of_peers when you left â all was quiet but on returning from beauchampâ i found madame in tears she had sent for me to know when you would return i told her my order from m_beauchamp she first extended her arm to prevent me but after a momentâ reflection â_yes go florentin said she and may he come quickly â â_yes my mother said monsieur_albert i will return and woe to the infamous wretch but first of all i must get there he went back to the room where he had left count_of_monte_cristo five minute had sufficed to make a complete transformation in his appearance his voice had become rough and hoarse his face was furrowed with wrinkles his eye burned under the blue veined lids and he tottered like a drunken man count said he i thank you for your hospitality which i would gladly have enjoyed longer but i must return to paris â what has happened â a great misfortune more important to me than life donâ question me i beg of you but lend me a horse â my stables are at your command viscount but you will kill yourself by riding on horseback take a post chaise or a carriage â no it would delay me and i need the fatigue you warn me of it will do me good monsieur_albert reeled as if he had been shot and fell on a chair near the door count_of_monte_cristo did not see this second manifestation of physical exhaustion he was at the window calling ali_pasha_of_yanina a horse for de morcerfâ quick he is in a hurry 40190m these word restored monsieur_albert he darted from the room followed by the count thank you cried he throwing himself on his horse return as soon as you can florentin
must i use any password to procure a horse â only dismount another will be immediately saddled monsieur_albert hesitated a moment you may think my departure strange and foolish said the young man you do not know how a paragraph in a newspaper may exasperate one read that said he when i am gone that you may not be witness of my anger while the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus and shot away with the rapidity of an arrow the count watched him with a feeling of compassion and when he had completely disappeared read as follows the french officer in the service of ali_pasha_of_yanina alluded to three weeks since in lâ impartial who not only surrendered the castle of ali_pasha_of_yanina but sold his benefactor to the turks styled himself truly at that time m_fernand_mondego as our esteemed contemporary states but he has since added to his christian name a title of nobility and a family name he now calls himself the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf and ranks among the peers thus the terrible secret which m_beauchamp had so generously destroyed appeared again like an armed phantom and another paper deriving its information from some malicious source had published two day after albertâ departure for normandy the few lines which had rendered the unfortunate young man almost crazy chapter 86 the trial at eight oâ clock in the morning monsieur_albert had arrived at beauchampâ door the valet de chambre had received order to usher him in at once m_beauchamp was in his bath here i am monsieur_albert said
â well my poor friend replied m_beauchamp i expected you â i need not say i think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that painful circumstance your having sent for me is another proof of your affection so without losing time tell me have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds â i think i have some clew â but first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot m_beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man who was overwhelmed with shame and grief the following facts two day previously the article had appeared in another paper besides lâ impartial and what was more serious one that was well known as a government paper m_beauchamp was breakfasting when he read the paragraph he sent immediately for a cabriolet and hastened to the publisherâ office although professing diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the other paper beauchampâ as it sometimes we may say often happensâ was his intimate friend the editor was reading with apparent delight a leading article in the same paper on beet sugar probably a composition of his own ah pardieu said m_beauchamp with the paper in your hand my friend i need not tell you the cause of my visit â are you interested in the sugar question asked the editor of the ministerial paper no replied m_beauchamp i have not considered the question a totally different subject interests me â what is it â the article relative to viscount_albert_de_morcerf â indeed is it not a curious affair â so
curious that i think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of character â not at all we have received with the information all the requisite proofs and we are quite sure de viscount_albert_de_morcerf will not raise his voice against us besides it is rendering a service to oneâ country to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on them m_beauchamp was thunderstruck who then has so correctly informed you asked he for my paper which gave the first information on the subject has been obliged to stop for want of proof and yet we are more interested than you in exposing de viscount_albert_de_morcerf as he is a peer of france and we are of the opposition â_oh that is very simple we have not sought to scandalize this news was brought to us a man arrived yesterday from ali_pasha_of_yanina bringing a formidable array of documents and when we hesitated to publish the accusatory article he told us it should be inserted in some other paper m_beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit and left the office to despatch a courier to viscount_albert_de_morcerf but he had been unable to send to monsieur_albert the following particulars as the events had transpired after the messengerâ departure namely that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the house_of_peers among the usually calm members of that dignified assembly everyone had arrived almost before the usual hour and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract the attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious colleagues some were perusing the article others making comments and recalling circumstances which substantiated the charges still more the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf was no favorite with his colleagues
like all upstarts he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his position the true nobility laughed at him the talented repelled him and the honorable instinctively despised him he was in fact in the unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice the finger of god once pointed at him everyone was prepared to raise the hue and cry the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf alone was ignorant of the news he did not take in the paper containing the defamatory article and had passed the morning in writing letter and in trying a horse he arrived at his usual hour with a proud look and insolent demeanor he alighted passed through the corridors and entered the house_of_peers without observing the hesitation of the door keepers or the coolness of his colleagues 40194m business had already been going on for half an hour when he entered everyone held the accusing paper but as usual no one liked to take upon himself the responsibility of the attack at length an honorable peer morcerfâ acknowledged enemy ascended the tribune with that solemnity which announced that the expected moment had arrived there was an impressive silence viscount_albert_de_morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency the count did not notice the introduction in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided attention of the house_of_peers but at the mention of ali_pasha_of_yanina and colonel m_fernand_mondego he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eye upon him moral wounds have this peculiarity they may be hidden but they never close always painful always ready to bleed when touched they remain fresh and open in the heart
the article having been read during the painful hush that followed a universal shudder pervaded the assembly and immediately the closest attention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks he stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case it was the honor of de viscount_albert_de_morcerf and that of the whole house_of_peers he proposed to defend by provoking a debate on personal questions which are always such painful themes of discussion he concluded by calling for an investigation which might dispose of the calumnious report before it had time to spread and restore de viscount_albert_de_morcerf to the position he had long held in public opinion viscount_albert_de_morcerf was so completely overwhelmed by this great and unexpected calamity that he could scarcely stammer a few word as he looked around on the assembly this timidity which might proceed from the astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt conciliated some in his favor for man who are truly generous are always ready to compassionate when the misfortune of their enemy surpasses the limits of their hatred the president put it to the vote and it was decided that the investigation should take place the count was asked what time he required to prepare his defence morcerfâ courage had revived when he found himself alive after this horrible blow my lords answered he â_it is not by time i could repel the attack made on me by enemies unknown to me and doubtless hidden in obscurity it is immediately and by a thunderbolt that i must repel the flash of lightning which for a moment startled me oh that i could instead of taking up this defence shed my last drop of blood to prove to my noble colleagues that i am their equal in worth
these word made a favorable impression on behalf of the accused i demand then that the examination shall take place as soon as possible and i will furnish the house_of_peers with all necessary information â what day do you fix asked the president today i am at your service replied the count the president rang the bell does the house_of_peers approve that the examination should take place today 40196m â_yes was the unanimous answer a committee of twelve members was chosen to examine the proofs brought forward by viscount_albert_de_morcerf the investigation would begin at eight oâ clock that evening in the committee room and if postponement were necessary the proceedings would be resumed each evening at the same hour viscount_albert_de_morcerf asked leave to retire he had to collect the documents he had long been preparing against this storm which his sagacity had foreseen m_beauchamp related to the young man all the facts we have just narrated his story however had over ours all the advantage of the animation of living thing over the coldness of dead thing monsieur_albert listened trembling now with hope then with anger and then again with shame for from beauchampâ confidence he knew his father was guilty and he asked himself how since he was guilty he could prove his innocence m_beauchamp hesitated to continue his narrative what next asked monsieur_albert what next my friend you impose a painful task on me must you know all â absolutely and rather from your lip than anotherâ â muster up all your courage then for never have you required it more monsieur_albert passed his hand over his forehead as if to try his strength as a man who is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends his sword he thought himself strong enough for he mistook fever for energy
â go on said he the evening arrived all paris was in expectation many said your father had only to show himself to crush the charge against him many others said he would not appear while some asserted that they had seen him start for brussels and others went to the police office to inquire if he had taken out a passport i used all my influence with one of the committee a young peer of my acquaintance to get admission to one of the galleries he called for me at seven oâ clock and before anyone had arrived asked one of the door keepers to place me in a box i was concealed by a column and might witness the whole of the terrible scene which was about to take place at eight oâ clock all were in their place and de viscount_albert_de_morcerf entered at the last stroke he held some paper in his hand his countenance was calm and his step firm and he was dressed with great care in his military uniform which was buttoned completely up to the chin his presence produced a good effect the committee was made up of liberals several of whom came forward to shake hand with him monsieur_albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars but gratitude mingled with his sorrow he would gladly have embraced those who had given his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so powerfully attacked at this moment one of the door keepers brought in a letter for the president you are at liberty to speak de viscount_albert_de_morcerf said the president as he unsealed the letter and the count began his defence i assure you monsieur_albert in a most eloquent and skilful manner
he produced documents proving that the vizier of ali_pasha_of_yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor he produced the ring his mark of authority with which ali_pasha_of_yanina generally sealed his letter and which the latter had given him that he might on his return at any hour of the day or night gain access to the presence even in the harem unfortunately the negotiation failed and when he returned to defend his benefactor he was dead but said the count so great was ali_pasha_of_yanina pashaâ confidence that on his death bed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care â monsieur_albert started on hearing these word the history of haydã_e recurred to him and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring and the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave and what effect did this discourse produce anxiously inquired monsieur_albert i acknowledge it affected me and indeed all the committee also said m_beauchamp meanwhile the president carelessly opened the letter which had been brought to him but the first lines aroused his attention he read them again and again and fixing his eye on de viscount_albert_de_morcerf count said he you have said that the vizier of ali_pasha_of_yanina confided his wife and daughter to your care â â_yes sir replied viscount_albert_de_morcerf but in that like all the rest misfortune pursued me on my return vasiliki and her daughter haydã_e had disappeared â did you know them â my intimacy with the pasha and his unlimited confidence had gained me an introduction to them and i had seen them above twenty time â have you any idea what became of them â â_yes sir
i heard they had fallen victims to their sorrow and perhaps to their poverty i was not rich my life was in constant danger i could not seek them to my great regret the president frowned imperceptibly gentlemen said he you have heard the comte de morcerfâ defence can you sir produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have asserted â alas no monsieur_albert replied the count all those who surrounded the vizier or who knew me at his court are either dead or gone away i know not where i believe that i alone of all my countrymen survived that dreadful war i have only the letter of ali_pasha_of_yanina tepelini which i have placed before you the ring a token of his good will which is here and lastly the most convincing proof i can offer after an anonymous attack and that is the absence of any witness against my veracity and the purity of my military life â a murmur of approbation ran through the assembly and at this moment monsieur_albert had nothing more transpired your fatherâ cause had been gained it only remained to put it to the vote when the president resumed gentlemen and you monsieur_albert you will not be displeased i presume to listen to one who calls himself a very important witness and who has just presented himself he is doubtless come to prove the perfect innocence of our colleague here is a letter i have just received on the subject shall it be read or shall it be passed over and shall we take no notice of this incident m de viscount_albert_de_morcerf turned pale and clenched his hand on the paper he held the committee decided to hear the letter the count was thoughtful and silent the president read â mr
president i can furnish the committee of inquiry into the conduct of the lieutenant general the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf in epirus and in macedonia with important particulars â the president paused and the count turned pale the president looked at his auditors proceed was heard on all side the president resumed â i was on the spot at the death of ali_pasha_of_yanina i was present during his last moment i know what is become of vasiliki and haydã_e i am at the command of the committee and even claim the honor of being heard i shall be in the lobby when this note is delivered to you â and who is this witness or rather this enemy asked the count in a tone in which there was a visible alteration we shall know sir replied the president is the committee willing to hear this witness â â_yes yes they all said at once the door keeper was called is there anyone in the lobby said the president â_yes sir â who is it â a woman accompanied by a servant everyone looked at his neighbor bring her in said the president five minute after the door keeper again appeared all eye were fixed on the door and i said m_beauchamp shared the general expectation and anxiety behind the door keeper walked a woman enveloped in a large veil which completely concealed her it was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was all the president requested her to throw aside her veil and it was then seen that she was dressed in the grecian costume and was remarkably beautiful â ah said monsieur_albert â_it was she â who â haydã_e â who told you that â alas i guess it but go on m_beauchamp you see i am calm and strong
and yet we must be drawing near the disclosure â de viscount_albert_de_morcerf continued m_beauchamp looked at this woman with surprise and terror her lip were about to pass his sentence of life or death to the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious that the interest they had felt for the countâ safety became now quite a secondary matter the president himself advanced to place a seat for the young lady but she declined availing herself of it as for the count he had fallen on his chair it was evident that his legs refused to support him â madame said the president you have engaged to furnish the committee with some important particulars respecting the affair at ali_pasha_of_yanina and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the event â i was indeed said the stranger with a tone of sweet melancholy and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the east â but allow me to say that you must have been very young then â i was four year old but as those events deeply concerned me not a single detail has escaped my memory â in what manner could these events concern you and who are you that they should have made so deep an impression on you â on them depended my fatherâ life replied she i am haydã_e the daughter of ali_pasha_of_yanina tepelini ali_pasha_of_yanina and of vasiliki his beloved wife 40202m the blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the cheeks of the young woman the brilliancy of her eye and her highly important communication produced an indescribable effect on the assembly as for the count he could not have been more overwhelmed if a thunderbolt had fallen at his foot and opened an immense gulf before him
â madame replied the president bowing with profound respect allow me to ask one question it shall be the last can you prove the authenticity of what you have now stated â i can sir said haydã_e drawing from under her veil a satin satchel highly perfumed for here is the register of my birth signed by my father and his principal officers and that of my baptism my father having consented to my being brought up in my motherâ faith this latter has been sealed by the grand primate of macedonia and epirus and lastly and perhaps the most important the record of the sale of my person and that of my mother to the armenian merchant el kobbir by the french officer who in his infamous bargain with the porte had reserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his benefactor whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand franc a greenish pallor spread over the countâ cheeks and his eye became bloodshot at these terrible imputations which were listened to by the assembly with ominous silence haydã_e still calm but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger of another would have been handed to the president the record of her sale written in arabic it had been supposed some of the paper might be in the arabian romaic or turkish language and the interpreter of the house_of_peers was in attendance one of the noble peers who was familiar with the arabic language having studied it during the famous egyptian campaign followed with his eye as the translator read aloud
â i el kobbir a slave merchant and purveyor of the harem of his highness acknowledge having received for transmission to the sublime emperor from the french lord the count_of_monte_cristo an emerald valued at eight hundred thousand franc as the ransom of a young christian slave of eleven year of age named haydã_e the acknowledged daughter of the late lord ali_pasha_of_yanina tepelini ali_pasha_of_yanina and of vasiliki his favorite she having been sold to me seven year previously with her mother who had died on arriving at constantinople by a french colonel in the service of the vizier ali_pasha_of_yanina tepelini named m_fernand_mondego the above mentioned purchase was made on his highnessâ account whose mandate i had for the sum of four hundred thousand franc â given at constantinople by authority of his highness in the year 1247 of the hegira â signed el kobbir â that this record should have all due authority it shall bear the imperial seal which the vendor is bound to have affixed to it â near the merchantâ signature there was indeed the seal of the sublime emperor a dreadful silence followed the reading of this document the count could only stare and his gaze fixed as if unconsciously on haydã_e seemed one of fire and blood madame said the president may reference be made to the count_of_monte_cristo who is now i believe in paris â sir replied haydã_e the count_of_monte_cristo my foster father has been in normandy the last three day â who then has counselled you to take this step one for which the court is deeply indebted to you and which is perfectly natural considering your birth and your misfortunes â sir replied haydã_e i have been led to take this step from a feeling of respect and grief
although a christian may god forgive me i have always sought to revenge my illustrious father since i set my foot in france and knew the traitor lived in paris i have watched carefully i live retired in the house_of_peers of my noble protector but i do it from choice i love retirement and silence because i can live with my thoughts and recollections of past day but the count_of_monte_cristo surrounds me with every paternal care and i am ignorant of nothing which passes in the world i learn all in the silence of my apartments for instance i see all the newspapers every periodical as well as every new piece of music and by thus watching the course of the life of others i learned what had transpired this morning in the house_of_peers and what was to take place this evening then i wrote 40204m â then remarked the president the count_of_monte_cristo knows nothing of your present proceedings â he is quite unaware of them and i have but one fear which is that he should disapprove of what i have done but it is a glorious day for me continued the young girl raising her ardent gaze to heaven that on which i find at last an opportunity of avenging my father â the count had not uttered one word the whole of this time his colleagues looked at him and doubtless pitied his prospects blighted under the perfumed breath of a woman his misery was depicted in sinister lines on his countenance m de viscount_albert_de_morcerf said the president do you recognize this lady as the daughter of ali_pasha_of_yanina tepelini ali_pasha_of_yanina â no said viscount_albert_de_morcerf attempting to rise â_it is a base plot contrived by my enemies
haydã whose eye had been fixed on the door as if expecting someone turned hastily and seeing the count standing shrieked you do not know me said she well i fortunately recognize you you are m_fernand_mondego the french officer who led the troops of my noble father it is you who surrendered the castle of ali_pasha_of_yanina it is you who sent by him to constantinople to treat with the emperor for the life or death of your benefactor brought back a false mandate granting full pardon it is you who with that mandate obtained the pashaâ ring which gave you authority over selim the fire keeper it is you who stabbed selim it is you who sold us my mother and me to the merchant el kobbir assassin assassin assassin you have still on your brow your masterâ blood look gentlemen all â these word had been pronounced with such enthusiasm and evident truth that every eye was fixed on the countâ forehead and he himself passed his hand across it as if he felt aliâ blood still lingering there you positively recognize de viscount_albert_de_morcerf as the officer m_fernand_mondego â indeed i do cried haydã_e â_oh my mother it was you who said you were free you had a beloved father you were destined to be almost a queen look well at that man it is he who raised your fatherâ head on the point of a spear it is he who sold us it is he who forsook us look well at his right hand on which he has a large wound if you forgot his features you would know him by that hand into which fell one by one the gold pieces of the merchant el kobbir i know him ah let him say now if he does not recognize me
each word fell like a dagger on viscount_albert_de_morcerf and deprived him of a portion of his energy as she uttered the last he hid his mutilated hand hastily in his bosom and fell back on his seat overwhelmed by wretchedness and despair this scene completely changed the opinion of the assembly respecting the accused count â count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf said the president do not allow yourself to be cast down answer the justice of the court is supreme and impartial as that of god it will not suffer you to be trampled on by your enemies without giving you an opportunity of defending yourself shall further inquiries be made shall two members of the house_of_peers be sent to ali_pasha_of_yanina speak viscount_albert_de_morcerf did not reply then all the members looked at each other with terror they knew the countâ energetic and violent temper it must be indeed a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend himself they expected that his stupefied silence would be followed by a fiery outburst well asked the president what is your decision 40206m â i have no reply to make said the count in a low tone â has the daughter of ali_pasha_of_yanina tepelini spoken the truth said the president is she then the terrible witness to whose charge you dare not plead not guiltyâ have you really committed the crimes of which you are accused the count looked around him with an expression which might have softened tigers but which could not disarm his judges then he raised his eye towards the ceiling but withdrew then immediately as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view that second tribunal called heaven and that other judge named god
then with a hasty movement he tore open his coat which seemed to stifle him and flew from the room like a madman his footstep was heard one moment in the corridor then the rattling of his carriage wheels as he was driven rapidly away gentlemen said the president when silence was restored is the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf convicted of felony treason and conduct unbecoming a member of this house_of_peers â â_yes replied all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous voice haydã_e had remained until the close of the meeting she heard the countâ sentence pronounced without betraying an expression of joy or pity then drawing her veil over her face she bowed majestically to the councillors and left with that dignified step which virgil attributes to his goddesses chapter 87 the challenge then continued m_beauchamp i took advantage of the silence and the darkness to leave the house_of_peers without being seen the usher who had introduced me was waiting for me at the door and he conducted me through the corridors to a private entrance opening into the rue de vaugirard i left with mingled feelings of sorrow and delight excuse me monsieur_albert sorrow on your account and delight with that noble girl thus pursuing paternal vengeance yes monsieur_albert from whatever source the blow may have proceededâ it may be from an enemy but that enemy is only the agent of providence monsieur_albert held his head between his hand he raised his face red with shame and bathed in tears and seizing beauchampâ arm my friend said he my life is ended i cannot calmly say with you providence has struck the blow but i must discover who pursues me with this hatred and when i have found him i shall kill him or he will kill me
i rely on your friendship to assist me m_beauchamp if contempt has not banished it from your heart â contempt my friend how does this misfortune affect you no happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for the fatherâ actions review your life monsieur_albert although it is only just beginning did a lovely summerâ day ever dawn with greater purity than has marked the commencement of your career no monsieur_albert take my advice you are young and richâ leave parisâ all is soon forgotten in this great babylon of excitement and changing tastes you will return after three or four year with a russian princess for a bride and no one will think more of what occurred yesterday than if it had happened sixteen year ago â thank you my dear m_beauchamp thank you for the excellent feeling which prompts your advice but it cannot be i have told you my wish or rather my determination you understand that interested as i am in this affair i cannot see it in the same light as you do what appears to you to emanate from a celestial source seems to me to proceed from one far less pure providence appears to me to have no share in this affair and happily so for instead of the invisible impalpable agent of celestial rewards and punishments i shall find one both palpable and visible on whom i shall revenge myself i assure you for all i have suffered during the last month now i repeat m_beauchamp i wish to return to human and material existence and if you are still the friend you profess to be help me to discover the hand that struck the blow â be it so said m_beauchamp if
you must have me descend to earth i submit and if you will seek your enemy i will assist you and i will engage to find him my honor being almost as deeply interested as yours â well then you understand m_beauchamp that we begin our search immediately each momentâ delay is an eternity for me the calumniator is not yet punished and he may hope that he will not be but on my honor if he thinks so he deceives himself â well listen viscount_albert_de_morcerf â ah m_beauchamp i see you know something already you will restore me to life â i do not say there is any truth in what i am going to tell you but it is at least a ray of light in a dark night by following it we may perhaps discover something more certain â tell me satisfy my impatience â well i will tell you what i did not like to mention on my return from ali_pasha_of_yanina â say on â i went of course to the chief banker of the town to make inquiries at the first word before i had even mentioned your fatherâ nameâ â ah said he i guess what brings you here â how and why â because a fortnight since i was questioned on the same subject â by whom â by a banker of paris my correspondent â whose name isâ â â mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â he cried monsieur_albert â_yes it is indeed he who has so long pursued my father with jealous hatred
he the man who would be popular cannot forgive the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf for being created a peer and this marriage broken off without a reason being assignedâ yes it is all from the same cause â make inquiries monsieur_albert but do not be angry without reason make inquiries and if it be trueâ â â_oh yes if it be true cried the young man he shall pay me all i have suffered â beware viscount_albert_de_morcerf he is already an old man â i will respect his age as he has respected the honor of my family if my father had offended him why did he not attack him personally oh no he was afraid to encounter him face to face â i do not condemn you monsieur_albert i only restrain you act prudently â_oh do not fear besides you will accompany me m_beauchamp solemn transactions should be sanctioned by a witness before this day closes if mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is guilty he shall cease to live or i shall die pardieu m_beauchamp mine shall be a splendid funeral â when such resolutions are made monsieur_albert they should be promptly executed do you wish to go to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars let us go immediately they sent for a cabriolet on entering the bankerâ mansion they perceived the phaeton and servant of m_andrea_cavalcanti ah parbleu thatâ good said monsieur_albert with a gloomy tone if mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars will not fight with me i will kill his son in law m_andrea_cavalcanti will certainly fight the servant announced the young man but the banker recollecting what had transpired the day before did not wish him admitted it was however too late monsieur_albert had followed the footman and hearing the order given forced the door open and followed by m_beauchamp found himself in the bankerâ study sir cried the latter am
i no longer at liberty to receive whom i choose in my house_of_peers you appear to forget yourself sadly â no sir said monsieur_albert coldly there are circumstances in which one cannot except through cowardice i offer you that refuge refuse to admit certain person at least â what is your errand then with me sir â i mean said monsieur_albert drawing near and without apparently noticing m_andrea_cavalcanti who stood with his back towards the fireplaceâ i mean to propose a meeting in some retired corner where no one will interrupt us for ten minute that will be sufficientâ where two man having met one of them will remain on the ground mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars turned pale m_andrea_cavalcanti moved a step forward and monsieur_albert turned towards him and you too said he come if you like monsieur_albert you have a claim being almost one of the family and i will give as many rendezvous of that kind as i can find person willing to accept them m_andrea_cavalcanti looked at mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with a stupefied air and the latter making an effort arose and stepped between the two young man albertâ attack on m_andrea_cavalcanti had placed him on a different footing and he hoped this visit had another cause than that he had at first supposed indeed sir said he to monsieur_albert if you are come to quarrel with this gentleman because i have preferred him to you i shall resign the case to the kingâ attorney â you mistake sir said viscount_albert_de_morcerf with a gloomy smile i am not referring in the least to matrimony and i only addressed myself to m_andrea_cavalcanti because he appeared disposed to interfere between us
in one respect you are right for i am ready to quarrel with everyone today but you have the first claim mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars 40212m sir replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars pale with anger and fear i warn you when i have the misfortune to meet with a mad dog i kill it and far from thinking myself guilty of a crime i believe i do society a kindness now if you are mad and try to bite me i will kill you without pity is it my fault that your father has dishonored himself â_yes miserable wretch cried viscount_albert_de_morcerf â_it is your fault mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars retreated a few step my fault said he you must be mad what do i know of the grecian affair have i travelled in that country did i advise your father to sell the castle of yaninaâ to betrayâ â silence said monsieur_albert with a thundering voice no it is not you who have directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on us but you hypocritically provoked it â i â_yes you how came it known â i suppose you read it in the paper in the account from ali_pasha_of_yanina â who wrote to ali_pasha_of_yanina â to ali_pasha_of_yanina â_yes who wrote for particulars concerning my father â i imagine anyone may write to ali_pasha_of_yanina â but one person only wrote â one only â_yes and that was you â i doubtless wrote it appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to a young man it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family it is not only a right but a duty â you wrote sir knowing what answer you would receive â i indeed
i assure you cried mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with a confidence and security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt for the young man i solemnly declare to you that i should never have thought of writing to ali_pasha_of_yanina did i know anything of ali_pasha_of_yanina pashaâ misfortunes â who then urged you to write tell me â pardieu it was the most simple thing in the world i was speaking of your fatherâ past history i said the origin of his fortune remained obscure the person to whom i addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property i answered in greece â then said he write to ali_pasha_of_yanina â and who thus advised you â no other than your friend count_of_monte_cristo â the count_of_monte_cristo told you to write to ali_pasha_of_yanina â_yes and i wrote and will show you my correspondence if you like monsieur_albert and m_beauchamp looked at each other sir said m_beauchamp who had not yet spoken you appear to accuse the count who is absent from paris at this moment and cannot justify himself â i accuse no one sir said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i relate and i will repeat before the count what i have said to you â does the count know what answer you received â_yes i showed it to him â did he know my fatherâ christian name was m_fernand_mondego and his family name mondego â_yes i had told him that long since and i did only what any other would have done in my circumstances and perhaps less when the day after the arrival of this answer your father came by the advice of count_of_monte_cristo to ask my daughterâ hand for you i decidedly refused him but without any explanation or exposure
in short why should i have any more to do with the affair how did the honor or disgrace of de viscount_albert_de_morcerf affect me it neither increased nor decreased my income monsieur_albert felt the blood mounting to his brow there was no doubt upon the subject mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars defended himself with the baseness but at the same time with the assurance of a man who speaks the truth at least in part if not whollyâ not for conscienceâ sake but through fear besides what was viscount_albert_de_morcerf seeking it was not whether mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars or count_of_monte_cristo was more or less guilty it was a man who would answer for the offence whether trifling or serious it was a man who would fight and it was evident mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars would not fight in addition to this everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his recollection count_of_monte_cristo knew everything as he had bought the daughter of ali_pasha_of_yanina and knowing everything he had advised mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars to write to ali_pasha_of_yanina the answer known he had yielded to albertâ wish to be introduced to haydã_e and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of ali_pasha_of_yanina and had not opposed haydã eâ recital but having doubtless warned the young girl in the few romaic word he spoke to her not to implicate morcerfâ father besides had he not begged of viscount_albert_de_morcerf not to mention his fatherâ name before haydã_e lastly he had taken monsieur_albert to normandy when he knew the final blow was near there could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged count_of_monte_cristo then was in league with his fatherâ enemies monsieur_albert took m_beauchamp aside and communicated these idea to him
â you are right said the latter m mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars has only been a secondary agent in this sad affair and it is of de count_of_monte_cristo that you must demand an explanation monsieur_albert turned sir said he to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars understand that i do not take a final leave of you i must ascertain if your insinuations are just and am going now to inquire of the count_of_monte_cristo he bowed to the banker and went out with m_beauchamp without appearing to notice m_andrea_cavalcanti mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars accompanied him to the door where he again assured monsieur_albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf chapter 88 the insult at the bankerâ door m_beauchamp stopped viscount_albert_de_morcerf listen said he just now i told you it was of de count_of_monte_cristo you must demand an explanation â_yes and we are going to his house_of_peers â reflect viscount_albert_de_morcerf one moment before you go â on what shall i reflect â on the importance of the step you are taking â is it more serious than going to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â_yes mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is a money lover and those who love money you know think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a duel the other is on the contrary to all appearance a true nobleman but do you not fear to find him a bully â i only fear one thing namely to find a man who will not fight â do not be alarmed said m_beauchamp he will meet you my only fear is that he will be too strong for you â my friend said viscount_albert_de_morcerf with a sweet smile that is what i wish
the happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my fatherâ stead that would save us all â your mother would die of grief â my poor mother said monsieur_albert passing his hand across his eye i know she would but better so than die of shame â are you quite decided monsieur_albert â_yes let us go â but do you think we shall find the count at home â he intended returning some hour after me and doubtless he is now at home they ordered the driver to take them to no 30 champs lysã es m_beauchamp wished to go in alone but monsieur_albert observed that as this was an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual etiquette of duels the cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that m_beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes he yielded and contented himself with following viscount_albert_de_morcerf monsieur_albert sprang from the porterâ lodge to the step he was received by monsieur_baptistin the count had indeed just arrived but he was in his bath and had forbidden that anyone should be admitted but after his bath asked viscount_albert_de_morcerf my master will go to dinner â and after dinner â he will sleep an hour â then â he is going to the opera â are you sure of it asked monsieur_albert quite sir my master has ordered his horse at eight oâ clock precisely â very good replied monsieur_albert that is all i wished to know then turning towards m_beauchamp if you have anything to attend to m_beauchamp do it directly if you have any appointment for this evening defer it till tomorrow
i depend on you to accompany me to the opera and if you can bring baron_de_chã_teau_renaud with you m_beauchamp availed himself of albertâ permission and left him promising to call for him at a quarter before eight on his return home monsieur_albert expressed his wish to m_franz_de_quesnel m_lucien_debray and m_maximilian_morrel to see them at the opera that evening then he went to see his mother who since the events of the day before had refused to see anyone and had kept her room he found her in bed overwhelmed with grief at this public humiliation the sight of monsieur_albert produced the effect which might naturally be expected on mercã_dã_s she pressed her sonâ hand and sobbed aloud but her tears relieved her monsieur_albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his motherâ bed it was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing weaker my dear mother said he do you know if de viscount_albert_de_morcerf has any enemy mercã_dã_s started she noticed that the young man did not say my father â my son she said person in the countâ situation have many secret enemies those who are known are not the most dangerous â i know it and appeal to your penetration you are of so superior a mind nothing escapes you â why do you say so â because for instance you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave that de count_of_monte_cristo would eat nothing in our house_of_peers mercã_dã_s raised herself on her feverish arm m de count_of_monte_cristo she exclaimed and how is he connected with the question you asked me 40219m
â you know mother de count_of_monte_cristo is almost an oriental and it is customary with the orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the house of their enemies â do you say de count_of_monte_cristo is our enemy replied mercã_dã_s becoming paler than the sheet which covered her who told you so why you are mad monsieur_albert de count_of_monte_cristo has only shown us kindness de count_of_monte_cristo saved your life you yourself presented him to us oh i entreat you my son if you had entertained such an idea dispel it and my counsel to youâ nay my prayerâ is to retain his friendship â mother replied the young man you have special reasons for telling me to conciliate that man â i said mercã_dã_s blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale and again becoming paler than ever â_yes doubtless and is it not that he may never do us any harm mercã_dã_s shuddered and fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze you speak strangely said she to monsieur_albert and you appear to have some singular prejudices what has the count done three day since you were with him in normandy only three day since we looked on him as our best friend an ironical smile passed over albertâ lip mercã_dã_s saw it and with the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all but as she was prudent and strong minded she concealed both her sorrows and her fears monsieur_albert was silent an instant after the countess resumed you came to inquire after my health i will candidly acknowledge that i am not well you should install yourself here and cheer my solitude
i do not wish to be left alone â mother said the young man you know how gladly i would obey your wish but an urgent and important affair obliges me to leave you for the whole evening â well replied mercã_dã_s sighing go monsieur_albert i will not make you a slave to your filial piety monsieur_albert pretended he did not hear bowed to his mother and quitted her scarcely had he shut her door when mercã_dã_s called a confidential servant and ordered him to follow monsieur_albert wherever he should go that evening and to come and tell her immediately what he observed then she rang for her ladyâ maid and weak as she was she dressed in order to be ready for whatever might happen the footmanâ mission was an easy one monsieur_albert went to his room and dressed with unusual care at ten minute to eight m_beauchamp arrived he had seen baron_de_chã_teau_renaud who had promised to be in the orchestra before the curtain was raised both got into albertâ coupã and as the young man had no reason to conceal where he was going he called aloud to the opera in his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the performance 40221m baron_de_chã_teau_renaud was at his post apprised by m_beauchamp of the circumstances he required no explanation from monsieur_albert the conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that baron_de_chã_teau_renaud did not seek to dissuade him and was content with renewing his assurances of devotion m_lucien_debray was not yet come but monsieur_albert knew that he seldom lost a scene at the opera monsieur_albert wandered about the theatre until the curtain was drawn up he hoped to meet with de count_of_monte_cristo either in the lobby or on the stairs
the bell summoned him to his seat and he entered the orchestra with baron_de_chã_teau_renaud and m_beauchamp but his eye scarcely quitted the box between the columns which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act at last as monsieur_albert was looking at his watch for about the hundredth time at the beginning of the second act the door opened and count_of_monte_cristo entered dressed in black and leaning over the front of the box looked around the pit m_maximilian_morrel followed him and looked also for his sister and brother in law he soon discovered them in another box and kissed his hand to them the count in his survey of the pit encountered a pale face and threatening eye which evidently sought to gain his attention he recognized monsieur_albert but thought it better not to notice him as he looked so angry and discomposed without communicating his thoughts to his companion he sat down drew out his opera glass and looked another way although apparently not noticing monsieur_albert he did not however lose sight of him and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act he saw him leave the orchestra with his two friend then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on him he was at the moment conversing cheerfully with m_maximilian_morrel but he was well prepared for what might happen the door opened and count_of_monte_cristo turning round saw monsieur_albert pale and trembling followed by m_beauchamp and baron_de_chã_teau_renaud well cried he with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his salutation from the common civilities of the world my cavalier has attained his object
good evening de viscount_albert_de_morcerf the countenance of this man who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings expressed the most perfect cordiality m_maximilian_morrel only then recollected the letter he had received from the viscount in which without assigning any reason he begged him to go to the opera but he understood that something terrible was brooding we are not come here sir to exchange hypocritical expression of politeness or false professions of friendship said monsieur_albert but to demand an explanation the young manâ trembling voice was scarcely audible an explanation at the opera said the count with that calm tone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause is good little acquainted as i am with the habits of parisians i should not have thought this the place for such a demand â still if people will shut themselves up said monsieur_albert and cannot be seen because they are bathing dining or asleep we must avail ourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be seen â i am not difficult of access sir for yesterday if my memory does not deceive me you were at my house_of_peers â yesterday i was at your house_of_peers sir said the young man because then i knew not who you were in pronouncing these word monsieur_albert had raised his voice so as to be heard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the lobby thus the attention of many was attracted by this altercation where are you come from sir said count_of_monte_cristo you do not appear to be in the possession of your senses â provided i understand your perfidy sir and succeed in making you understand that i will be revenged i shall be reasonable enough said monsieur_albert furiously i do not understand you sir replied count_of_monte_cristo
â and if i did your tone is too high i am at home here and i alone have a right to raise my voice above anotherâ leave the box sir count_of_monte_cristo pointed towards the door with the most commanding dignity ah i shall know how to make you leave your home replied monsieur_albert clasping in his convulsed grasp the glove which count_of_monte_cristo did not lose sight of well well said count_of_monte_cristo quietly i see you wish to quarrel with me but i would give you one piece of advice which you will do well to keep in mind it is in poor taste to make a display of a challenge display is not becoming to everyone de viscount_albert_de_morcerf at this name a murmur of astonishment passed around the group of spectators of this scene they had talked of no one but viscount_albert_de_morcerf the whole day monsieur_albert understood the allusion in a moment and was about to throw his glove at the count when m_maximilian_morrel seized his hand while m_beauchamp and baron_de_chã_teau_renaud fearing the scene would surpass the limits of a challenge held him back but count_of_monte_cristo without rising and leaning forward in his chair merely stretched out his arm and taking the damp crushed glove from the clenched hand of the young man sir said he in a solemn tone i consider your glove thrown and will return it to you wrapped around a bullet now leave me or i will summon my servant to throw you out at the door wild almost unconscious and with eye inflamed monsieur_albert stepped back and m_maximilian_morrel closed the door count_of_monte_cristo took up his glass again as if nothing had happened his face was like marble and his heart was like bronze
morrel whispered what have you done to him â i nothingâ at least personally said count_of_monte_cristo but there must be some cause for this strange scene â the count of morcerfâ adventure exasperates the young man â have you anything to do with it â_it was through haydã_e that the chamber was informed of his fatherâ treason â indeed said m_maximilian_morrel i had been told but would not credit it that the grecian slave i have seen with you here in this very box was the daughter of ali_pasha_of_yanina â_it is true nevertheless â then said m_maximilian_morrel i understand it all and this scene was premeditated â how so â_yes monsieur_albert wrote to request me to come to the opera doubtless that i might be a witness to the insult he meant to offer you â probably said count_of_monte_cristo with his imperturbable tranquillity but what shall you do with him â with whom â with monsieur_albert â what shall i do with monsieur_albert as certainly m_maximilian_morrel as i now press your hand i shall kill him before ten oâ clock tomorrow morning m_maximilian_morrel in his turn took monte cristoâ hand in both of his and he shuddered to feel how cold and steady it was ah count said he his father loves him so much â do not speak to me of that said count_of_monte_cristo with the first movement of anger he had betrayed i will make him suffer m_maximilian_morrel amazed let fall monte cristoâ hand count count said he dear m_maximilian_morrel interrupted the count listen how adorably duprez is singing that line â mathilde idole de mon me â i was the first to discover duprez at naples and the first to applaud him bravo bravo m_maximilian_morrel saw it was useless to say more and refrained
the curtain which had risen at the close of the scene with monsieur_albert again fell and a rap was heard at the door come in said count_of_monte_cristo with a voice that betrayed not the least emotion and immediately m_beauchamp appeared good evening m_beauchamp said count_of_monte_cristo as if this was the first time he had seen the journalist that evening be seated m_beauchamp bowed and sitting down sir said he i just now accompanied de viscount_albert_de_morcerf as you saw â and that means replied count_of_monte_cristo laughing that you had probably just dined together i am happy to see m_beauchamp that you are more sober than he was â sir said m_beauchamp monsieur_albert was wrong i acknowledge to betray so much anger and i come on my own account to apologize for him and having done so entirely on my own account be it understood i would add that i believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with ali_pasha_of_yanina then i will add two word about the young greek girl count_of_monte_cristo motioned him to be silent come said he laughing there are all my hopes about to be destroyed â how so asked m_beauchamp doubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric character i am in your opinion a lara a manfred a lord_ruthven then just as i am arriving at the climax you defeat your own end and seek to make an ordinary man of me you bring me down to your own level and demand explanations indeed m_beauchamp it is quite laughable â yet replied m_beauchamp haughtily there are occasions when probity commandsâ â m_beauchamp interposed this strange man the count_of_monte_cristo bows to none but the count_of_monte_cristo himself
say no more i entreat you i do what i please m_beauchamp and it is always well done â sir replied the young man honest man are not to be paid with such coin i require honorable guaranties â i am sir a living guaranty replied count_of_monte_cristo motionless but with a threatening look we have both blood in our veins which we wish to shedâ that is our mutual guaranty tell the viscount so and that tomorrow before ten oâ clock i shall see what color his is â then i have only to make arrangements for the duel said m_beauchamp â_it is quite immaterial to me said count_of_monte_cristo and it was very unnecessary to disturb me at the opera for such a trifle in france people fight with the sword or pistol in the colonies with the carbine in arabia with the dagger tell your client that although i am the insulted party in order to carry out my eccentricity i leave him the choice of arm and will accept without discussion without dispute anything even combat by drawing lots which is always stupid but with me different from other people as i am sure to gain â sure to gain repeated m_beauchamp looking with amazement at the count certainly said count_of_monte_cristo slightly shrugging his shoulders otherwise i would not fight with de viscount_albert_de_morcerf i shall kill himâ i cannot help it only by a single line this evening at my house_of_peers let me know the arm and the hour i do not like to be kept waiting â pistols then at eight oâ clock in the bois de vincennes said m_beauchamp quite disconcerted not knowing if he was dealing with an arrogant braggadocio or a supernatural being very well sir said count_of_monte_cristo
â now all that is settled do let me see the performance and tell your friend monsieur_albert not to come any more this evening he will hurt himself with all his ill chosen barbarisms let him go home and go to sleep m_beauchamp left the box perfectly amazed now said count_of_monte_cristo turning towards m_maximilian_morrel i may depend upon you may i not â certainly said m_maximilian_morrel i am at your service count stillâ â what â_it is desirable i should know the real cause â that is to say you would rather not â no â the young man himself is acting blindfolded and knows not the true cause which is known only to god and to me but i give you my word m_maximilian_morrel that god who does know it will be on our side â enough said m_maximilian_morrel who is your second witness â i know no one in paris m_maximilian_morrel on whom i could confer that honor besides you and your brother m_emmanuel do you think m_emmanuel would oblige me â i will answer for him count â well that is all i require tomorrow morning at seven oâ clock you will be with me will you not â we will â hush the curtain is rising listen i never lose a note of this opera if i can avoid it the music of william tell is so sweet chapter 89 the night count_of_monte_cristo waited according to his usual custom until duprez had sung his famous suivez moi then he rose and went out m_maximilian_morrel took leave of him at the door renewing his promise to be with him the next morning at seven oâ clock and to bring m_emmanuel then he stepped into his coupã calm and smiling and was at home in five minute
no one who knew the count could mistake his expression when on entering he said ali_pasha_of_yanina bring me my pistols with the ivory cross ali_pasha_of_yanina brought the box to his master who examined the weapons with a solicitude very natural to a man who is about to intrust his life to a little powder and shot these were pistols of an especial pattern which count_of_monte_cristo had had made for target practice in his own room a cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was as sportsmen would say keeping his hand in he was just taking one up and looking for the point to aim at on a little iron plate which served him as a target when his study door opened and monsieur_baptistin entered before he had spoken a word the count saw in the next room a veiled woman who had followed closely after monsieur_baptistin and now seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and swords on the table rushed in monsieur_baptistin looked at his master who made a sign to him and he went out closing the door after him who are you madame said the count to the veiled woman 40227 the stranger cast one look around her to be certain that they were quite alone then bending as if she would have knelt and joining her hand she said with an accent of despair edmond_dantã_s you will not kill my son the count retreated a step uttered a slight exclamation and let fall the pistol he held what name did you pronounce then madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf said he yours cried she throwing back her veil â yours which i alone perhaps have not forgotten
edmond it is not madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf who is come to you it is mercã_dã_s â mercã_dã_s is dead madame said count_of_monte_cristo i know no one now of that name â mercã_dã_s life sir and she remembers for she alone recognized you when she saw you and even before she saw you by your voice edmond_dantã_s by the simple sound of your voice and from that moment she has followed your step watched you feared you and she needs not to inquire what hand has dealt the blow which now strikes de viscount_albert_de_morcerf â m_fernand_mondego do you mean replied count_of_monte_cristo with bitter irony since we are recalling name let us remember them all count_of_monte_cristo had pronounced the name of m_fernand_mondego with such an expression of hatred that mercã_dã_s felt a thrill of horror run through every vein you see edmond_dantã_s i am not mistaken and have cause to say spare my son â and who told you madame that i have any hostile intentions against your son â no one in truth but a mother has twofold sight i guessed all i followed him this evening to the opera and concealed in a parquet box have seen all â if you have seen all madame you know that the son of m_fernand_mondego has publicly insulted me said count_of_monte_cristo with awful calmness â_oh for pityâ sake â you have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if m_maximilian_morrel one of my friend had not stopped him â listen to me my son has also guessed who you are he attributes his fatherâ misfortunes to you â madame you are mistaken they are not misfortunes â_it is a punishment it is not i who strike de viscount_albert_de_morcerf it is providence which punishes him â and why do you represent providence cried mercã_dã_s
â why do you remember when it forgets what are ali_pasha_of_yanina and its vizier to you edmond_dantã_s what injury has m_fernand_mondego done you in betraying ali_pasha_of_yanina tepelini â ah madame replied count_of_monte_cristo all this is an affair between the french captain and the daughter of vasiliki it does not concern me you are right and if i have sworn to revenge myself it is not on the french captain or the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf but on the fisherman m_fernand_mondego the husband of mercã_dã_s the catalane â ah sir cried the countess how terrible a vengeance for a fault which fatality made me commit for i am the only culprit edmond_dantã_s and if you owe revenge to anyone it is to me who had not fortitude to bear your absence and my solitude â but exclaimed count_of_monte_cristo why was i absent and why were you alone 40231m because you had been arrested edmond_dantã_s and were a prisoner â and why was i arrested why was i a prisoner â i do not know said mercã_dã_s you do not madame at least i hope not but i will tell you i was arrested and became a prisoner because under the arbor of la rã serve the day before i was to marry you a man named mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars wrote this letter which the fisherman m_fernand_mondego himself posted count_of_monte_cristo went to a secretaire opened a drawer by a spring from which he took a paper which had lost its original color and the ink of which had become of a rusty hueâ this he placed in the hand of mercã_dã_s
it was danglarsâ letter to the kingâ attorney which the count_of_monte_cristo disguised as a clerk from the house_of_peers of thomson_french_of_rome had taken from the file against edmond_dantã_s on the day he had paid the two hundred thousand franc to m_de_boville mercã_dã_s read with terror the following lines the kingâ attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one edmond_dantã_s second in command on board the pharaon this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo is the bearer of a letter from murat to the usurper and of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above mentioned edmond_dantã_s who either carries the letter for paris about with him or has it at his fatherâ abode should it not be found in possession of either father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said edmond_dantã_s on board the pharaon â how dreadful said mercã_dã_s passing her hand across her brow moist with perspiration and that letterâ â i bought it for two hundred thousand franc madame said count_of_monte_cristo but that is a trifle since it enables me to justify myself to you â and the result of that letterâ â you well know madame was my arrest but you do not know how long that arrest lasted you do not know that i remained for fourteen year within a quarter of a league of you in a dungeon in the chã teau dâ if
you do not know that every day of those fourteen year i renewed the vow of vengeance which i had made the first day and yet i was not aware that you had married m_fernand_mondego my calumniator and that my father had died of hunger â can it be cried mercã_dã_s shuddering that is what i heard on leaving my prison fourteen year after i had entered it and that is why on account of the living mercã_dã_s and my deceased father i have sworn to revenge myself on m_fernand_mondego andâ i have revenged myself â and you are sure the unhappy m_fernand_mondego did that â i am satisfied madame that he did what i have told you besides that is not much more odious than that a frenchman by adoption should pass over to the english that a spaniard by birth should have fought against the spaniards that a stipendiary of ali_pasha_of_yanina should have betrayed and murdered ali_pasha_of_yanina compared with such thing what is the letter you have just read a loverâ deception which the woman who has married that man ought certainly to forgive but not so the lover who was to have married her well the french did not avenge themselves on the traitor the spaniards did not shoot the traitor ali_pasha_of_yanina in his tomb left the traitor unpunished but i betrayed sacrificed buried have risen from my tomb by the grace of god to punish that man he sends me for that purpose and here i am the poor womanâ head and arm fell her legs bent under her and she fell on her knees forgive edmond_dantã_s forgive for my sake who love you still the dignity of the wife checked the fervor of the lover and the mother
her forehead almost touched the carpet when the count sprang forward and raised her then seated on a chair she looked at the manly countenance of count_of_monte_cristo on which grief and hatred still impressed a threatening expression not crush that accursed race murmured he abandon my purpose at the moment of its accomplishment impossible madame impossible â edmond_dantã_s said the poor mother who tried every means when i call you edmond_dantã_s why do you not call me mercã_dã_s â mercã_dã_s repeated count_of_monte_cristo mercã_dã_s well yes you are right that name has still its charms and this is the first time for a long period that i have pronounced it so distinctly oh mercã_dã_s i have uttered your name with the sigh of melancholy with the groan of sorrow with the last effort of despair i have uttered it when frozen with cold crouched on the straw in my dungeon i have uttered it consumed with heat rolling on the stone floor of my prison mercã_dã_s i must revenge myself for i suffered fourteen year fourteen year i wept i cursed now i tell you mercã_dã_s i must revenge myself the count fearing to yield to the entreaties of her he had so ardently loved called his sufferings to the assistance of his hatred revenge yourself then edmond_dantã_s cried the poor mother but let your vengeance fall on the culprits on him on me but not on my son â_it is written in the good book said count_of_monte_cristo that the sins of the father shall fall upon their child to the third and fourth generation since god himself dictated those word to his prophet why should i seek to make myself better than god â edmond_dantã_s continued mercã_dã_s with her arm extended towards the count since i first knew you
i have adored your name have respected your memory edmond_dantã_s my friend do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart edmond_dantã_s if you knew all the prayers i have addressed to god for you while i thought you were living and since i have thought you must be dead yes dead alas i imagined your dead body buried at the foot of some gloomy tower or cast to the bottom of a pit by hateful jailers and i wept what could i do for you edmond_dantã_s besides pray and weep listen for ten year i dreamed each night the same dream i had been told that you had endeavored to escape that you had taken the place of another prisoner that you had slipped into the winding sheet of a dead body that you had been thrown alive from the top of the chã teau dâ if and that the cry you uttered as you dashed upon the rocks first revealed to your jailers that they were your murderers well edmond_dantã_s i swear to you by the head of that son for whom i entreat your pity edmond_dantã_s for ten year i saw every night every detail of that frightful tragedy and for ten year i heard every night the cry which awoke me shuddering and cold and i too edmondâ oh believe meâ guilty as i wasâ oh yes i too have suffered much â have you known what it is to have your father starve to death in your absence cried count_of_monte_cristo thrusting his hand into his hair have you seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your rival while you were perishing at the bottom of a dungeon â no interrupted mercã_dã_s but
i have seen him whom i loved on the point of murdering my son mercã_dã_s uttered these word with such deep anguish with an accent of such intense despair that count_of_monte_cristo could not restrain a sob the lion was daunted the avenger was conquered what do you ask of me said he â your sonâ life well he shall live mercã_dã_s uttered a cry which made the tears start from monte cristoâ eye but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously for doubtless god had sent some angel to collect themâ far more precious were they in his eye than the richest pearls of guzerat and ophir â_oh said she seizing the countâ hand and raising it to her lip â_oh thank you thank you edmond_dantã_s now you are exactly what i dreamt you were the man i always loved oh now i may say so â so much the better replied count_of_monte_cristo as that poor edmond_dantã_s will not have long to be loved by you death is about to return to the tomb the phantom to retire in darkness â what do you say edmond_dantã_s â i say since you command me mercã_dã_s i must die â die and why so who talks of dying whence have you these idea of death â you do not suppose that publicly outraged in the face of a whole theatre in the presence of your friend and those of your sonâ challenged by a boy who will glory in my forgiveness as if it were a victoryâ you do not suppose that i can for one moment wish to live what i most loved after you mercã_dã_s was myself my dignity and that strength which rendered me superior to other man that strength was my life with one word you have crushed it and i die â but
the duel will not take place edmond_dantã_s since you forgive â_it will take place said count_of_monte_cristo in a most solemn tone but instead of your sonâ blood to stain the ground mine will flow mercã_dã_s shrieked and sprang towards count_of_monte_cristo but suddenly stopping edmond_dantã_s said she there is a god above us since you live and since i have seen you again i trust to him from my heart while waiting his assistance i trust to your word you have said that my son should live have you not â_yes madame he shall live said count_of_monte_cristo surprised that without more emotion mercã_dã_s had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for her mercã_dã_s extended her hand to the count edmond_dantã_s said she and her eye were wet with tears while looking at him to whom she spoke how noble it is of you how great the action you have just performed how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who appealed to you with every chance against her alas i am grown old with grief more than with year and cannot now remind my edmond_dantã_s by a smile or by a look of that mercã_dã_s whom he once spent so many hour in contemplating ah believe me edmond_dantã_s as i told you i too have suffered much i repeat it is melancholy to pass oneâ life without having one joy to recall without preserving a single hope but that proves that all is not yet over no it is not finished i feel it by what remains in my heart oh i repeat it edmond_dantã_s what you have just done is beautifulâ it is grand it is sublime â do you say so now mercã_dã_s then
what would you say if you knew the extent of the sacrifice i make to you suppose that the supreme being after having created the world and fertilized chaos had paused in the work to spare an angel the tears that might one day flow for mortal sins from her immortal eye suppose that when everything was in readiness and the moment had come for god to look upon his work and see that it was goodâ suppose he had snuffed out the sun and tossed the world back into eternal nightâ thenâ even then mercã_dã_s you could not imagine what i lose in sacrificing my life at this moment mercã_dã_s looked at the count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment her admiration and her gratitude count_of_monte_cristo pressed his forehead on his burning hand as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight of its thoughts edmond_dantã_s said mercã_dã_s i have but one word more to say to you the count smiled bitterly edmond_dantã_s continued she you will see that if my face is pale if my eye are dull if my beauty is gone if mercã_dã_s in short no longer resembles her former self in her features you will see that her heart is still the same adieu then edmond_dantã_s i have nothing more to ask of heavenâ i have seen you again and have found you as noble and as great as formerly you were adieu edmond_dantã_s adieu and thank you but the count did not answer mercã_dã_s opened the door of the study and had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound reverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged him
the clock of the invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf rolled away on the pavement of the champs lysã es and made count_of_monte_cristo raise his head what a fool i was said he not to tear my heart out on the day when i resolved to avenge myself chapter 90 the meeting after mercã_dã_s had left count_of_monte_cristo he fell into profound gloom around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped his energetic mind slumbered as the body does after extreme fatigue what said he to himself while the lamp and the wax light were nearly burnt out and the servant were waiting impatiently in the anteroom what this edifice which i have been so long preparing which i have reared with so much care and toil is to be crushed by a single touch a word a breath yes this self of whom i thought so much of whom i was so proud who had appeared so worthless in the dungeons of the chã teau dâ if and whom i had succeeded in making so great will be but a lump of clay tomorrow alas it is not the death of the body i regret for is not the destruction of the vital principle the repose to which everything is tending to which every unhappy being aspires is not this the repose of matter after which i so long sighed and which i was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when abbã_faria appeared in my dungeon what is death for me one step farther into rest two perhaps into silence no it is not existence then that i regret but the ruin of projects so slowly carried out so laboriously framed
providence is now opposed to them when i most thought it would be propitious it is not godâ will that they should be accomplished this burden almost as heavy as a world which i had raised and i had thought to bear to the end was too great for my strength and i was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career oh shall i then again become a fatalist whom fourteen year of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in providence and all thisâ all this because my heart which i thought dead was only sleeping because it has awakened and has begun to beat again because i have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a womanâ voice yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which mercã_dã_s had accepted yet it is impossible that so noble minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love or rather delirium there are virtues which become crimes by exaggeration no she must have conceived some pathetic scene she will come and throw herself between us and what would be sublime here will there appear ridiculous the blush of pride mounted to the countâ forehead as this thought passed through his mind ridiculous repeated he and the ridicule will fall on me i ridiculous
no i would rather die by thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated ill fortune of the next day to which he had condemned himself by promising mercã_dã_s to spare her son the count at last exclaimed folly folly folly to carry generosity so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young man to aim at he will never believe that my death was suicide and yet it is important for the honor of my memory and this surely is not vanity but a justifiable pride â_it is important the world should know that i have consented by my free will to stop my arm already raised to strike and that with the arm which has been so powerful against others i have struck myself it must be it shall be seizing a pen he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk and wrote at the bottom of the document which was no other than his will made since his arrival in paris a sort of codicil clearly explaining the nature of his death i do this oh my god said he with his eye raised to heaven as much for thy honor as for mine i have during ten year considered myself the agent of thy vengeance and other wretches like viscount_albert_de_morcerf mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort even viscount_albert_de_morcerf himself must not imagine that chance has freed them from their enemy
let them know on the contrary that their punishment which had been decreed by providence is only delayed by my present determination and although they escape it in this world it awaits them in another and that they are only exchanging time for eternity while he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertainties wretched waking dreams of grief the first rays of morning pierced his window and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of providence it was just five oâ clock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear he turned his head looked around him and saw no one but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its reality he arose and quietly opening the door of the drawing room saw haydã_e who had fallen on a chair with her arm hanging down and her beautiful head thrown back she had been standing at the door to prevent his going out without seeing her until sleep which the young cannot resist had overpowered her frame wearied as she was with watching the noise of the door did not awaken her and count_of_monte_cristo gazed at her with affectionate regret she remembered that she had a son said he and i forgot i had a daughter then shaking his head sorrowfully poor haydã_e said he she wished to see me to speak to me she has feared or guessed something oh i cannot go without taking leave of her i cannot die without confiding her to someone he quietly regained his seat and wrote under the other lines i bequeath to m_maximilian_morrel captain of spahis and son of my former patron pierre m_maximilian_morrel shipowner at marseilles the sum of twenty millions
a part of which may be offered to his sister mademoiselle_julie and brother in law m_emmanuel if he does not fear this increase of fortune may mar their happiness these twenty millions are concealed in my grotto at count_of_monte_cristo of which monsieur_bertuccio knows the secret if his heart is free and he will marry haydã_e the daughter of ali_pasha_of_yanina whom i have brought up with the love of a father and who has shown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me he will thus accomplish my last wish this will has already constituted haydã_e heiress of the rest of my fortune consisting of lands funds in england austria and holland furniture in my different palaces and house and which without the twenty millions and the legacies to my servant may still amount to sixty millions 40241m he was finishing the last line when a cry behind him made him start and the pen fell from his hand haydã_e said he did you read it â_oh my lord said she why are you writing thus at such an hour why are you bequeathing all your fortune to me are you going to leave me â i am going on a journey dear child said count_of_monte_cristo with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy and if any misfortune should happen to meâ â the count stopped well asked the young girl with an authoritative tone the count had never observed before and which startled him well if any misfortune happen to me replied count_of_monte_cristo i wish my daughter to be happy haydã_e smiled sorrowfully and shook her head do you think of dying my lord said she
â the wise man my child has said â_it is good to think of death â well if you die said she bequeath your fortune to others for if you die i shall require nothing and taking the paper she tore it in four pieces and threw it into the middle of the room then the effort having exhausted her strength she fell not asleep this time but fainting on the floor the count leaned over her and raised her in his arm and seeing that sweet pale face those lovely eye closed that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless the idea occurred to him for the first time that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father alas murmured he with intense suffering i might then have been happy yet then he carried haydã_e to her room resigned her to the care of her attendants and returning to his study which he shut quickly this time he again copied the destroyed will as he was finishing the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard count_of_monte_cristo approached the window and saw m_maximilian_morrel and m_emmanuel alight good said he â_it was time â and he sealed his will with three seals a moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing room and went to open the door himself m_maximilian_morrel was there he had come twenty minute before the time appointed i am perhaps come too soon count said he but i frankly acknowledge that i have not closed my eye all night nor has anyone in my house_of_peers
i need to see you strong in your courageous assurance to recover myself count_of_monte_cristo could not resist this proof of affection he not only extended his hand to the young man but flew to him with open arm m_maximilian_morrel said he â_it is a happy day for me to feel that i am beloved by such a man as you good morning m_emmanuel you will come with me then m_maximilian_morrel â did you doubt it said the young captain but if i were wrongâ â i watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday i have been thinking of your firmness all night and i said to myself that justice must be on your side or manâ countenance is no longer to be relied on â but m_maximilian_morrel monsieur_albert is your friend â simply an acquaintance sir â you met on the same day you first saw me â_yes that is true but i should not have recollected it if you had not reminded me â thank you m_maximilian_morrel then ringing the bell once look said he to ali_pasha_of_yanina who came immediately take that to my solicitor it is my will m_maximilian_morrel when i am dead you will go and examine it â what said m_maximilian_morrel you dead â_yes must i not be prepared for everything dear friend but what did you do yesterday after you left me â i went to tortoniâ where as i expected i found m_beauchamp and baron_de_chã_teau_renaud i own i was seeking them â why when all was arranged â listen count the affair is serious and unavoidable â did
you doubt it â no the offence was public and everyone is already talking of it â well â well i hoped to get an exchange of arm to substitute the sword for the pistol the pistol is blind â have you succeeded asked count_of_monte_cristo quickly with an imperceptible gleam of hope no for your skill with the sword is so well known â ah who has betrayed me â the skilful swordsman whom you have conquered â and you failed â they positively refused â m_maximilian_morrel said the count have you ever seen me fire a pistol â never â well we have time look count_of_monte_cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when mercã_dã_s entered and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron plate with four shots he successively shot off the four side of the club at each shot m_maximilian_morrel turned pale he examined the bullets with which count_of_monte_cristo performed this dexterous feat and saw that they were no larger than buckshot â_it is astonishing said he look m_emmanuel then turning towards count_of_monte_cristo count said he in the name of all that is dear to you i entreat you not to kill monsieur_albert the unhappy youth has a mother â you are right said count_of_monte_cristo and i have none these word were uttered in a tone which made m_maximilian_morrel shudder you are the offended party count â doubtless what does that imply â that you will fire first â i fire first â_oh i obtained or rather claimed that we had conceded enough for them to yield us that â and at what distance â twenty paces a smile of terrible import passed over the countâ lip m_maximilian_morrel said he do not forget what you have just seen â the only chance for albertâ safety then will arise from your emotion â i suffer from emotion said count_of_monte_cristo
â or from your generosity my friend to so good a marksman as you are i may say what would appear absurd to another â what is that â break his armâ wound himâ but do not kill him â i will tell you m_maximilian_morrel said the count that i do not need entreating to spare the life of de viscount_albert_de_morcerf he shall be so well spared that he will return quietly with his two friend while iâ â and you â that will be another thing i shall be brought home â no no cried m_maximilian_morrel quite unable to restrain his feelings as i told you my dear m_maximilian_morrel de viscount_albert_de_morcerf will kill me m_maximilian_morrel looked at him in utter amazement but what has happened then since last evening count â the same thing that happened to brutus the night before the battle of philippi i have seen a ghost â and that ghostâ â told me m_maximilian_morrel that i had lived long enough m_maximilian_morrel and m_emmanuel looked at each other count_of_monte_cristo drew out his watch let us go said he â_it is five minute past seven and the appointment was for eight oâ clock a carriage was in readiness at the door count_of_monte_cristo stepped into it with his two friend he had stopped a moment in the passage to listen at a door and m_maximilian_morrel and m_emmanuel who had considerately passed forward a few step thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a sob from within as the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of meeting we are first said m_maximilian_morrel looking out of the window excuse me sir said monsieur_baptistin who had followed his master with indescribable terror but
i think i see a carriage down there under the trees count_of_monte_cristo sprang lightly from the carriage and offered his hand to assist m_emmanuel and m_maximilian_morrel the latter retained the countâ hand between his i like said he to feel a hand like this when its owner relies on the goodness of his cause â_it seems to me said m_emmanuel that i see two young man down there who are evidently waiting count_of_monte_cristo drew m_maximilian_morrel a step or two behind his brother in law m_maximilian_morrel said he are your affections disengaged m_maximilian_morrel looked at count_of_monte_cristo with astonishment i do not seek your confidence my dear friend i only ask you a simple question answer it that is all i require â i love a young girl count â do you love her much â more than my life â another hope defeated said the count then with a sigh poor haydã_e murmured he to tell the truth count if i knew less of you i should think that you were less brave than you are â because i sigh when thinking of someone i am leaving come m_maximilian_morrel it is not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of courage do i regret life what is it to me who have passed twenty year between life and death moreover do not alarm yourself m_maximilian_morrel this weakness if it is such is betrayed to you alone i know the world is a drawing room from which we must retire politely and honestly that is with a bow and our debts of honor paid â that is to the purpose have you brought your arm â i what for
i hope these gentlemen have theirs â i will inquire said m_maximilian_morrel do but make no treatyâ you understand me â you need not fear m_maximilian_morrel advanced towards m_beauchamp and baron_de_chã_teau_renaud who seeing his intention came to meet him the three young man bowed to each other courteously if not affably excuse me gentlemen said m_maximilian_morrel but i do not see de viscount_albert_de_morcerf â he sent us word this morning replied baron_de_chã_teau_renaud that he would meet us on the ground â ah said m_maximilian_morrel m_beauchamp pulled out his watch â_it is only five minute past eight said he to m_maximilian_morrel there is not much time lost yet â_oh i made no allusion of that kind replied m_maximilian_morrel there is a carriage coming said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud it advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were assembled you are doubtless provided with pistols gentlemen de count_of_monte_cristo yields his right of using his â we had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count said m_beauchamp and i have brought some weapons which i bought eight or ten day since thinking to want them on a similar occasion they are quite new and have not yet been used will you examine them â_oh m_beauchamp if you assure me that de viscount_albert_de_morcerf does not know these pistols you may readily believe that your word will be quite sufficient â gentlemen said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud â_it is not viscount_albert_de_morcerf coming in that carriage faith it is m_franz_de_quesnel and m_lucien_debray the two young man he announced were indeed approaching what chance brings you here gentlemen said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud shaking hand with each of them because said m_lucien_debray monsieur_albert sent this morning to request us to come m_beauchamp and baron_de_chã_teau_renaud exchanged look of astonishment i think i understand his reason said m_maximilian_morrel
â what is it â yesterday afternoon i received a letter from de viscount_albert_de_morcerf begging me to attend the opera â and i said m_lucien_debray and i also said m_franz_de_quesnel and we too added m_beauchamp and baron_de_chã_teau_renaud having wished you all to witness the challenge he now wishes you to be present at the combat â exactly so said the young man you have probably guessed right â but after all these arrangements he does not come himself said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud monsieur_albert is ten minute after time â there he comes said m_beauchamp on horseback at full gallop followed by a servant â how imprudent said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistols after all the instructions i had given him â and besides said m_beauchamp with a collar above his cravat an open coat and white waistcoat why has he not painted a spot upon his heart â_it would have been more simple meanwhile monsieur_albert had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young man he jumped from his horse threw the bridle on his servantâ arm and joined them he was pale and his eye were red and swollen it was evident that he had not slept a shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance which was not natural to him i thank you gentlemen said he for having complied with my request i feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship m_maximilian_morrel had stepped back as viscount_albert_de_morcerf approached and remained at a short distance and to you also m_maximilian_morrel my thanks are due come there cannot be too many 40248m sir said m_maximilian_morrel you are not perhaps aware that i am de monte cristoâ friend â i was not sure but i thought it might be so
so much the better the more honorable man there are here the better i shall be satisfied â m_maximilian_morrel said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud will you apprise the count_of_monte_cristo that de viscount_albert_de_morcerf is arrived and we are at his disposal m_maximilian_morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission m_beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage stop gentlemen said monsieur_albert i have two word to say to the count_of_monte_cristo â in private asked m_maximilian_morrel no sir before all who are here albertâ witnesses looked at each other m_franz_de_quesnel and m_lucien_debray exchanged some word in a whisper and m_maximilian_morrel rejoiced at this unexpected incident went to fetch the count who was walking in a retired path with m_emmanuel what does he want with me said count_of_monte_cristo i do not know but he wishes to speak to you â ah said count_of_monte_cristo i trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult â i do not think that such is his intention said m_maximilian_morrel the count advanced accompanied by m_maximilian_morrel and m_emmanuel his calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to albertâ grief stricken face who approached also followed by the other four young man when at three paces distant from each other monsieur_albert and the count stopped approach gentlemen said monsieur_albert i wish you not to lose one word of what i am about to have the honor of saying to the count_of_monte_cristo for it must be repeated by you to all who will listen to it strange as it may appear to you â proceed sir said the count
â sir said monsieur_albert at first with a tremulous voice but which gradually became firmer i reproached you with exposing the conduct of de viscount_albert_de_morcerf in epirus for guilty as i knew he was i thought you had no right to punish him but i have since learned that you had that right it is not m_fernand_mondego mondegoâ treachery towards ali_pasha_of_yanina which induces me so readily to excuse you but the treachery of the fisherman m_fernand_mondego towards you and the almost unheard of miseries which were its consequences and i say and proclaim it publicly that you were justified in revenging yourself on my father and i his son thank you for not using greater severity had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected scene it would not have surprised them more than did albertâ declaration as for count_of_monte_cristo his eye slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude he could not understand how albertâ fiery nature of which he had seen so much among the roman bandits had suddenly stooped to this humiliation he recognized the influence of mercã_dã_s and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be useless now sir said monsieur_albert if you think my apology sufficient pray give me your hand next to the merit of infallibility which you appear to possess i rank that of candidly acknowledging a fault but this confession concerns me only i acted well as a man but you have acted better than man
an angel alone could have saved one of us from deathâ that angel came from heaven if not to make us friend which alas fatality renders impossible at least to make us esteem each other count_of_monte_cristo with moistened eye heaving breast and lip half open extended to monsieur_albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment resembling respectful fear gentlemen said he m de count_of_monte_cristo receives my apology i had acted hastily towards him hasty actions are generally bad one now my fault is repaired i hope the world will not call me cowardly for acting as my conscience dictated but if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me added he drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friend and enemies i shall endeavor to correct his mistake â what happened during the night asked m_beauchamp of baron_de_chã_teau_renaud we appear to make a very sorry figure here â in truth what monsieur_albert has just done is either very despicable or very noble replied the baron what can it mean said m_lucien_debray to m_franz_de_quesnel the count_of_monte_cristo acts dishonorably to de viscount_albert_de_morcerf and is justified by his son had i ten yaninas in my family i should only consider myself the more bound to fight ten time as for count_of_monte_cristo his head was bent down his arm were powerless bowing under the weight of twenty four yearsâ reminiscences he thought not of monsieur_albert of m_beauchamp of baron_de_chã_teau_renaud or of any of that group but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her sonâ life to whom he had offered his and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret capable of destroying forever in that young manâ heart every feeling of filial piety
â providence still murmured he now only am i fully convinced of being the emissary of god chapter 91 mother and son the count_of_monte_cristo bowed to the five young man with a melancholy and dignified smile and got into his carriage with m_maximilian_morrel and m_emmanuel monsieur_albert m_beauchamp and baron_de_chã_teau_renaud remained alone monsieur_albert looked at his two friend not timidly but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just done indeed my dear friend said m_beauchamp first who had either the most feeling or the least dissimulation allow me to congratulate you this is a very unhoped for conclusion of a very disagreeable affair monsieur_albert remained silent and wrapped in thought baron_de_chã_teau_renaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane are we not going said he after this embarrassing silence when you please replied m_beauchamp allow me only to compliment de viscount_albert_de_morcerf who has given proof today of rare chivalric generosity â_oh yes said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud â_it is magnificent continued m_beauchamp to be able to exercise so much self control â assuredly as for me i should have been incapable of it said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud with most significant coolness gentlemen interrupted monsieur_albert i think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between de count_of_monte_cristo and myself â possibly possibly said m_beauchamp immediately but every simpleton would not be able to understand your heroism and sooner or later you will find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically than would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your life may i give you a friendly counsel set out for naples the hague or st petersburgâ calm countries where the point of honor is better understood than among our hot headed parisians
seek quietude and oblivion so that you may return peaceably to france after a few year am i not right de baron_de_chã_teau_renaud 40252m that is quite my opinion said the gentleman nothing induces serious duels so much as a duel forsworn â thank you gentlemen replied monsieur_albert with a smile of indifference i shall follow your adviceâ not because you give it but because i had before intended to quit france i thank you equally for the service you have rendered me in being my seconds it is deeply engraved on my heart and after what you have just said i remember that only baron_de_chã_teau_renaud and m_beauchamp looked at each other the impression was the same on both of them and the tone in which viscount_albert_de_morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued good bye monsieur_albert said m_beauchamp suddenly carelessly extending his hand to the young man the latter did not appear to arouse from his lethargy in fact he did not notice the offered hand good bye said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud in his turn keeping his little cane in his left hand and saluting with his right albertâ lip scarcely whispered good bye but his look was more explicit it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger proud disdain and generous indignation he preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friend had regained their carriage then suddenly unfastening his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it he mounted and galloped off in the direction of paris in a quarter of an hour he was entering the house_of_peers in the rue du helder as he alighted he thought he saw his fatherâ pale face behind the curtain of the countâ bedroom
albert turned away his head with a sigh and went to his own apartments he cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy he looked at the pictures whose face seemed to smile and the landscapes which appeared painted in brighter colors then he took away his motherâ portrait with its oaken frame leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and empty then he arranged all his beautiful turkish arm his fine english guns his japanese china his cups mounted in silver his artistic bronzes by feuchã res or barye examined the cupboards and placed the key in each threw into a drawer of his secretaire which he left open all the pocket money he had about him and with it the thousand fancy jewels from his vases and his jewel boxes then he made an exact inventory of everything and placed it in the most conspicuous part of the table after putting aside the books and paper which had collected there at the beginning of this work his servant notwithstanding order to the contrary came to his room what do you want asked he with a more sorrowful than angry tone pardon me sir replied the valet you had forbidden me to disturb you but the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf has called me â well said monsieur_albert i did not like to go to him without first seeing you â why â because the count is doubtless aware that i accompanied you to the meeting this morning 40254m â_it is probable said monsieur_albert and since he has sent for me it is doubtless to question me on what happened there what must i answer â the truth
â then i shall say the duel did not take place â you will say i apologized to the count_of_monte_cristo go the valet bowed and retired and monsieur_albert returned to his inventory as he was finishing this work the sound of horse prancing in the yard and the wheels of a carriage shaking his window attracted his attention he approached the window and saw his father get into it and drive away the door was scarcely closed when monsieur_albert bent his step to his motherâ room and no one being there to announce him he advanced to her bedchamber and distressed by what he saw and guessed stopped for one moment at the door as if the same idea had animated these two beings mercã_dã_s was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in his everything was in order laces dresses jewels linen money all were arranged in the drawers and the countess was carefully collecting the keys monsieur_albert saw all these preparations and understood them and exclaiming my mother he threw his arm around her neck the artist who could have depicted the expression of these two countenances would certainly have made of them a beautiful picture all these proofs of an energetic resolution which monsieur_albert did not fear on his own account alarmed him for his mother what are you doing asked he what were you doing replied she â_oh my mother exclaimed albert
so overcome he could scarcely speak â_it is not the same with you and meâ you cannot have made the same resolution i have for i have come to warn you that i bid adieu to your house_of_peers andâ and to you â i also replied mercã_dã_s am going and i acknowledge i had depended on your accompanying me have i deceived myself â mother said monsieur_albert with firmness i cannot make you share the fate i have planned for myself i must live henceforth without rank and fortune and to begin this hard apprenticeship i must borrow from a friend the loaf i shall eat until i have earned one so my dear mother i am going at once to ask m_franz_de_quesnel to lend me the small sum i shall require to supply my present wants â you my poor child suffer poverty and hunger oh do not say so it will break my resolutions â but not mine mother replied monsieur_albert i am young and strong i believe i am courageous and since yesterday i have learned the power of will alas my dear mother some have suffered so much and yet live and have raised a new fortune on the ruin of all the promises of happiness which heaven had made themâ on the fragments of all the hope which god had given them i have seen that mother i know that from the gulf in which their enemies have plunged them they have risen with so much vigor and glory that in their turn they have ruled their former conquerors and have punished them
no mother from this moment i have done with the past and accept nothing from itâ not even a name because you can understand that your son cannot bear the name of a man who ought to blush for it before another â monsieur_albert my child said mercã_dã_s if i had a stronger heart that is the counsel i would have given you your conscience has spoken when my voice became too weak listen to its dictates you had friend monsieur_albert break off their acquaintance but do not despair you have life before you my dear monsieur_albert for you are yet scarcely twenty two year old and as a pure heart like yours wants a spotless name take my fatherâ sâ it was herrera i am sure my dear monsieur_albert whatever may be your career you will soon render that name illustrious then my son return to the world still more brilliant because of your former sorrows and if i am wrong still let me cherish these hopes for i have no future to look forward to for me the grave opens when i pass the threshold of this house_of_peers â i will fulfil all your wishes my dear mother said the young man â_yes i share your hopes the anger of heaven will not pursue us since you are pure and i am innocent but since our resolution is formed let us act promptly de viscount_albert_de_morcerf went out about half an hour ago the opportunity is favorable to avoid an explanation â i am ready my son said mercã_dã_s monsieur_albert ran to fetch a carriage he recollected that there was a small furnished house_of_peers to let in the rue des saints pã res where his mother would find a humble but decent lodging and thither he intended conducting the countess
as the carriage stopped at the door and monsieur_albert was alighting a man approached and gave him a letter monsieur_albert recognized the bearer from the count said monsieur_bertuccio monsieur_albert took the letter opened and read it then looked round for monsieur_bertuccio but he was gone he returned to mercã_dã_s with tears in his eye and heaving breast and without uttering a word he gave her the letter mercã_dã_s read monsieur_albert while showing you that i have discovered your plans i hope also to convince you of my delicacy you are free you leave the countâ house_of_peers and you take your mother to your home but reflect monsieur_albert you owe her more than your poor noble heart can pay her keep the struggle for yourself bear all the suffering but spare her the trial of poverty which must accompany your first efforts for she deserves not even the shadow of the misfortune which has this day fallen on her and providence is not willing that the innocent should suffer for the guilty i know you are going to leave the rue du helder without taking anything with you do not seek to know how i discovered it i know itâ that is sufficient now listen monsieur_albert twenty four year ago i returned proud and joyful to my country i had a betrothed monsieur_albert a lovely girl whom i adored and i was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis_xviii painfully amassed by ceaseless toil this money was for her i destined it for her and knowing the treachery of the sea i buried our treasure in the little garden of the house_of_peers my father lived in at marseilles on the allã es de meilhan your mother monsieur_albert knows that poor house_of_peers well
a short time since i passed through marseilles and went to see the old place which revived so many painful recollections and in the evening i took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where i had concealed my treasure the iron box was thereâ no one had touched itâ under a beautiful fig tree my father had planted the day i was born which overshadowed the spot well monsieur_albert this money which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman i adored may now through strange and painful circumstances be devoted to the same purpose â_oh feel for me who could offer millions to that poor woman but who return her only the piece of black bread forgotten under my poor roof since the day i was torn from her i loved you are a generous man monsieur_albert but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or resentment if you refuse me if you ask another for what i have a right to offer you i will say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life of your mother at the hand of a man whose father was allowed by your father to die in all the horrors of poverty and despair monsieur_albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this letter mercã_dã_s turned her eye with an ineffable look towards heaven i accept it said she he has a right to pay the dowry which i shall take with me to some convent putting the letter in her bosom she took her sonâ arm and with a firmer step than she even herself expected she went downstairs chapter 92 the suicide meanwhile count_of_monte_cristo had also returned to town with m_emmanuel and m_maximilian_morrel
their return was cheerful m_emmanuel did not conceal his joy at the peaceful termination of the affair and was loud in his expression of delight m_maximilian_morrel in a corner of the carriage allowed his brother in lawâ gayety to expend itself in word while he felt equal inward joy which however betrayed itself only in his countenance at the barriã re du trã ne they met monsieur_bertuccio who was waiting there motionless as a sentinel at his post count_of_monte_cristo put his head out of the window exchanged a few word with him in a low tone and the steward disappeared count said m_emmanuel when they were at the end of the place royale put me down at my door that my wife may not have a single moment of needless anxiety on my account or yours â if it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph said m_maximilian_morrel i would invite the count to our house_of_peers besides that he doubtless has some trembling heart to comfort so we will take leave of our friend and let him hasten home â stop a moment said count_of_monte_cristo do not let me lose both my companions return m_emmanuel to your charming wife and present my best compliments to her and do you m_maximilian_morrel accompany me to the champs lysã es â willingly said m_maximilian_morrel particularly as i have business in that quarter â shall we wait breakfast for you asked m_emmanuel no replied the young man the door was closed and the carriage proceeded see what good fortune i brought you said m_maximilian_morrel when he was alone with the count have you not thought so â_yes said count_of_monte_cristo for that reason i wished to keep you near me â_it is miraculous continued m_maximilian_morrel answering his own thoughts what said count_of_monte_cristo
â what has just happened â_yes said the count you are rightâ it is miraculous â for monsieur_albert is brave resumed m_maximilian_morrel very brave said count_of_monte_cristo i have seen him sleep with a sword suspended over his head â and i know he has fought two duels said m_maximilian_morrel how can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning â all owing to your influence replied count_of_monte_cristo smiling â_it is well for monsieur_albert he is not in the army said m_maximilian_morrel why â an apology on the ground said the young captain shaking his head come said the count mildly do not entertain the prejudices of ordinary man m_maximilian_morrel acknowledge that if monsieur_albert is brave he cannot be a coward he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this morning and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise â doubtless doubtless said m_maximilian_morrel but i shall say like the spaniard he has not been so brave today as he was yesterday â you will breakfast with me will you not m_maximilian_morrel said the count to turn the conversation no i must leave you at ten oâ clock â your engagement was for breakfast then said the count m_maximilian_morrel smiled and shook his head still you must breakfast somewhere â but if i am not hungry said the young man â_oh said the count i only know two thing which destroy the appetite griefâ and as i am happy to see you very cheerful it is not thatâ and love now after what you told me this morning of your heart i may believeâ â well count replied m_maximilian_morrel gayly i will not dispute it â but you will not make me your confidant m_maximilian_morrel said the count in a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the secret
â i showed you this morning that i had a heart did i not count count_of_monte_cristo only answered by extending his hand to the young man well continued the latter since that heart is no longer with you in the bois de vincennes it is elsewhere and i must go and find it â go said the count deliberately go dear friend but promise me if you meet with any obstacle to remember that i have some power in this world that i am happy to use that power in the behalf of those i love and that i love you m_maximilian_morrel 40260m i will remember it said the young man as selfish child recollect their parents when they want their aid when i need your assistance and the moment arrives i will come to you count â well i rely upon your promise good bye then â good bye till we meet again they had arrived in the champs lysã es count_of_monte_cristo opened the carriage door m_maximilian_morrel sprang out on the pavement monsieur_bertuccio was waiting on the step m_maximilian_morrel disappeared down the avenue de marigny and count_of_monte_cristo hastened to join monsieur_bertuccio well asked he she is going to leave her house_of_peers said the steward and her son â florentin his valet thinks he is going to do the same â come this way count_of_monte_cristo took monsieur_bertuccio into his study wrote the letter we have seen and gave it to the steward go said he quickly but first let haydã_e be informed that i have returned â here i am said the young girl who at the sound of the carriage had run downstairs and whose face was radiant with joy at seeing the count return safely monsieur_bertuccio left
every transport of a daughter finding a father all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover were felt by haydã_e during the first moment of this meeting which she had so eagerly expected doubtless although less evident monte cristoâ joy was not less intense joy to heart which have suffered long is like the dew on the ground after a long drought both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them and nothing is outwardly apparent count_of_monte_cristo was beginning to think what he had not for a long time dared to believe that there were two mercã_dã_s in the world and he might yet be happy his eye elate with happiness was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of haydã_e when suddenly the door opened the count knit his brow m de viscount_albert_de_morcerf said monsieur_baptistin as if that name sufficed for his excuse in fact the countâ face brightened which asked he the viscount or the count â the count â_oh exclaimed haydã_e is it not yet over â i know not if it is finished my beloved child said count_of_monte_cristo taking the young girlâ hand but i do know you have nothing more to fear â but it is the wretchedâ â that man cannot injure me haydã_e said count_of_monte_cristo â_it was his son alone that there was cause to fear â and what i have suffered said the young girl you shall never know my lord count_of_monte_cristo smiled by my fatherâ tomb said he extending his hand over the head of the young girl i swear to you haydã_e that if any misfortune happens it will not be to me â i believe you my lord as implicitly as if god had spoken to me said the young girl presenting her forehead to him
monte cristo pressed on that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two heart throb at once the one violently the other secretly â_oh murmured the count shall i then be permitted to love again ask de viscount_albert_de_morcerf into the drawing room said he to monsieur_baptistin while he led the beautiful greek girl to a private staircase we must explain this visit which although expected by count_of_monte_cristo is unexpected to our readers while mercã_dã_s as we have said was making a similar inventory of her property to albertâ while she was arranging her jewels shutting her drawers collecting her keys to leave everything in perfect order she did not perceive a pale and sinister face at a glass door which threw light into the passage from which everything could be both seen and heard he who was thus looking without being heard or seen probably heard and saw all that passed in madame de morcerfâ apartments from that glass door the pale faced man went to the countâ bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the curtain of a window overlooking the courtyard he remained there ten minute motionless and dumb listening to the beating of his own heart for him those ten minute were very long it was then monsieur_albert returning from his meeting with the count perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain and turned aside the countâ eye expanded he knew monsieur_albert had insulted the count dreadfully and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly duel monsieur_albert returned safelyâ then the count was revenged
an indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect not of a downy couch but of a tomb but as we have said he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his triumph he easily understood why his son did not come to see him before he went to avenge his fatherâ honor but when that was done why did not his son come and throw himself into his arm it was then when the count could not see monsieur_albert that he sent for his servant who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him ten minute afterwards general viscount_albert_de_morcerf was seen on the step in a black coat with a military collar black pantaloons and black gloves he had apparently given previous order for as he reached the bottom step his carriage came from the coach house_of_peers ready for him the valet threw into the carriage his military cloak in which two swords were wrapped and shutting the door he took his seat by the side of the coachman the coachman stooped down for his order to the champs lysã es said the general the count of monte cristoâ hurry the horse bounded beneath the whip and in five minute they stopped before the countâ door de viscount_albert_de_morcerf opened the door himself and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk rang and entered the open door with his servant a moment afterwards monsieur_baptistin announced the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf to count_of_monte_cristo and the latter leading haydã_e aside ordered that viscount_albert_de_morcerf be asked into the drawing room
the general was pacing the room the third time when in turning he perceived count_of_monte_cristo at the door ah it is de viscount_albert_de_morcerf said count_of_monte_cristo quietly i thought i had not heard aright â_yes it is i said the count whom a frightful contraction of the lip prevented from articulating freely may i know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing de viscount_albert_de_morcerf so early â had you not a meeting with my son this morning asked the general i had replied the count and i know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you and to endeavor to kill you â_yes sir he had very good one but you see that in spite of them he has not killed me and did not even fight â yet he considered you the cause of his fatherâ dishonor the cause of the fearful ruin which has fallen on my house_of_peers â_it is true sir said count_of_monte_cristo with his dreadful calmness a secondary cause but not the principal â doubtless you made then some apology or explanation â i explained nothing and it is he who apologized to me â but to what do you attribute this conduct â to the conviction probably that there was one more guilty than i â and who was that â his father â that may be said the count turning pale but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves convicted â i know it and i expected this result â you expected my son would be a coward cried the count m monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf is no coward said count_of_monte_cristo a man who holds a sword in his hand and sees a mortal enemy within reach of that sword and does not fight is a coward
why is he not here that i may tell him so â sir replied count_of_monte_cristo coldly i did not expect that you had come here to relate to me your little family affairs go and tell monsieur_albert that and he may know what to answer you â_oh no no said the general smiling faintly i did not come for that purpose you are right i came to tell you that i also look upon you as my enemy i came to tell you that i hate you instinctively that it seems as if i had always known you and always hated you and in short since the young people of the present day will not fight it remains for us to do so do you think so sir â certainly and when i told you i had foreseen the result it is the honor of your visit i alluded to â so much the better are you prepared â_yes sir â you know that we shall fight till one of us is dead said the general whose teeth were clenched with rage 40262m until one of us dies repeated count_of_monte_cristo moving his head slightly up and down let us start then we need no witnesses â very true said count_of_monte_cristo â_it is unnecessary we know each other so well â on the contrary said the count we know so little of each other â indeed said count_of_monte_cristo with the same indomitable coolness let us see are you not the soldier m_fernand_mondego who deserted on the eve of the battle of waterloo are you not the lieutenant m_fernand_mondego who served as guide and spy to the french army in spain are you not the captain m_fernand_mondego who betrayed sold and murdered his benefactor ali_pasha_of_yanina
and have not all these fernands united made lieutenant general the count of viscount_albert_de_morcerf peer of france â_oh cried the general as if branded with a hot iron wretch to reproach me with my shame when about perhaps to kill me no i did not say i was a stranger to you i know well demon that you have penetrated into the darkness of the past and that you have read by the light of what torch i know not every page of my life but perhaps i may be more honorable in my shame than you under your pompous coverings noâ no i am aware you know me but i know you only as an adventurer sewn up in gold and jewellery you call yourself in paris the count_of_monte_cristo in italy sinbad the sailor in malta i forget what but it is your real name i want to know in the midst of your hundred name that i may pronounce it when we meet to fight at the moment when i plunge my sword through your heart the count_of_monte_cristo turned dreadfully pale his eye seemed to burn with a devouring fire he leaped towards a dressing room near his bedroom and in less than a moment tearing off his cravat his coat and waistcoat he put on a sailorâ jacket and hat from beneath which rolled his long black hair he returned thus formidable and implacable advancing with his arm crossed on his breast towards the general who could not understand why he had disappeared but who on seeing him again and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him drew back and only stopped when he found a table to support his clenched hand m_fernand_mondego cried he of my hundred name i need only
tell you one to overwhelm you but you guess it now do you not or rather you remember it for notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures i show you today a face which the happiness of revenge makes young againâ a face you must often have seen in your dreams since your marriage with mercã_dã_s my betrothed 40268m the general with his head thrown back hand extended gaze fixed looked silently at this dreadful apparition then seeking the wall to support him he glided along close to it until he reached the door through which he went out backwards uttering this single mournful lamentable distressing cry edmond_dantã_s then with sighs which were unlike any human sound he dragged himself to the door reeled across the courtyard and falling into the arm of his valet he said in a voice scarcely intelligible â home home the fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servant partly recalled his senses but the ride was short and as he drew near his house_of_peers all his wretchedness revived he stopped at a short distance from the house_of_peers and alighted the door was wide open a hackney coach was standing in the middle of the yardâ a strange sight before so noble a mansion the count looked at it with terror but without daring to inquire its meaning he rushed towards his apartment two person were coming down the stairs he had only time to creep into an alcove to avoid them it was mercã_dã_s leaning on her sonâ arm and leaving the house_of_peers they passed close by the unhappy being who concealed behind the damask curtain almost felt mercã_dã_s dress brush past him and his sonâ warm breath pronouncing these word courage mother
come this is no longer our home the word died away the step were lost in the distance the general drew himself up clinging to the curtain he uttered the most dreadful sob which ever escaped from the bosom of a father abandoned at the same time by his wife and son he soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the hackney coach then the coachmanâ voice and then the rolling of the heavy vehicle shook the window he darted to his bedroom to see once more all he had loved in the world but the hackney coach drove on and the head of neither mercã_dã_s nor her son appeared at the window to take a last look at the house_of_peers or the deserted father and husband and at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report was heard and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the window which was broken by the explosion 40270 chapter 93 mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort we may easily conceive where morrelâ appointment was on leaving count_of_monte_cristo he walked slowly towards villefortâ we say slowly for m_maximilian_morrel had more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred step but he had hastened to take leave of count_of_monte_cristo because he wished to be alone with his thoughts he knew his time wellâ the hour when mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort was giving m_noirtier_de_villefort his breakfast and was sure not to be disturbed in the performance of this pious duty m_noirtier_de_villefort and mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort had given him leave to go twice a week and he was now availing himself of that permission he arrived mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort was expecting him uneasy and almost crazed she seized his hand and led him to her grandfather
this uneasiness amounting almost to frenzy arose from the report morcerfâ adventure had made in the world for the affair at the opera was generally known no one at villefortâ doubted that a duel would ensue from it mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort with her womanâ instinct guessed that m_maximilian_morrel would be monte cristoâ second and from the young manâ well known courage and his great affection for the count she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to him we may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for given and received and m_maximilian_morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eye of his beloved when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was unexpected now said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort motioning to m_maximilian_morrel to sit down near her grandfather while she took her seat on his footstool â now let us talk about our own affairs you know m_maximilian_morrel grandpapa once thought of leaving this house_of_peers and taking an apartment away from de villefortâ â â_yes said m_maximilian_morrel i recollect the project of which i highly approved â well said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort you may approve again for grandpapa is again thinking of it â bravo said m_maximilian_morrel 40272m and do you know said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort what reason grandpapa gives for leaving this house_of_peers m_noirtier_de_villefort looked at mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort to impose silence but she did not notice him her look her eye her smile were all for m_maximilian_morrel â_oh whatever may be noirtierâ reason answered m_maximilian_morrel i can readily believe it to be a good one â an excellent one said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort he pretends the air of the faubourg saint honorã is not good for me â indeed said m_maximilian_morrel in that m_noirtier_de_villefort may be right you have not seemed to be well for the last fortnight
â not very said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and grandpapa has become my physician and i have the greatest confidence in him because he knows everything â do you then really suffer asked m_maximilian_morrel quickly â_oh it must not be called suffering i feel a general uneasiness that is all i have lost my appetite and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to something m_noirtier_de_villefort did not lose a word of what mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said and what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint â a very simple one said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort i swallow every morning a spoonful of the mixture prepared for my grandfather when i say one spoonful i began by oneâ now i take four grandpapa says it is a panacea mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort smiled but it was evident that she suffered m_maximilian_morrel in his devotedness gazed silently at her she was very beautiful but her usual pallor had increased her eye were more brilliant than ever and her hand which were generally white like mother of pearl now more resembled wax to which time was adding a yellowish hue from mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort the young man looked towards m_noirtier_de_villefort the latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl absorbed by her affection and he also like m_maximilian_morrel followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover but said m_maximilian_morrel i thought this mixture of which you now take four spoonfuls was prepared for m_noirtier_de_villefort â i know it is very bitter said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort so bitter that all i drink afterwards appears to have the same taste m_noirtier_de_villefort looked inquiringly at his granddaughter â_yes grandpapa said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â_it is so
just now before i came down to you i drank a glass of sugared water i left half because it seemed so bitter m_noirtier_de_villefort turned pale and made a sign that he wished to speak mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort rose to fetch the dictionary m_noirtier_de_villefort watched her with evident anguish in fact the blood was rushing to the young girlâ head already her cheeks were becoming red â_oh cried she without losing any of her cheerfulness this is singular i canâ see did the sun shine in my eye and she leaned against the window the sun is not shining said m_maximilian_morrel more alarmed by noirtierâ expression than by valentineâ indisposition he ran towards her the young girl smiled cheer up said she to m_noirtier_de_villefort do not be alarmed m_maximilian_morrel it is nothing and has already passed away but listen do i not hear a carriage in the courtyard she opened noirtierâ door ran to a window in the passage and returned hastily â_yes said she â_it is madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and her daughter who have come to call on us good bye i must run away for they would send here for me or rather farewell till i see you again stay with grandpapa m_maximilian_morrel i promise you not to persuade them to stay 40274 m_maximilian_morrel watched her as she left the room he heard her ascend the little staircase which led both to madame de villefortâ apartments and to hers as soon as she was gone m_noirtier_de_villefort made a sign to m_maximilian_morrel to take the dictionary m_maximilian_morrel obeyed guided by mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort he had learned how to understand the old man quickly
accustomed however as he was to the work he had to repeat most of the letter of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary so that it was ten minute before the thought of the old man was translated by these word fetch the glass of water and the decanter from valentineâ room m_maximilian_morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken barroisâ situation and in noirtierâ name gave that order the servant soon returned the decanter and the glass were completely empty m_noirtier_de_villefort made a sign that he wished to speak why are the glass and decanter empty asked he mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said she only drank half the glassful the translation of this new question occupied another five minute i do not know said the servant but the housemaid is in mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars valentineâ room perhaps she has emptied them â ask her said m_maximilian_morrel translating noirtierâ thought this time by his look the servant went out but returned almost immediately mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort passed through the room to go to madame de villefortâ â said he and in passing as she was thirsty she drank what remained in the glass as for the decanter master edward had emptied that to make a pond for his ducks m_noirtier_de_villefort raised his eye to heaven as a gambler does who stakes his all on one stroke from that moment the old manâ eye were fixed on the door and did not quit it it was indeed madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and her daughter whom mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort had seen they had been ushered into madame de villefortâ room who had said she would receive them there that is why mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort passed through her room which was on a level with valentineâ and only separated from it by edwardâ
the two ladies entered the drawing room with that sort of official stiffness which preludes a formal communication among worldly people manner is contagious madame m_noirtier_de_villefort received them with equal solemnity mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort entered at this moment and the formalities were resumed my dear friend said the baroness while the two young people were shaking hand i and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with prince m_andrea_cavalcanti mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars kept up the title of prince the popular banker found that it answered better than count allow me to present you my sincere congratulations replied madame m_noirtier_de_villefort prince m_andrea_cavalcanti appears to be a young man of rare qualities 40276m listen said the baroness smiling speaking to you as a friend i can say that the prince does not yet appear all he will be he has about him a little of that foreign manner by which french person recognize at first sight the italian or german nobleman besides he gives evidence of great kindness of disposition much keenness of wit and as to suitability mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars assures me that his fortune is majesticâ that is his word â and then said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars while turning over the leaves of madame de villefortâ album add that you have taken a great fancy to the young man â and said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort i need not ask you if you share that fancy â i replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with her usual candor â_oh not the least in the world madame my wish was not to confine myself to domestic cares or the caprices of any man but to be an artist and consequently free in heart in person and in thought mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars pronounced these word with so firm a tone that the color mounted to valentineâ cheeks
the timid girl could not understand that vigorous nature which appeared to have none of the timidities of woman at any rate said she since i am to be married whether i will or not i ought to be thankful to providence for having released me from my engagement with monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf or i should this day have been the wife of a dishonored man â_it is true said the baroness with that strange simplicity sometimes met with among fashionable ladies and of which plebeian intercourse can never entirely deprive them â_it is very true that had not the morcerfs hesitated my daughter would have married monsieur_albert the general depended much on it he even came to force mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars we have had a narrow escape â but said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort timidly does all the fatherâ shame revert upon the son monsieur_albert appears to me quite innocent of the treason charged against the general â excuse me said the implacable young girl monsieur_albert claims and well deserves his share it appears that after having challenged de count_of_monte_cristo at the opera yesterday he apologized on the ground today â impossible said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort ah my dear friend said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with the same simplicity we before noticed â_it is a fact i heard it from m_lucien_debray who was present at the explanation mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort also knew the truth but she did not answer a single word had reminded her that m_maximilian_morrel was expecting her in noirtierâ room deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort had ceased for a moment to join in the conversation
she would indeed have found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few minute when suddenly madame danglarsâ hand pressed on her arm aroused her from her lethargy what is it said she starting at madame danglarsâ touch as she would have done from an electric shock â_it is my dear mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said the baroness that you are doubtless suffering 40280m i said the young girl passing her hand across her burning forehead â_yes look at yourself in that glass you have turned pale and then red successively three or four time in one minute â indeed cried mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars you are very pale â_oh do not be alarmed i have been so for many day artless as she was the young girl knew that this was an opportunity to leave and besides madame m_noirtier_de_villefort came to her assistance retire mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said she you are really suffering and these ladies will excuse you drink a glass of pure water it will restore you mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort kissed mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars bowed to madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who had already risen to take her leave and went out that poor child said madame m_noirtier_de_villefort when mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort was gone she makes me very uneasy and i should not be astonished if she had some serious illness meanwhile mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort in a sort of excitement which she could not quite understand had crossed edwardâ room without noticing some trick of the child and through her own had reached the little staircase she was within three step of the bottom she already heard morrelâ voice when suddenly a cloud passed over her eye her stiffened foot missed the step her hand had no power to hold the baluster and falling against the wall she lost her balance wholly and toppled to the floor
morrel bounded to the door opened it and found mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort stretched out at the bottom of the stairs quick as a flash he raised her in his arm and placed her in a chair mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort opened her eye â_oh what a clumsy thing i am said she with feverish volubility i donâ know my way i forgot there were three more step before the landing â you have hurt yourself perhaps said m_maximilian_morrel what can i do for you mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort looked around her she saw the deepest terror depicted in noirtierâ eye donâ worry dear grandpapa said she endeavoring to smile â_it is nothingâ it is nothing i was giddy that is all â another attack of giddiness said m_maximilian_morrel clasping his hand â_oh attend to it mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort i entreat you â but no said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â no i tell you it is all past and it was nothing now let me tell you some news mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is to be married in a week and in three day there is to be a grand feast a betrothal festival we are all invited my father madame m_noirtier_de_villefort and iâ at least i understood it so â when will it be our turn to think of these thing oh mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort you who have so much influence over your grandpapa try to make him answerâ soon â and do you said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort depend on me to stimulate the tardiness and arouse the memory of grandpapa â_yes cried m_maximilian_morrel make haste so long as you are not mine mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort i shall always think i may lose you â_oh replied mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort with a convulsive movement â_oh indeed m_maximilian_morrel you are too timid for an officer for a soldier who they say never knows fear ha ha ha
she burst into a forced and melancholy laugh her arm stiffened and twisted her head fell back on her chair and she remained motionless the cry of terror which was stopped on noirtierâ lip seemed to start from his eye m_maximilian_morrel understood it he knew he must call assistance the young man rang the bell violently the housemaid who had been in mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars valentineâ room and the servant who had replaced barrois ran in at the same moment mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort was so pale so cold so inanimate that without listening to what was said to them they were seized with the fear which pervaded that house_of_peers and they flew into the passage crying for help madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars were going out at that moment they heard the cause of the disturbance i told you so exclaimed madame m_noirtier_de_villefort poor child 40278m chapter 94 maximilianâ avowal at the same moment de villefortâ voice was heard calling from his study what is the matter m_maximilian_morrel looked at m_noirtier_de_villefort who had recovered his self command and with a glance indicated the closet where once before under somewhat similar circumstances he had taken refuge he had only time to get his hat and throw himself breathless into the closet when the procureurâ footstep was heard in the passage m_noirtier_de_villefort sprang into the room ran to mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and took her in his arm a physician a physician m dâ avrigny cried m_noirtier_de_villefort or rather i will go for him myself he flew from the apartment and m_maximilian_morrel at the same moment darted out at the other door
he had been struck to the heart by a frightful recollectionâ the conversation he had heard between the doctor and m_noirtier_de_villefort the night of madame de saint mã ranâ death recurred to him these symptoms to a less alarming extent were the same which had preceded the death of barrois at the same time monte cristoâ voice seemed to resound in his ear with the word he had heard only two hour before whatever you want m_maximilian_morrel come to me i have great power more rapidly than thought he darted down the rue matignon and thence to the avenue des champs lysã es meanwhile m_noirtier_de_villefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at dâ avrignyâ door he rang so violently that the porter was alarmed m_noirtier_de_villefort ran upstairs without saying a word the porter knew him and let him pass only calling to him in his study monsieur_albert procureurâ in his study m_noirtier_de_villefort pushed or rather forced the door open ah said the doctor is it you â_yes said m_noirtier_de_villefort closing the door after him â_it is i who am come in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone doctor my house_of_peers is accursed â what said the latter with apparent coolness but with deep emotion have you another invalid â_yes doctor cried m_noirtier_de_villefort clutching his hair â_yes dâ avrignyâ look implied i told you it would be so then he slowly uttered these word who is now dying in your house_of_peers what new victim is going to accuse you of weakness before god a mournful sob burst from villefortâ heart he approached the doctor and seizing his arm â mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said he â_it is valentineâ turn 40284m your daughter cried dâ avrigny with grief and surprise
â you see you were deceived murmured the magistrate come and see her and on her bed of agony entreat her pardon for having suspected her â each time you have applied to me said the doctor â_it has been too late still i will go but let us make haste sir with the enemies you have to do with there is no time to be lost â_oh this time doctor you shall not have to reproach me with weakness this time i will know the assassin and will pursue him â let us try first to save the victim before we think of revenging her said dâ avrigny come the same cabriolet which had brought m_noirtier_de_villefort took them back at full speed and at this moment m_maximilian_morrel rapped at monte cristoâ door the count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which monsieur_bertuccio had brought in haste hearing the name of m_maximilian_morrel who had left him only two hour before the count raised his head arose and sprang to meet him what is the matter m_maximilian_morrel asked he you are pale and the perspiration rolls from your forehead m_maximilian_morrel fell into a chair â_yes said he i came quickly i wanted to speak to you â are all your family well asked the count with an affectionate benevolence whose sincerity no one could for a moment doubt thank you countâ thank you said the young man evidently embarrassed how to begin the conversation â_yes everyone in my family is well â so much the better yet you have something to tell me replied the count with increased anxiety â_yes said m_maximilian_morrel â_it is true i have but now left a house_of_peers where death has just entered to run to you â are you then come from de morcerfâ â asked count_of_monte_cristo
â no said m_maximilian_morrel is someone dead in his house_of_peers â the general has just blown his brains out replied count_of_monte_cristo with great coolness â_oh what a dreadful event cried m_maximilian_morrel not for the countess or for monsieur_albert said count_of_monte_cristo a dead father or husband is better than a dishonored one blood washes out shame â poor countess said m_maximilian_morrel i pity her very much she is so noble a woman â pity monsieur_albert also m_maximilian_morrel for believe me he is the worthy son of the countess but let us return to yourself you have hastened to meâ can i have the happiness of being useful to you 40286m â_yes i need your help that is i thought like a madman that you could lend me your assistance in a case where god alone can succor me â tell me what it is replied count_of_monte_cristo â_oh said m_maximilian_morrel i know not indeed if i may reveal this secret to mortal ears but fatality impels me necessity constrains me countâ â m_maximilian_morrel hesitated do you think i love you said count_of_monte_cristo taking the young manâ hand affectionately in his â_oh you encourage me and something tells me there placing his hand on his heart that i ought to have no secret from you â you are right m_maximilian_morrel god is speaking to your heart and your heart speaks to you tell me what it says â count will you allow me to send monsieur_baptistin to inquire after someone you know â i am at your service and still more my servant â_oh i cannot live if she is not better â shall i ring for monsieur_baptistin â no i will go and speak to him myself m_maximilian_morrel went out called monsieur_baptistin and whispered a few word to him the valet ran directly
â well have you sent asked count_of_monte_cristo seeing m_maximilian_morrel return â_yes and now i shall be more calm â you know i am waiting said count_of_monte_cristo smiling â_yes and i will tell you one evening i was in a garden a clump of trees concealed me no one suspected i was there two person passed near meâ allow me to conceal their name for the present they were speaking in an undertone and yet i was so interested in what they said that i did not lose a single word â this is a gloomy introduction if i may judge from your pallor and shuddering m_maximilian_morrel â_oh yes very gloomy my friend someone had just died in the house_of_peers to which that garden belonged one of the person whose conversation i overheard was the master of the house_of_peers the other the physician the former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear for it was the second time within a month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly entered that house_of_peers which was apparently destined to destruction by some exterminating angel as an object of godâ anger â ah indeed said count_of_monte_cristo looking earnestly at the young man and by an imperceptible movement turning his chair so that he remained in the shade while the light fell full on maximilianâ face â_yes continued m_maximilian_morrel death had entered that house_of_peers twice within one month â and what did the doctor answer asked count_of_monte_cristo he repliedâ he replied that the death was not a natural one and must be attributedâ â to what â to
poison â indeed said count_of_monte_cristo with a slight cough which in moment of extreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush or his pallor or the intense interest with which he listened indeed m_maximilian_morrel did you hear that â_yes my dear count i heard it and the doctor added that if another death occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice count_of_monte_cristo listened or appeared to do so with the greatest calmness well said m_maximilian_morrel death came a third time and neither the master of the house_of_peers nor the doctor said a word death is now perhaps striking a fourth blow count what am i bound to do being in possession of this secret â my dear friend said count_of_monte_cristo you appear to be relating an adventure which we all know by heart i know the house_of_peers where you heard it or one very similar to it a house_of_peers with a garden a master a physician and where there have been three unexpected and sudden death well i have not intercepted your confidence and yet i know all that as well as you and i have no conscientious scruples no it does not concern me you say an exterminating angel appears to have devoted that house_of_peers to godâ angerâ well who says your supposition is not reality do not notice thing which those whose interest it is to see them pass over if it is godâ justice instead of his anger which is walking through that house_of_peers m_maximilian_morrel turn away your face and let his justice accomplish its purpose m_maximilian_morrel shuddered there was something mournful solemn and terrible in the countâ manner besides
continued he in so changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person speakingâ besides who says that it will begin again â_it has returned count exclaimed m_maximilian_morrel that is why i hastened to you â well what do you wish me to do do you wish me for instance to give information to the procureur count_of_monte_cristo uttered the last word with so much meaning that m_maximilian_morrel starting up cried out you know of whom i speak count do you not â perfectly well my good friend and i will prove it to you by putting the dots to the i or rather by naming the person you were walking one evening in de villefortâ garden from what you relate i suppose it to have been the evening of madame de saint mã ranâ death you heard m_noirtier_de_villefort talking to dâ avrigny about the death of de madame_de_saint_mã_ran and that no less surprising of the countess dâ avrigny said he believed they both proceeded from poison and you honest man have ever since been asking your heart and sounding your conscience to know if you ought to expose or conceal this secret we are no longer in the middle ages there is no longer a vehmgericht or free tribunals what do you want to ask these people conscience what hast thou to do with me as sterne said my dear fellow let them sleep on if they are asleep let them grow pale in their drowsiness if they are disposed to do so and pray do you remain in peace who have no remorse to disturb you deep grief was depicted on morrelâ features he seized monte cristoâ hand but it is beginning again i say â well
said the count astonished at his perseverance which he could not understand and looking still more earnestly at m_maximilian_morrel let it begin again â_it is like the house_of_peers of the atreidae 19 god has condemned them and they must submit to their punishment they will all disappear like the fabrics child build with cards and which fall one by one under the breath of their builder even if there are two hundred of them three month since it was de madame_de_saint_mã_ran madame_de_saint_mã_ran two month since the other day it was barrois today the old m_noirtier_de_villefort or young mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â you knew it cried m_maximilian_morrel in such a paroxysm of terror that count_of_monte_cristo started he whom the falling heavens would have found unmoved you knew it and said nothing â and what is it to me replied count_of_monte_cristo shrugging his shoulders do i know those people and must i lose the one to save the other faith no for between the culprit and the victim i have no choice â but i cried m_maximilian_morrel groaning with sorrow i love her â you love whom cried count_of_monte_cristo starting to his foot and seizing the two hand which m_maximilian_morrel was raising towards heaven i love most fondlyâ i love madlyâ i love as a man who would give his life blood to spare her a tearâ i love mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort m_noirtier_de_villefort who is being murdered at this moment do you understand me i love her and i ask god and you how i can save her count_of_monte_cristo uttered a cry which those only can conceive who have heard the roar of a wounded lion unhappy man cried he wringing his hand in his turn you love mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort that daughter of an accursed race never had m_maximilian_morrel witnessed such an expressionâ never had
so terrible an eye flashed before his faceâ never had the genius of terror he had so often seen either on the battle field or in the murderous night of algeria shaken around him more dreadful fire he drew back terrified as for count_of_monte_cristo after this ebullition he closed his eye as if dazzled by internal light in a moment he restrained himself so powerfully that the tempestuous heaving of his breast subsided as turbulent and foaming waves yield to the sunâ genial influence when the cloud has passed this silence self control and struggle lasted about twenty seconds then the count raised his pallid face see said he my dear friend how god punishes the most thoughtless and unfeeling man for their indifference by presenting dreadful scenes to their view i who was looking on an eager and curious spectator i who was watching the working of this mournful tragedy i who like a wicked angel was laughing at the evil man committed protected by secrecy a secret is easily kept by the rich and powerful i am in my turn bitten by the serpent whose tortuous course i was watching and bitten to the heart m_maximilian_morrel groaned come come continued the count complaints are unavailing be a man be strong be full of hope for i am here and will watch over you m_maximilian_morrel shook his head sorrowfully i tell you to hope do you understand me cried count_of_monte_cristo remember that i never uttered a falsehood and am never deceived it is twelve oâ clock m_maximilian_morrel thank heaven that you came at noon rather than in the evening or tomorrow morning listen morrelâ it is noon if mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort is not now dead she will not die â how so cried m_maximilian_morrel when i left her dying count_of_monte_cristo pressed his hand to his forehead
what was passing in that brain so loaded with dreadful secrets what does the angel of light or the angel of darkness say to that mind at once implacable and generous god only knows count_of_monte_cristo raised his head once more and this time he was calm as a child awaking from its sleep m_maximilian_morrel said he return home i command you not to stirâ attempt nothing not to let your countenance betray a thought and i will send you tidings go â_oh count you overwhelm me with that coolness have you then power against death are you superhuman are you an angel and the young man who had never shrunk from danger shrank before count_of_monte_cristo with indescribable terror but count_of_monte_cristo looked at him with so melancholy and sweet a smile that m_maximilian_morrel felt the tears filling his eye i can do much for you my friend replied the count go i must be alone m_maximilian_morrel subdued by the extraordinary ascendancy count_of_monte_cristo exercised over everything around him did not endeavor to resist it he pressed the countâ hand and left he stopped one moment at the door for monsieur_baptistin whom he saw in the rue matignon and who was running meanwhile m_noirtier_de_villefort and dâ avrigny had made all possible haste mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival and the doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances demanded and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret intensified twofold m_noirtier_de_villefort closely watching his countenance and his lip awaited the result of the examination m_noirtier_de_villefort paler than even the young girl more eager than m_noirtier_de_villefort for the decision was watching also intently and affectionately
at last dâ avrigny slowly uttered these word she is still alive â still cried m_noirtier_de_villefort â_oh doctor what a dreadful word is that â_yes said the physician i repeat it she is still alive and i am astonished at it â but is she safe asked the father â_yes since she life at that moment dâ avrignyâ glance met noirtierâ eye it glistened with such extraordinary joy so rich and full of thought that the physician was struck he placed the young girl again on the chair her lip were scarcely discernible they were so pale and white as well as her whole face and remained motionless looking at m_noirtier_de_villefort who appeared to anticipate and commend all he did sir said dâ avrigny to m_noirtier_de_villefort call mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars valentineâ maid if you please m_noirtier_de_villefort went himself to find her and dâ avrigny approached m_noirtier_de_villefort have you something to tell me asked he the old man winked his eye expressively which we may remember was his only way of expressing his approval privately â_yes â well i will remain with you at this moment m_noirtier_de_villefort returned followed by the ladyâ maid and after her came madame m_noirtier_de_villefort what is the matter then with this dear child she has just left me and she complained of being indisposed but i did not think seriously of it the young woman with tears in her eye and every mark of affection of a true mother approached mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and took her hand dâ avrigny continued to look at m_noirtier_de_villefort he saw the eye of the old man dilate and become round his cheeks turn pale and tremble the perspiration stood in drops upon his forehead ah said he involuntarily following noirtierâ eye which were fixed on madame m_noirtier_de_villefort who repeated this poor child would be better in bed
come fanny we will put her to bed m dâ avrigny who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with m_noirtier_de_villefort expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could be done but he forbade that anything should be given to her except what he ordered they carried mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort away she had revived but could scarcely move or speak so shaken was her frame by the attack she had however just power to give one parting look to her grandfather who in losing her seemed to be resigning his very soul dâ avrigny followed the invalid wrote a prescription ordered m_noirtier_de_villefort to take a cabriolet go in person to a chemistâ to get the prescribed medicine bring it himself and wait for him in his daughterâ room then having renewed his injunction not to give mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort anything he went down again to m_noirtier_de_villefort shut the door carefully and after convincing himself that no one was listening do you said he know anything of this young ladyâ illness â_yes said the old man we have no time to lose i will question and do you answer me m_noirtier_de_villefort made a sign that he was ready to answer did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter â_yes dâ avrigny reflected a moment then approaching m_noirtier_de_villefort pardon what i am going to say added he but no indication should be neglected in this terrible situation did you see poor barrois die m_noirtier_de_villefort raised his eye to heaven do you know of what he died asked dâ avrigny placing his hand on noirtierâ shoulder â_yes replied the old man do you think he died a natural death a sort of smile was discernible on the motionless lip of m_noirtier_de_villefort
â then you have thought that barrois was poisoned â_yes â do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him â no â do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck barrois has now attacked mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â_yes â then will she die too asked dâ avrigny fixing his penetrating gaze on m_noirtier_de_villefort he watched the effect of this question on the old man no replied he with an air of triumph which would have puzzled the most clever diviner then you hope said dâ avrigny with surprise â_yes â what do you hope the old man made him understand with his eye that he could not answer ah yes it is true murmured dâ avrigny then turning to m_noirtier_de_villefort â do you hope the assassin will be tried â no â then you hope the poison will take no effect on mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â_yes â_it is no news to you added dâ avrigny to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her the old man made a sign that he entertained no doubt upon the subject then how do you hope mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort will escape m_noirtier_de_villefort kept his eye steadfastly fixed on the same spot dâ avrigny followed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle containing the mixture which he took every morning ah indeed said dâ avrigny struck with a sudden thought has it occurred to youâ m_noirtier_de_villefort did not let him finish â_yes said he to prepare her system to resist poison â_yes â by accustoming her by degreesâ â â_yes yes yes said m_noirtier_de_villefort delighted to be understood of course i had told you that there was brucine in the mixture i give you â_yes â and by accustoming her to that poison you have endeavored to neutralize the effect of a similar poison noirtierâ joy continued and you have succeeded exclaimed dâ avrigny
â without that precaution mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort would have died before assistance could have been procured the dose has been excessive but she has only been shaken by it and this time at any rate mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort will not die a superhuman joy expanded the old manâ eye which were raised towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude at this moment m_noirtier_de_villefort returned here doctor said he is what you sent me for â was this prepared in your presence â_yes replied the procureur have you not let it go out of your hand â no dâ avrigny took the bottle poured some drops of the mixture it contained in the hollow of his hand and swallowed them well said he let us go to mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort i will give instructions to everyone and you m_noirtier_de_villefort will yourself see that no one deviates from them 40294m at the moment when dâ avrigny was returning to valentineâ room accompanied by m_noirtier_de_villefort an italian priest of serious demeanor and calm and firm tone hired for his use the house_of_peers adjoining the hotel of m_noirtier_de_villefort no one knew how the three former tenants of that house_of_peers left it about two hour afterwards its foundation was reported to be unsafe but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing himself there with his modest furniture the same day at five oâ clock the lease was drawn up for three six or nine year by the new tenant who according to the rule of the proprietor paid six month in advance this new tenant who as we have said was an italian was called il signor giacomo abbã_busoni
workmen were immediately called in and that same night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of the tottering house_of_peers chapter 95 father and daughter we saw in a preceding chapter how madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars went formally to announce to madame m_noirtier_de_villefort the approaching marriage of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and m_andrea_cavalcanti this formal announcement which implied or appeared to imply the approval of all the person concerned in this momentous affair had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must be admitted we beg them to take one step backward and to transport themselves the morning of that day of great catastrophes into the showy gilded salon we have before shown them and which was the pride of its owner baron mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars in this room at about ten oâ clock in the morning the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some minute thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness watching both door and listening to every sound when his patience was exhausted he called his valet ã tienne said he see why mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars has asked me to meet her in the drawing room and why she makes me wait so long having given this vent to his ill humor the baron became more calm mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had that morning requested an interview with her father and had fixed on the gilded drawing room as the spot the singularity of this step and above all its formality had not a little surprised the banker who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawing room tienne soon returned from his errand mademoiselleâ ladyâ maid says sir that mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is finishing her toilette and will be here shortly mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars nodded to signify that he was satisfied
to the world and to his servant mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars assumed the character of the good natured man and the indulgent father this was one of his part in the popular comedy he was performing a make up he had adopted and which suited him about as well as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors who seen from one side were the image of geniality and from the other showed lip drawn down in chronic ill temper let us hasten to say that in private the genial side descended to the level of the other so that generally the indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal husband and domineering father why the devil does that foolish girl who pretends to wish to speak to me not come into my study and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all he was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time when the door opened and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars appeared attired in a figured black satin dress her hair dressed and gloves on as if she were going to the italian opera well mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars what is it you want with me and why in this solemn drawing room when the study is so comfortable â i quite understand why you ask sir said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars making a sign that her father might be seated and in fact your two questions suggest fully the theme of our conversation i will answer them both and contrary to the usual method the last first because it is the least difficult i have chosen the drawing room sir as our place of meeting in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a bankerâ study those gilded cashbooks drawers locked like gates of fortresses heaps of bank bills come from
i know not where and the quantities of letter from england holland spain india china and peru have generally a strange influence on a fatherâ mind and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents i have therefore chosen this drawing room where you see smiling and happy in their magnificent frames your portrait mine my motherâ and all sorts of rural landscapes and touching pastorals i rely much on external impressions perhaps with regard to you they are immaterial but i should be no artist if i had not some fancies â very well replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who had listened to all this preamble with imperturbable coolness but without understanding a word since like every man burdened with thoughts of the past he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own idea in those of the speaker there is then the second point cleared up or nearly so said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars without the least confusion and with that masculine pointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language and you appear satisfied with the explanation now let us return to the first you ask me why i have requested this interview i will tell you in two word sir i will not marry count m_andrea_cavalcanti mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eye and arm towards heaven 40298m â_yes indeed sir continued mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars still quite calm you are astonished i see for since this little affair began i have not manifested the slightest opposition and yet i am always sure when the opportunity arrives to oppose a determined and absolute will to people who have not consulted me and thing which displease me
however this time my tranquillity or passiveness as philosophers say proceeded from another source it proceeded from a wish like a submissive and devoted daughterâ a slight smile was observable on the purple lip of the young girl to practice obedience â well asked mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars well sir replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come i feel in spite of all my efforts that it is impossible â but said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic marking evident premeditation and force of will what is your reason for this refusal mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars what reason do you assign â my reason replied the young girl well it is not that the man is more ugly more foolish or more disagreeable than any other no m_andrea_cavalcanti may appear to those who look at menâ face and figures as a very good specimen of his kind it is not either that my heart is less touched by him than any other that would be a schoolgirlâ reason which i consider quite beneath me i actually love no one sir you know it do you not i do not then see why without real necessity i should encumber my life with a perpetual companion has not some sage said nothing too muchâ and another i carry all my effects with meâ i have been taught these two aphorisms in latin and in greek one is i believe from phã drus and the other from bias
well my dear father in the shipwreck of lifeâ for life is an eternal shipwreck of our hopesâ i cast into the sea my useless encumbrance that is all and i remain with my own will disposed to live perfectly alone and consequently perfectly free â unhappy girl unhappy girl murmured mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars turning pale for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly encountered unhappy girl replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars unhappy girl do you say sir no indeed the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected happy on the contrary for what am i in want of the world calls me beautiful it is something to be well received i like a favorable reception it expands the countenance and those around me do not then appear so ugly i possess a share of wit and a certain relative sensibility which enables me to draw from life in general for the support of mine all i meet with that is good like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its contents i am rich for you have one of the first fortune in france i am your only daughter and you are not so exacting as the father of the porte saint martin and gaã tã who disinherit their daughter for not giving them grandchildren besides the provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me at least entirely as it has also of the power to compel me to marry monsieur_albert this or monsieur_albert that and soâ being beautiful witty somewhat talented as the comic operas say and richâ and that is happiness sirâ why do you call me unhappy mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars seeing his daughter smiling and proud even to insolence could not entirely repress his brutal feelings but they betrayed themselves only by an exclamation
under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows he prudently turned away and calmed himself immediately daunted by the power of a resolute mind truly my daughter replied he with a smile you are all you boast of being excepting one thing i will not too hastily tell you which but would rather leave you to guess it mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars looked at mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride with which she had so superbly decked herself should be disputed my daughter continued the banker you have perfectly explained to me the sentiments which influence a girl like you who is determined she will not marry now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father like me who has decided that his daughter shall marry mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars bowed not as a submissive daughter but as an adversary prepared for a discussion my daughter continued mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband he has always some reason for wishing her to marry some are affected with the mania of which you spoke just now that of living again in their grandchildren this is not my weakness i tell you at once family joys have no charm for me i may acknowledge this to a daughter whom i know to be philosophical enough to understand my indifference and not to impute it to me as a crime â this is not to the purpose said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars let us speak candidly sir i admire candor â_oh said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i can when circumstances render it desirable adopt your system although it may not be my general practice i will therefore proceed i have proposed to you to marry not for your sake for indeed
i did not think of you in the least at the moment you admire candor and will now be satisfied i hope but because it suited me to marry you as soon as possible on account of certain commercial speculations i am desirous of entering into mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars became uneasy 40302m â_it is just as i tell you i assure you and you must not be angry with me for you have sought this disclosure i do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you who fears to enter my study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or anti poetic impressions and sensations but in that same bankerâ study where you very willingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand franc i give you monthly for pocket money you must know my dear young lady that many thing may be learned useful even to a girl who will not marry there one may learn for instance what out of regard to your nervous susceptibility i will inform you of in the drawing room namely that the credit of a banker is his physical and moral life that credit sustains him as breath animates the body and de count_of_monte_cristo once gave me a lecture on that subject which i have never forgotten there we may learn that as credit sinks the body becomes a corpse and this is what must happen very soon to the banker who is proud to own so good a logician as you for his daughter but mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars instead of stooping drew herself up under the blow ruined said she
â exactly my daughter that is precisely what i mean said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars almost digging his nails into his breast while he preserved on his harsh features the smile of the heartless though clever man ruinedâ yes that is it â ah said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â_yes ruined now it is revealed this secret so full of horror as the tragic poet says now my daughter learn from my lip how you may alleviate this misfortune so far as it will affect you â_oh cried mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars you are a bad physiognomist if you imagine i deplore on my own account the catastrophe of which you warn me i ruined and what will that signify to me have i not my talent left can i not like pasta malibran grisi acquire for myself what you would never have given me whatever might have been your fortune a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand livres per annum for which i shall be indebted to no one but myself and which instead of being given as you gave me those poor twelve thousand franc with sour look and reproaches for my prodigality will be accompanied with acclamations with bravos and with flowers and if i do not possess that talent which your smile prove to me you doubt should i not still have that ardent love of independence which will be a substitute for wealth and which in my mind supersedes even the instinct of self preservation no i grieve not on my own account i shall always find a resource my books my pencils my piano all the thing which cost but little and which i shall be able to procure will remain my own do you think that i sorrow for madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars
undeceive yourself again either i am greatly mistaken or she has provided against the catastrophe which threatens you and which will pass over without affecting her she has taken care for herself at least i hope so for her attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over me she has fostered my independence by professedly indulging my love for liberty oh no sir from my childhood i have seen too much and understood too much of what has passed around me for misfortune to have an undue power over me from my earliest recollections i have been beloved by no oneâ so much the worse that has naturally led me to love no oneâ so much the betterâ now you have my profession of faith â then said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars pale with anger which was not at all due to offended paternal love â then mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars you persist in your determination to accelerate my ruin â your ruin i accelerate your ruin what do you mean i do not understand you â so much the better i have a ray of hope left listen â i am all attention said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars looking so earnestly at her father that it was an effort for the latter to endure her unrelenting gaze m_andrea_cavalcanti continued mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is about to marry you and will place in my hand his fortune amounting to three million livres â that is admirable said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with sovereign contempt smoothing her gloves out one upon the other you think i shall deprive you of those three millions said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars but do not fear it they are destined to produce at least ten
i and a brother banker have obtained a grant of a railway the only industrial enterprise which in these day promises to make good the fabulous prospects that law once held out to the eternally deluded parisians in the fantastic mississippi scheme as i look at it a millionth part of a railway is worth fully as much as an acre of waste land on the banks of the ohio we make in our case a deposit on a mortgage which is an advance as you see since we gain at least ten fifteen twenty or a hundred livresâ worth of iron in exchange for our money well within a week i am to deposit four millions for my share the four millions i promise you will produce ten or twelve â but during my visit to you the day before yesterday sir which you appear to recollect so well replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i saw you arranging a depositâ is not that the term of five millions and a half you even pointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury and you were astonished that so valuable a paper did not dazzle my eye like lightning â_yes but those five millions and a half are not mine and are only a proof of the great confidence placed in me my title of popular banker has gained me the confidence of charitable institutions and the five millions and a half belong to them at any other time i should not have hesitated to make use of them but the great losses i have recently sustained are well known and as i told you my credit is rather shaken
that deposit may be at any moment withdrawn and if i had employed it for another purpose i should bring on me a disgraceful bankruptcy i do not despise bankruptcies believe me but they must be those which enrich not those which ruin now if you marry m_andrea_cavalcanti and i get the three millions or even if it is thought i am going to get them my credit will be restored and my fortune which for the last month or two has been swallowed up in gulfs which have been opened in my path by an inconceivable fatality will revive do you understand me â perfectly you pledge me for three millions do you not â the greater the amount the more flattering it is to you it gives you an idea of your value â thank you one word more sir do you promise me to make what use you can of the report of the fortune m_andrea_cavalcanti will bring without touching the money this is no act of selfishness but of delicacy i am willing to help rebuild your fortune but i will not be an accomplice in the ruin of others â but since i tell you cried mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars that with these three millionâ â do you expect to recover your position sir without touching those three million â i hope so if the marriage should take place and confirm my credit â shall you be able to pay m_andrea_cavalcanti the five hundred thousand franc you promise for my dowry â he shall receive them on returning from the mayorâ s20 â very well â what next what more do you want â i wish to know if in demanding my signature you leave me entirely free in my person â absolutely â then as i said before sir very
well i am ready to marry m_andrea_cavalcanti â but what are you up to â ah that is my affair what advantage should i have over you if knowing your secret i were to tell you mine mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars bit his lip then said he you are ready to pay the official visits which are absolutely indispensable â_yes replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and to sign the contract in three day â_yes â then in my turn i also say very well mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars pressed his daughterâ hand in his but extraordinary to relate the father did not say thank you my child nor did the daughter smile at her father is the conference ended asked mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars rising mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars motioned that he had nothing more to say five minute afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars dâ armillyâ fingers and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was singing brabantioâ malediction on desdemona at the end of the piece tienne entered and announced to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars that the horse were to the carriage and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her visits we have seen them at villefortâ they proceeded then on their course 40306m volume five 50009m 50011m 50019m chapter 96 the contract three day after the scene we have just described namely towards five oâ clock in the afternoon of the day fixed for the signature of the contract between mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and m_andrea_cavalcanti whom the banker persisted in calling prince a fresh breeze was stirring the leaves in the little garden in front of the count of monte cristoâ house_of_peers and the count was preparing to go out
while his horse were impatiently pawing the ground held in by the coachman who had been seated a quarter of an hour on his box the elegant phaeton with which we are familiar rapidly turned the angle of the entrance gate and cast out on the doorsteps m_andrea_cavalcanti as decked up and gay as if he were going to marry a princess he inquired after the count with his usual familiarity and ascending lightly to the first story met him at the top of the stairs the count stopped on seeing the young man as for m_andrea_cavalcanti he was launched and when he was once launched nothing stopped him ah good morning my dear count said he ah m_andrea_cavalcanti said the latter with his half jesting tone how do you do â charmingly as you see i am come to talk to you about a thousand thing but first tell me were you going out or just returned â i was going out sir â then in order not to hinder you i will get up with you if you please in your carriage and tom shall follow with my phaeton in tow â no said the count with an imperceptible smile of contempt for he had no wish to be seen in the young manâ society â no i prefer listening to you here my dear m_andrea_cavalcanti we can chat better in door and there is no coachman to overhear our conversation the count returned to a small drawing room on the first floor sat down and crossing his legs motioned to the young man to take a seat also m_andrea_cavalcanti assumed his gayest manner you know my dear count said he the ceremony is to take place this evening
at nine oâ clock the contract is to be signed at my father in lawâ â ah indeed said count_of_monte_cristo what is it news to you has not mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars informed you of the ceremony â_oh yes said the count i received a letter from him yesterday but i do not think the hour was mentioned â possibly my father in law trusted to its general notoriety â well said count_of_monte_cristo you are fortunate m_andrea_cavalcanti it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is a handsome girl â_yes indeed she is replied m_andrea_cavalcanti in a very modest tone above all she is very rich at least i believe so said count_of_monte_cristo very rich do you think replied the young man doubtless it is said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars conceals at least half of his fortune â and he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions said m_andrea_cavalcanti with a look sparkling with joy without reckoning added count_of_monte_cristo that he is on the eve of entering into a sort of speculation already in vogue in the united states and in england but quite novel in france â_yes yes i know what you mean the railway of which he has obtained the grant is it not â precisely it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that affair â ten millions do you think so it is magnificent said m_andrea_cavalcanti who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden word without reckoning replied count_of_monte_cristo that all his fortune will come to you and justly too since mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is an only daughter besides your own fortune as your father assured me is almost equal to that of your betrothed but enough of money matters
do you know m_andrea_cavalcanti i think you have managed this affair rather skilfully â not badly by any means said the young man i was born for a diplomatist â well you must become a diplomatist diplomacy you know is something that is not to be acquired it is instinctive have you lost your heart â indeed i fear it replied m_andrea_cavalcanti in the tone in which he had heard dorante or valã re reply to alceste21 at the thã tre franã ais is your love returned â i suppose so said m_andrea_cavalcanti with a triumphant smile since i am accepted but i must not forget one grand point â which â that i have been singularly assisted â nonsense â i have indeed â by circumstances â no by you â by me not at all prince said count_of_monte_cristo laying a marked stress on the title what have i done for you are not your name your social position and your merit sufficient â no said m_andrea_cavalcanti â no it is useless for you to say so count i maintain that the position of a man like you has done more than my name my social position and my merit â you are completely mistaken sir said count_of_monte_cristo coldly who felt the perfidious manå uvre of the young man and understood the bearing of his word you only acquired my protection after the influence and fortune of your father had been ascertained for after all who procured for me who had never seen either you or your illustrious father the pleasure of your acquaintance two of my good friend lord_wilmore and the abbã_busoni what encouraged me not to become your surety but to patronize you your fatherâ name so well known in italy and so highly honored personally i do not know you
this calm tone and perfect ease made m_andrea_cavalcanti feel that he was for the moment restrained by a more muscular hand than his own and that the restraint could not be easily broken through â_oh then my father has really a very large fortune count â_it appears so sir replied count_of_monte_cristo do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come â i have been advised of it â but the three millions â the three millions are probably on the road â then i shall really have them â_oh well said the count i do not think you have yet known the want of money m_andrea_cavalcanti was so surprised that he pondered the matter for a moment then arousing from his reverie now sir i have one request to make to you which you will understand even if it should be disagreeable to you â proceed said count_of_monte_cristo i have formed an acquaintance thanks to my good fortune with many noted person and have at least for the moment a crowd of friend but marrying as i am about to do before all paris i ought to be supported by an illustrious name and in the absence of the paternal hand some powerful one ought to lead me to the altar now my father is not coming to paris is he â he is old covered with wounds and suffers dreadfully he says in travelling â i understand well i am come to ask a favor of you â of me â_yes of you â and pray what may it be â well to take his part â ah my dear sir what after the varied relations i have had the happiness to sustain towards you can it be that you know me so little as to ask such a thing
ask me to lend you half a million and although such a loan is somewhat rare on my honor you would annoy me less know then what i thought i had already told you that in participation in this worldâ affairs more especially in their moral aspects the count_of_monte_cristo has never ceased to entertain the scruples and even the superstitions of the east i who have a seraglio at cairo one at smyrna and one at constantinople preside at a wedding never â then you refuse me â decidedly and were you my son or my brother i would refuse you in the same way â but what must be done said m_andrea_cavalcanti disappointed you said just now that you had a hundred friend â very true but you introduced me at danglarsâ â not at all let us recall the exact facts you met him at a dinner party at my house_of_peers and you introduced yourself at his house_of_peers that is a totally different affair â_yes but by my marriage you have forwarded that â i not in the least i beg you to believe recollect what i told you when you asked me to propose you â_oh i never make matches my dear prince it is my settled principle â m_andrea_cavalcanti bit his lip 50025m but at least you will be there â will all paris be there â_oh certainly â well like all paris i shall be there too said the count and will you sign the contract â i see no objection to that my scruples do not go thus far â well since you will grant me no more i must be content with what you give me
but one word more count â what is it â advice â be careful advice is worse than a service â_oh you can give me this without compromising yourself â tell me what it is â is my wifeâ fortune five hundred thousand livres â that is the sum mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars himself announced â must i receive it or leave it in the hand of the notary â this is the way such affairs are generally arranged when it is wished to do them stylishly your two solicitors appoint a meeting when the contract is signed for the next or the following day then they exchange the two portions for which they each give a receipt then when the marriage is celebrated they place the amount at your disposal as the chief member of the alliance â because said m_andrea_cavalcanti with a certain ill concealed uneasiness i thought i heard my father in law say that he intended embarking our property in that famous railway affair of which you spoke just now â well replied count_of_monte_cristo â_it will be the way everybody says of trebling your fortune in twelve month baron mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is a good father and knows how to calculate â in that case said m_andrea_cavalcanti everything is all right excepting your refusal which quite grieves me â you must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar circumstances â well said m_andrea_cavalcanti let it be as you wish this evening then at nine oâ clock â adieu till then notwithstanding a slight resistance on the part of count_of_monte_cristo whose lip turned pale but who preserved his ceremonious smile m_andrea_cavalcanti seized the countâ hand pressed it jumped into his phaeton and disappeared
the four or five remaining hour before nine oâ clock arrived m_andrea_cavalcanti employed in riding paying visits designed to induce those of whom he had spoken to appear at the bankerâ in their gayest equipages dazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have since turned every brain and in which mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was just taking the initiative in fact at half past eight in the evening the grand salon the gallery adjoining and the three other drawing room on the same floor were filled with a perfumed crowd who sympathized but little in the event but who all participated in that love of being present wherever there is anything fresh to be seen an academician would say that the entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of flowers which attract inconstant butterflies famished bees and buzzing drones 50025 no one could deny that the room were splendidly illuminated the light streamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings and all the bad taste of decorations which had only their richness to boast of shone in its splendor mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was dressed with elegant simplicity in a figured white silk dress and a white rose half concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament unaccompanied by a single jewel her eye however betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was chatting at a short distance with m_lucien_debray m_beauchamp and baron_de_chã_teau_renaud m_lucien_debray was admitted to the house_of_peers for this grand ceremony but on the same plane with everyone else and without any particular privilege mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars surrounded by deputies and man connected with the revenue was explaining a new theory of taxation which he intended to adopt when the course of events had compelled the government to call him into the ministry
andrea on whose arm hung one of the most consummate dandies of the opera was explaining to him rather cleverly since he was obliged to be bold to appear at ease his future projects and the new luxuries he meant to introduce to parisian fashions with his hundred and seventy five thousand livres per annum the crowd moved to and fro in the room like an ebb and flow of turquoises rubies emeralds opals and diamonds as usual the oldest woman were the most decorated and the ugliest the most conspicuous if there was a beautiful lily or a sweet rose you had to search for it concealed in some corner behind a mother with a turban or an aunt with a bird of paradise at each moment in the midst of the crowd the buzzing and the laughter the door keeperâ voice was heard announcing some name well known in the financial department respected in the army or illustrious in the literary world and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different groups but for one whose privilege it was to agitate that ocean of human waves how many were received with a look of indifference or a sneer of disdain at the moment when the hand of the massive time piece representing endymion asleep pointed to nine on its golden face and the hammer the faithful type of mechanical thought struck nine time the name of the count_of_monte_cristo resounded in its turn and as if by an electric shock all the assembly turned towards the door the count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his face
his only jewellery was a chain so fine that the slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat a circle was immediately formed around the door the count perceived at one glance madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars at one end of the drawing room mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars at the other and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars in front of him he first advanced towards the baroness who was chatting with madame m_noirtier_de_villefort who had come alone mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort being still an invalid and without turning aside so clear was the road left for him he passed from the baroness to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars whom he complimented in such rapid and measured terms that the proud artist was quite struck near her was mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly dâ armilly who thanked the count for the letter of introduction he had so kindly given her for italy which she intended immediately to make use of on leaving these ladies he found himself with mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who had advanced to meet him having accomplished these three social duties count_of_monte_cristo stopped looking around him with that expression peculiar to a certain class which seems to say i have done my duty now let others do theirs m_andrea_cavalcanti who was in an adjoining room had shared in the sensation caused by the arrival of count_of_monte_cristo and now came forward to pay his respects to the count he found him completely surrounded all were eager to speak to him as is always the case with those whose word are few and weighty the solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged their scrawled paper on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which covered the table prepared for the signature it was a gilt table supported on lionsâ claws one of the notaries sat down the other remained standing
they were about to proceed to the reading of the contract which half paris assembled was to sign all took their place or rather the ladies formed a circle while the gentlemen more indifferent to the restraints of what boileau calls the style nergique commented on the feverish agitation of m_andrea_cavalcanti on danglarsâ riveted attention eugã nieâ composure and the light and sprightly manner in which the baroness treated this important affair the contract was read during a profound silence but as soon as it was finished the buzz was redoubled through all the drawing room the brilliant sums the rolling millions which were to be at the command of the two young people and which crowned the display of the wedding presents and the young ladyâ diamonds which had been made in a room entirely appropriated for that purpose had exercised to the full their delusions over the envious assembly mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars danglarsâ charms were heightened in the opinion of the young man and for the moment seemed to outvie the sun in splendor as for the ladies it is needless to say that while they coveted the millions they thought they did not need them for themselves as they were beautiful enough without them m_andrea_cavalcanti surrounded by his friend complimented flattered beginning to believe in the reality of his dream was almost bewildered the notary solemnly took the pen flourished it above his head and said gentlemen we are about to sign the contract the baron was to sign first then the representative of m_andrea_cavalcanti senior then the baroness afterwards the future couple as they are styled in the abominable phraseology of legal documents the baron took the pen and signed then the representative the baroness approached leaning on madame de villefortâ arm my
dear said she as she took the pen is it not vexatious an unexpected incident in the affair of murder and theft at the count of monte cristoâ in which he nearly fell a victim deprives us of the pleasure of seeing m_noirtier_de_villefort â indeed said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars in the same tone in which he would have said â_oh well what do i care â as a matter of fact said count_of_monte_cristo approaching i am much afraid that i am the involuntary cause of his absence â what you count said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars signing if you are take care for i shall never forgive you m_andrea_cavalcanti pricked up his ears but it is not my fault as i shall endeavor to prove everyone listened eagerly count_of_monte_cristo who so rarely opened his lip was about to speak you remember said the count during the most profound silence that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house_of_peers the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice on attempting to leave it â_yes said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars in order that his wounds might be examined he was undressed and his clothes were thrown into a corner where the police picked them up with the exception of the waistcoat which they overlooked m_andrea_cavalcanti turned pale and drew towards the door he saw a cloud rising in the horizon which appeared to forebode a coming storm well this waistcoat was discovered today covered with blood and with a hole over the heart the ladies screamed and two or three prepared to faint â_it was brought to me no one could guess what the dirty rag could be i alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the murdered man
my valet in examining this mournful relic felt a paper in the pocket and drew it out it was a letter addressed to you baron â to me cried mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â_yes indeed to you i succeeded in deciphering your name under the blood with which the letter was stained replied count_of_monte_cristo amid the general outburst of amazement but asked madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars looking at her husband with uneasiness how could that prevent de villefortâ â in this simple way madame replied count_of_monte_cristo the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence i therefore sent them to the kingâ attorney you understand my dear baron that legal methods are the safest in criminal cases it was perhaps some plot against you m_andrea_cavalcanti looked steadily at count_of_monte_cristo and disappeared in the second drawing room possibly said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was not this murdered man an old galley slave 50025m â_yes replied the count a felon named m_caderousse mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars turned slightly pale m_andrea_cavalcanti reached the anteroom beyond the little drawing room but go on signing said count_of_monte_cristo i perceive that my story has caused a general emotion and i beg to apologize to you baroness and to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars the baroness who had signed returned the pen to the notary prince m_andrea_cavalcanti said the latter prince m_andrea_cavalcanti where are you â m_andrea_cavalcanti andrea_rondolo repeated several young people who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his christian name call the prince inform him that it is his turn to sign cried mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars to one of the floorkeepers but at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments quã rens quem devoret there was indeed reason to retreat to be alarmed and to scream
an officer was placing two soldiers at the door of each drawing room and was advancing towards mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars preceded by a commissary of police girded with his scarf madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars uttered a scream and fainted mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who thought himself threatened certain consciences are never calm mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars even before his guests showed a countenance of abject terror what is the matter sir asked count_of_monte_cristo advancing to meet the commissioner which of you gentlemen asked the magistrate without replying to the count answers to the name of m_andrea_cavalcanti a cry of astonishment was heard from all part of the room they searched they questioned but who then is m_andrea_cavalcanti asked mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars in amazement a galley slave escaped from confinement at toulon â and what crime has he committed â he is accused said the commissary with his inflexible voice of having assassinated the man named m_caderousse his former companion in prison at the moment he was making his escape from the house_of_peers of the count_of_monte_cristo count_of_monte_cristo cast a rapid glance around him m_andrea_cavalcanti was gone chapter 97 the departure for belgium a few minute after the scene of confusion produced in the salons of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers and by the disclosure which had followed the mansion was deserted with as much rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken out among the guests in a few minute through all the door down all the staircases by every exit everyone hastened to retire or rather to fly for it was a situation where the ordinary condolences which even the best friend are so eager to offer in great catastrophes were seen to be utterly futile
there remained in the bankerâ house_of_peers only mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars closeted in his study and making his statement to the officer of gendarmes madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars terrified in the boudoir with which we are acquainted and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who with haughty air and disdainful lip had retired to her room with her inseparable companion mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly dâ armilly as for the numerous servant more numerous that evening than usual for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the cafã de paris venting on their employers their anger at what they termed the insult to which they had been subjected they collected in groups in the hall in the kitchens or in their room thinking very little of their duty which was thus naturally interrupted of all this household only two person deserve our notice these are mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly dâ armilly the betrothed had retired as we said with haughty air disdainful lip and the demeanor of an outraged queen followed by her companion who was paler and more disturbed than herself on reaching her room mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars locked her door while mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly fell on a chair ah what a dreadful thing said the young musician who would have suspected it m_andrea_cavalcanti a murdererâ a galley slave escapedâ a convict an ironical smile curled the lip of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars in truth i was fated said she i escaped the viscount_albert_de_morcerf only to fall into the m_andrea_cavalcanti â_oh do not confound the two mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â hold your tongue the man are all infamous and i am happy to be able now to do more than detest themâ i despise them â what shall we do asked mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly what shall we do â_yes â why the same we had intended doing three day sinceâ set off â what although you are not now going to be married you intend stillâ â listen mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly

i am tired of hearing only of market reports of the end of the month of the rise and fall of spanish funds of haitian bonds instead of that louiseâ do you understand air liberty melody of birds plains of lombardy venetian canals roman palaces the bay of naples how much have we mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly the young girl to whom this question was addressed drew from an inlaid secretaire a small portfolio with a lock in which she counted twenty three bank notes twenty three thousand franc said she and as much at least in pearls diamonds and jewels said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars we are rich with forty five thousand franc we can live like princesses for two year and comfortably for four but before six monthsâ you with your music and i with my voiceâ we shall double our capital come you shall take charge of the money i of the jewel box so that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure the other would still have hers left now the portmanteauâ let us make hasteâ the portmanteau â stop said mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly going to listen at madame danglarsâ door what do you fear â that we may be discovered â the door is locked â they may tell us to open it â they may if they like but we will not â you are a perfect amazon mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and the two young girl began to heap into a trunk all the thing they thought they should require there now said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars while i change my costume do you lock the portmanteau mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly pressed with all the strength of her little hand on the top of the portmanteau but i cannot said she i am not strong enough do you shut it â ah you do well to ask said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars laughing
â i forgot that i was hercules and you only the pale omphale and the young girl kneeling on the top pressed the two part of the portmanteau together and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars dâ armilly passed the bolt of the padlock through when this was done mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars opened a drawer of which she kept the key and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak here said she you see i have thought of everything with this cloak you will not be cold â but you â_oh i am never cold you know besides with these menâ clothesâ â will you dress here â certainly â shall you have time â do not be uneasy you little coward all our servant are busy discussing the grand affair besides what is there astonishing when you think of the grief i ought to be in that i shut myself up tell me â no trulyâ you comfort me â come and help me from the same drawer she took a manâ complete costume from the boots to the coat and a provision of linen where there was nothing superfluous but every requisite then with a promptitude which indicated that this was not the first time she had amused herself by adopting the garb of the opposite sex mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars drew on the boots and pantaloons tied her cravat buttoned her waistcoat up to the throat and put on a coat which admirably fitted her beautiful figure â_oh that is very goodâ indeed it is very good said mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly looking at her with admiration but that beautiful black hair those magnificent braids which made all the ladies sigh with envy will they go under a manâ hat like the one i see down there â you shall see said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars
and with her left hand seizing the thick mass which her long fingers could scarcely grasp she took in her right hand a pair of long scissors and soon the steel met through the rich and splendid hair which fell in a cluster at her foot as she leaned back to keep it from her coat then she grasped the front hair which she also cut off without expressing the least regret on the contrary her eye sparkled with greater pleasure than usual under her ebony eyebrows 50039m â_oh the magnificent hair said mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly with regret and am i not a hundred time better thus cried mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars smoothing the scattered curls of her hair which had now quite a masculine appearance and do you not think me handsomer so â_oh you are beautifulâ always beautiful cried mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly now where are you going â to brussels if you like it is the nearest frontier we can go to brussels liã ge aix la chapelle then up the rhine to strasbourg we will cross switzerland and go down into italy by the saint gothard will that do â_yes â what are you looking at â i am looking at you indeed you are adorable like that one would say you were carrying me off â and they would be right pardieu â_oh i think you swore mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and the two young girl whom everyone might have thought plunged in grief the one on her own account the other from interest in her friend burst out laughing as they cleared away every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally accompanied the preparations for their escape
then having blown out the light the two fugitives looking and listening eagerly with outstretched necks opened the door of a dressing room which led by a side staircase down to the yard mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars going first and holding with one arm the portmanteau which by the opposite handle mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars dâ armilly scarcely raised with both hand the yard was empty the clock was striking twelve the porter was not yet gone to bed mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars approached softly and saw the old man sleeping soundly in an armchair in his lodge she returned to mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly took up the portmanteau which she had placed for a moment on the ground and they reached the archway under the shadow of the wall mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars concealed mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly in an angle of the gateway so that if the porter chanced to awake he might see but one person then placing herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard gate cried she with her finest contralto voice and rapping at the window the porter got up as mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars expected and even advanced some step to recognize the person who was going out but seeing a young man striking his boot impatiently with his riding whip he opened it immediately mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly slid through the half open gate like a snake and bounded lightly forward mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars apparently calm although in all probability her heart beat somewhat faster than usual went out in her turn a porter was passing and they gave him the portmanteau then the two young girl having told him to take it to no 36 rue de la victoire walked behind this man whose presence comforted mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly as for mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars she was as strong as a judith or a delilah they arrived at the appointed spot
eugã nie ordered the porter to put down the portmanteau gave him some pieces of money and having rapped at the shutter sent him away the shutter where mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had rapped was that of a little laundress who had been previously warned and was not yet gone to bed she opened the door mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars let the porter get the post chaise from the coach house_of_peers and fetch some post horse from the hotel here are five franc for his trouble â indeed said mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly i admire you and i could almost say respect you the laundress looked on in astonishment but as she had been promised twenty louis_xviii she made no remark in a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a post boy and horse which were harnessed and put in the post chaise in a minute while the porter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and strap here is the passport said the postilion which way are we going young gentleman â to fontainebleau replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with an almost masculine voice what do you say said mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly i am giving them the slip said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars this woman to whom we have given twenty louis_xviii may betray us for forty we will soon alter our direction and the young girl jumped into the britzka which was admirably arranged for sleeping in without scarcely touching the step you are always right said the music teacher seating herself by the side of her friend a quarter of an hour afterwards the postilion having been put in the right road passed with a crack of his whip through the gateway of the barriã re saint martin ah said mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly breathing freely here we are out of paris â_yes my dear the abduction is an accomplished fact replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â_yes and without violence said mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly
â i shall bring that forward as an extenuating circumstance replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars these word were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling over the pavement of la villette mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars no longer had a daughter chapter 98 the bell and bottle tavern and now let us leave mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and her friend pursuing their way to brussels and return to poor m_andrea_cavalcanti so inopportunely interrupted in his rise to fortune notwithstanding his youth master m_andrea_cavalcanti was a very skilful and intelligent boy we have seen that on the first rumor which reached the salon he had gradually approached the door and crossing two or three room at last disappeared but we have forgotten to mention one circumstance which nevertheless ought not to be omitted in one of the room he crossed the trousseau of the bride elect was on exhibition there were caskets of diamonds cashmere shawls valenciennes lace english veils and in fact all the tempting thing the bare mention of which makes the heart of young girl bound with joy and which is called the corbeille 22 now in passing through this room m_andrea_cavalcanti proved himself not only to be clever and intelligent but also provident for he helped himself to the most valuable of the ornaments before him furnished with this plunder m_andrea_cavalcanti leaped with a lighter heart from the window intending to slip through the hand of the gendarmes tall and well proportioned as an ancient gladiator and muscular as a spartan he walked for a quarter of an hour without knowing where to direct his step actuated by the sole idea of getting away from the spot where if he lingered he knew that he would surely be taken
having passed through the rue du mont blanc guided by the instinct which leads thieves always to take the safest path he found himself at the end of the rue la fayette there he stopped breathless and panting he was quite alone on one side was the vast wilderness of the saint lazare on the other paris enshrouded in darkness am i to be captured he cried no not if i can use more activity than my enemies my safety is now a mere question of speed at this moment he saw a cab at the top of the faubourg poissonniã re the dull driver smoking his pipe was plodding along toward the limits of the faubourg saint denis where no doubt he ordinarily had his station ho friend said m_benedetto what do you want sir asked the driver is your horse tired â tired oh yes tired enoughâ he has done nothing the whole of this blessed day four wretched fares and twenty sous over making in all seven franc are all that i have earned and i ought to take ten to the owner â will you add these twenty franc to the seven you have â with pleasure sir twenty franc are not to be despised tell me what i am to do for this â a very easy thing if your horse isnâ tired â i tell you heâ ll go like the wind only tell me which way to drive â towards the louvres â ah i know the wayâ you get good sweetened rum over there â exactly so i merely wish to overtake one of my friend with whom i am going to hunt tomorrow at chapelle en serval
he should have waited for me here with a cabriolet till half past eleven it is twelve and tired of waiting he must have gone on â_it is likely â well will you try and overtake him â nothing i should like better â if you do not overtake him before we reach bourget you shall have twenty franc if not before louvres thirty â and if we do overtake him â forty said m_andrea_cavalcanti after a momentâ hesitation at the end of which he remembered that he might safely promise thatâ all right said the man hop in and weâ re off who o pla m_andrea_cavalcanti got into the cab which passed rapidly through the faubourg saint denis along the faubourg saint martin crossed the barrier and threaded its way through the interminable villette they never overtook the chimerical friend yet m_andrea_cavalcanti frequently inquired of people on foot whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed for a green cabriolet and bay horse and as there are a great many cabriolets to be seen on the road to the low countries and as nine tenths of them are green the inquiries increased at every step everyone had just seen it pass it was only five hundred two hundred one hundred step in advance at length they reached it but it was not the friend once the cab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two post horse ah said m_andrea_cavalcanti to himself if i only had that britzka those two good post horse and above all the passport that carries them on and he sighed deeply the calash contained mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars dâ armilly hurry hurry said m_andrea_cavalcanti we must overtake him soon and the poor horse resumed the desperate gallop it had kept up since leaving the barrier and arrived steaming at louvres
â certainly said m_andrea_cavalcanti i shall not overtake my friend but i shall kill your horse therefore i had better stop here are thirty franc i will sleep at the cheval rouge and will secure a place in the first coach good night friend and m_andrea_cavalcanti after placing six pieces of five franc each in the manâ hand leaped lightly on to the pathway the cabman joyfully pocketed the sum and turned back on his road to paris m_andrea_cavalcanti pretended to go towards the hotel of the cheval rouge but after leaning an instant against the door and hearing the last sound of the cab which was disappearing from view he went on his road and with a lusty stride soon traversed the space of two leagues then he rested he must be near chapelle en serval where he pretended to be going it was not fatigue that stayed m_andrea_cavalcanti here it was that he might form some resolution adopt some plan it would be impossible to make use of a diligence equally so to engage post horse to travel either way a passport was necessary it was still more impossible to remain in the department of the oise one of the most open and strictly guarded in france this was quite out of the question especially to a man like m_andrea_cavalcanti perfectly conversant with criminal matters he sat down by the side of the moat buried his face in his hand and reflected ten minute after he raised his head his resolution was made he threw some dust over the topcoat which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume and going to chapelle en serval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the place the host opened my
friend said m_andrea_cavalcanti i was coming from mortefontaine to senlis when my horse which is a troublesome creature stumbled and threw me i must reach compiã gne tonight or i shall cause deep anxiety to my family could you let me hire a horse of you an innkeeper has always a horse to let whether it be good or bad the host called the stable boy and ordered him to saddle le blanc then he awoke his son a child of seven year whom he ordered to ride before the gentleman and bring back the horse m_andrea_cavalcanti gave the innkeeper twenty franc and in taking them from his pocket dropped a visiting card this belonged to one of his friend at the cafã de paris so that the innkeeper picking it up after m_andrea_cavalcanti had left was convinced that he had let his horse to the count of maulã on 25 rue saint dominique that being the name and address on the card le blanc was not a fast animal but he kept up an easy steady pace in three hour and a half m_andrea_cavalcanti had traversed the nine leagues which separated him from compiã gne and four oâ clock struck as he reached the place where the coaches stop there is an excellent tavern at compiã gne well remembered by those who have ever been there
andrea who had often stayed there in his rides about paris recollected the bell and bottle inn he turned around saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp and having dismissed the child giving him all the small coin he had about him he began knocking at the door very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hour before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper a waiter opened the door my friend said m_andrea_cavalcanti i have been dining at saint jean aux bois and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight but like a fool i have lost my way and have been walking for the last four hour in the forest show me into one of those pretty little room which overlook the court and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of bordeaux the waiter had no suspicions m_andrea_cavalcanti spoke with perfect composure he had a cigar in his mouth and his hand in the pocket of his top coat his clothes were fashionably made his chin smooth his boots irreproachable he looked merely as if he had stayed out very late that was all while the waiter was preparing his room the hostess arose m_andrea_cavalcanti assumed his most charming smile and asked if he could have no which he had occupied on his last stay at compiã gne unfortunately no was engaged by a young man who was travelling with his sister
andrea appeared in despair but consoled himself when the hostess assured him that no prepared for him was situated precisely the same as no and while warming his foot and chatting about the last races at chantilly he waited until they announced his room to be ready m_andrea_cavalcanti had not spoken without cause of the pretty room looking out upon the court of the bell hotel which with its triple galleries like those of a theatre with the jessamine and clematis twining round the light columns forms one of the prettiest entrances to an inn that you can imagine the fowl was tender the wine old the fire clear and sparkling and m_andrea_cavalcanti was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though nothing had happened then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit man of twenty year of age even when they are torn with remorse now here we are obliged to own that m_andrea_cavalcanti ought to have felt remorse but that he did not this was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance of his security
before daybreak he would awake leave the inn after rigorously paying his bill and reaching the forest he would under pretence of making studies in painting test the hospitality of some peasants procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet casting off the lionâ skin to assume that of the woodman then with his hand covered with dirt his hair darkened by means of a leaden comb his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the recipe he intended by following the wooded districts to reach the nearest frontier walking by night and sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries and only entering inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time once past the frontier m_andrea_cavalcanti proposed making money of his diamonds and by uniting the proceeds to ten bank notes he always carried about with him in case of accident he would then find himself possessor of about 50 000 livres which he philosophically considered as no very deplorable condition after all moreover he reckoned much on the interest of the mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars to hush up the rumor of their own misadventures these were the reasons which added to the fatigue caused m_andrea_cavalcanti to sleep so soundly in order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters but contented himself with bolting the door and placing on the table an unclasped and long pointed knife whose temper he well knew and which was never absent from him about seven in the morning m_andrea_cavalcanti was awakened by a ray of sunlight which played warm and brilliant upon his face in all well organized brains the predominating ideaâ and there always is oneâ is sure to be the last thought before sleeping and the first upon waking in the morning
andrea had scarcely opened his eye when his predominating idea presented itself and whispered in his ear that he had slept too long he jumped out of bed and ran to the window a gendarme was crossing the court a gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world even to a man void of uneasiness but for one who has a timid conscience and with good cause too the yellow blue and white uniform is really very alarming why is that gendarme there asked m_andrea_cavalcanti of himself then all at once he replied with that logic which the reader has doubtless remarked in him there is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn instead of being astonished let me dress myself and the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two month of fashionable life he had led in paris now then said m_andrea_cavalcanti while dressing himself iâ ll wait till he leaves and then iâ ll slip away 50047m and saying this m_andrea_cavalcanti who had now put on his boots and cravat stole gently to the window and a second time lifted up the muslin curtain not only was the first gendarme still there but the young man now perceived a second yellow blue and white uniform at the foot of the staircase the only one by which he could descend while a third on horseback holding a musket in his fist was posted as a sentinel at the great street door which alone afforded the means of egress the appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter for a crowd of curious loungers was extended before him effectually blocking the entrance to the hotel theyâ re after me was andreaâ first thought diable
a pallor overspread the young manâ forehead and he looked around him with anxiety his room like all those on the same floor had but one outlet to the gallery in the sight of everybody i am lost was his second thought and indeed for a man in andreaâ situation an arrest meant the assizes trial and death death without mercy or delay for a moment he convulsively pressed his head within his hand and during that brief period he became nearly mad with terror but soon a ray of hope glimmered in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered his mind and a faint smile played upon his white lip and pallid cheeks he looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the chimney piece they were a pen ink and paper with forced composure he dipped the pen in the ink and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of paper i have no money to pay my bill but i am not a dishonest man i leave behind me as a pledge this pin worth ten time the amount i shall be excused for leaving at daybreak for i was ashamed he then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper this done instead of leaving the door fastened he drew back the bolts and even placed the door ajar as though he had left the room forgetting to close it and slipping into the chimney like a man accustomed to that kind of gymnastic exercise after replacing the chimney board which represented achilles with deidamia and effacing the very marks of his foot upon the ashes he commenced climbing the hollow tunnel which afforded him the only means of escape left
at this precise time the first gendarme m_andrea_cavalcanti had noticed walked upstairs preceded by the commissary of police and supported by the second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was himself reinforced by the one stationed at the door m_andrea_cavalcanti was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances at daybreak the telegraphs were set at work in all directions and almost immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost endeavors to arrest the murderer of m_caderousse compiã gne that royal residence and fortified town is well furnished with authorities gendarmes and commissaries of police they therefore began operations as soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived and the bell and bottle being the best known hotel in the town they had naturally directed their first inquiries there now besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the hã tel de ville which is next door to the bell and bottle it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night the sentinel who was relieved at six oâ clock in the morning remembered perfectly that just as he was taking his post a few minute past four a young man arrived on horseback with a little boy before him the young man having dismissed the boy and horse knocked at the door of the hotel which was opened and again closed after his entrance this late arrival had attracted much suspicion and the young man being no other than m_andrea_cavalcanti the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their step towards his room they found the door ajar â_oh oh said the brigadier who thoroughly understood the trick a bad sign to find the door open i would rather find it triply bolted
and indeed the little note and pin upon the table confirmed or rather corroborated the sad truth m_andrea_cavalcanti had fled we say corroborated because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single proof he glanced around looked in the bed shook the curtains opened the closets and finally stopped at the chimney m_andrea_cavalcanti had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his foot in the ashes but still it was an outlet and in this light was not to be passed over without serious investigation the brigadier sent for some sticks and straw and having filled the chimney with them set a light to it the fire crackled and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano but still no prisoner fell down as they expected the fact was that m_andrea_cavalcanti at war with society ever since his youth was quite as deep as a gendarme even though he were advanced to the rank of brigadier and quite prepared for the fire he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the chimney pots 50049m at one time he thought he was saved for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice to the two gendarmes he is not here but venturing to peep he perceived that the latter instead of retiring as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement were watching with increased attention it was now his turn to look about him the hã tel de ville a massive sixteenth century building was on his right anyone could descend from the openings in the tower and examine every corner of the roof below and m_andrea_cavalcanti expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at one of these openings
if once discovered he knew he would be lost for the roof afforded no chance of escape he therefore resolved to descend not through the same chimney by which he had come up but by a similar one conducting to another room he looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued and having reached it he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by anyone at the same minute one of the little window of the hã tel de ville was thrown open and the head of a gendarme appeared for an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the building then after a long sigh of disappointment the head disappeared the brigadier calm and dignified as the law he represented passed through the crowd without answering the thousand questions addressed to him and re entered the hotel well asked the two gendarmes well my boys said the brigadier the brigand must really have escaped early this morning but we will send to the villers coterets and noyon roads and search the forest when we shall catch him no doubt the honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie when a loud scream accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell resounded through the court of the hotel ah what is that cried the brigadier some traveller seems impatient said the host what number was it that rang â number â run waiter at this moment the screams and ringing were redoubled aha said the brigadier stopping the servant the person who is ringing appears to want something more than amwaiter we will attend upon him with a gendarme
who occupies number â the little fellow who arrived last night in a post chaise with his sister and who asked for an apartment with two bed the bell here rang for the third time with another shriek of anguish follow me mr commissary said the brigadier tread in my step â wait an instant said the host number has two staircases inside and outside â good said the brigadier i will take charge of the inside one are the carbines loaded â_yes brigadier â well you guard the exterior and if he attempts to fly fire upon him he must be a great criminal from what the telegraph says the brigadier followed by the commissary disappeared by the inside staircase accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting m_andrea_cavalcanti had excited in the crowd this is what had happened m_andrea_cavalcanti had very cleverly managed to descend two thirds of the chimney but then his foot slipped and notwithstanding his endeavors he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended it would have signified little had the room been empty but unfortunately it was occupied two ladies sleeping in one bed were awakened by the noise and fixing their eye upon the spot whence the sound proceeded they saw a man one of these ladies the fair one uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the house_of_peers while the other rushing to the bell rope rang with all her strength m_andrea_cavalcanti as we can see was surrounded by misfortune for pityâ sake he cried pale and bewildered without seeing whom he was addressing â for pityâ sake do not call assistance save me i will not harm you â m_andrea_cavalcanti the murderer cried one of the ladies mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars exclaimed m_andrea_cavalcanti stupefied
â help help cried mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars dâ armilly taking the bell from her companionâ hand and ringing it yet more violently save me i am pursued said m_andrea_cavalcanti clasping his hand for pity for mercyâ sake do not deliver me up â_it is too late they are coming said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars well conceal me somewhere you can say you were needlessly alarmed you can turn their suspicions and save my life 50053m the two ladies pressing closely to one another and drawing the bedclothes tightly around them remained silent to this supplicating voice repugnance and fear taking possession of their mind well be it so at length said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars return by the same road you came and we will say nothing about you unhappy wretch â here he is here he is cried a voice from the landing here he is i see him the brigadier had put his eye to the keyhole and had discovered m_andrea_cavalcanti in a posture of entreaty a violent blow from the butt end of the musket burst open the lock two more forced out the bolts and the broken door fell in m_andrea_cavalcanti ran to the other door leading to the gallery ready to rush out but he was stopped short and he stood with his body a little thrown back pale and with the useless knife in his clenched hand fly then cried mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars dâ armilly whose pity returned as her fears diminished fly â or kill yourself said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars in a tone which a vestal in the amphitheatre would have used when urging the victorious gladiator to finish his vanquished adversary m_andrea_cavalcanti shuddered and looked on the young girl with an expression which proved how little he understood such ferocious honor kill myself he cried throwing down his knife why should i do so â why
you said answered mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars that you would be condemned to die like the worst criminals 50055m bah said m_andrea_cavalcanti crossing his arm one has friend the brigadier advanced to him sword in hand come come said m_andrea_cavalcanti sheathe your sword my fine fellow there is no occasion to make such a fuss since i give myself up and he held out his hand to be manacled the two girl looked with horror upon this shameful metamorphosis the man of the world shaking off his covering and appearing as a galley slave m_andrea_cavalcanti turned towards them and with an impertinent smile asked have you any message for your father mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars for in all probability i shall return to paris mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars covered her face with her hand â_oh oh said m_andrea_cavalcanti you need not be ashamed even though you did post after me was i not nearly your husband 50056m and with this raillery m_andrea_cavalcanti went out leaving the two girl a prey to their own feelings of shame and to the comments of the crowd an hour after they stepped into their calash both dressed in feminine attire the gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight but they were forced when the door was open to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering voice mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars closed her eye but though she could not see she could hear and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage â_oh why is not the world a wilderness she exclaimed throwing herself into the arm of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars dâ armilly her eye sparkling with the same kind of rage which made nero wish that the roman world had but one neck that he might sever it at a single blow
the next day they stopped at the hã tel de flandre at brussels the same evening m_andrea_cavalcanti was incarcerated in the conciergerie chapter 99 the law we have seen how quietly mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars dâ armilly accomplished their transformation and flight the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs we will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy and follow the baroness who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her had gone to seek her usual adviser m_lucien_debray the baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which over a girl of eugã nieâ character could not fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of family union the mother to maintain her ascendancy over her daughter must never fail to be a model of wisdom and a type of perfection now madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars feared eugã nieâ sagacity and the influence of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars dâ armilly she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon m_lucien_debray an expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her motherâ amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary moreover she saw that mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars detested m_lucien_debray not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of man and whom diogenes designated as animals upon two legs without feathers
unfortunately in this world of ours each person views thing through a certain medium and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others and madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars therefore very much regretted that the marriage of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had not taken place not only because the match was good and likely to insure the happiness of her child but because it would also set her at liberty she ran therefore to m_lucien_debray who after having like the rest of paris witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it had retired in haste to his club where he was chatting with some friend upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for three fourths of that city known as the capital of the world at the precise time when madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars dressed in black and concealed in a long veil was ascending the stairs leading to debrayâ apartments notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the young man was not at home m_lucien_debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend who tried to persuade him that after the terrible scene which had just taken place he ought as a friend of the family to marry mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and her two millions m_lucien_debray did not defend himself very warmly for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found a resting place in his heart tea play and the conversation which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs lasted till one oâ clock in the morning
meanwhile madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars veiled and uneasy awaited the return of m_lucien_debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed m_lucien_debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eye of the poor woman at twenty minute to twelve madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars tired of waiting returned home woman of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes in one respect they seldom return home after twelve oâ clock the baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars used in leaving it she ran lightly upstairs and with an aching heart entered her apartment contiguous as we know to that of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars she was fearful of exciting any remark and believed firmly in her daughterâ innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof she listened at eugã nieâ door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in place madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening and had gone to bed and to sleep she called the maid and questioned her mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars said the maid retired to her apartment with mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars dâ armilly they then took tea together after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no longer since then the maid had been below and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars therefore went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the recent events
in proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light what she had taken for confusion was a tumult what she had regarded as something distressing was in reality a disgrace and then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor mercã_dã_s who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars she said to herself is lost and so are we the affair as it will be reported will cover us with shame for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound how fortunate that mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble and her glance was turned towards heaven where a mysterious providence disposes all thing and out of a fault nay even a vice sometimes produces a blessing and then her thoughts cleaving through space like a bird in the air rested on m_andrea_cavalcanti this m_andrea_cavalcanti was a wretch a robber an assassin and yet his manner showed the effects of a sort of education if not a complete one he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune supported by an honorable name how could she extricate herself from this labyrinth to whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation m_lucien_debray to whom she had run with the first instinct of a woman towards the man she loves and who yet betrays her m_lucien_debray could but give her advice she must apply to someone more powerful than he the baroness then thought of m_noirtier_de_villefort it was m_noirtier_de_villefort who had remorselessly brought misfortune into her family as though they had been strangers
but no on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son in law and since m_noirtier_de_villefort the friend of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had acted in this way no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of andreaâ intrigues villefortâ conduct therefore upon reflection appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage but the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there she would see him the next day and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate she would at least obtain all the indulgence he could allow she would invoke the past recall old recollections she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty yet happy day m_noirtier_de_villefort would stifle the affair he had only to turn his eye on one side and allow m_andrea_cavalcanti to fly and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court and after this reasoning she slept easily at nine oâ clock next morning she arose and without ringing for her maid or giving the least sign of her activity she dressed herself in the same simple style as on the previous night then running downstairs she left the hotel walked to the rue de provence called a cab and drove to de villefortâ house_of_peers for the last month this wretched house_of_peers had presented the gloomy appearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague
some of the apartments were closed within and without the shutters were only opened to admit a minuteâ air showing the scared face of a footman and immediately afterwards the window would be closed like a gravestone falling on a sepulchre and the neighbors would say to each other in a low voice will there be another funeral today at the procureurâ house_of_peers madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion descending from the cab she approached the door with trembling knees and rang the bell three time did the bell ring with a dull heavy sound seeming to participate in the general sadness before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door which he opened just wide enough to allow his word to be heard he saw a lady a fashionable elegantly dressed lady and yet the door remained almost closed do you intend opening the door said the baroness first madame who are you â who am i you know me well enough â we no longer know anyone madame â you must be mad my friend said the baroness where do you come from â_oh this is too much â madame these are my order excuse me your name â the baroness mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars you have seen me twenty time â possibly madame and now what do you want â_oh how extraordinary i shall complain to m_noirtier_de_villefort of the impertinence of his servant â madame this is precaution not impertinence no one enters here without an order from dâ avrigny or without speaking to the procureur â well i have business with the procureur â is it pressing business â you can imagine so since i have not even brought my carriage out yet
but enough of thisâ here is my card take it to your master â madame will await my return â_yes go the concierge closed the door leaving madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars in the street she had not long to wait directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her and when she had passed through it was again shut without losing sight of her for an instant the concierge took a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court and blew it the valet de chambre appeared on the door step you will excuse this poor fellow madame he said as he preceded the baroness but his order are precise and m_noirtier_de_villefort begged me to tell you that he could not act otherwise in the court showing his merchandise was a tradesman who had been admitted with the same precautions the baroness ascended the step she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own and still guided by the valet de chambre who never lost sight of her for an instant she was introduced to the magistrateâ study preoccupied as madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it but m_noirtier_de_villefort raising his head bowed down by grief looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her lip forgive my servant he said for a terror i cannot blame them for from being suspected they have become suspicious madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate alluded but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never have believed that the sentiment had been carried so far
â you too then are unhappy she said â_yes madame replied the magistrate then you pity me â sincerely madame â and you understand what brings me here â you wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened â_yes sir a fearful misfortune â you mean a mischance â a mischance repeated the baroness alas madame said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of manner i consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable â and do you suppose this will be forgotten â everything will be forgotten madame said m_noirtier_de_villefort your daughter will be married tomorrow if not todayâ in a week if not tomorrow and i do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars gazed on m_noirtier_de_villefort stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm am i come to a friend she asked in a tone full of mournful dignity you know that you are madame said m_noirtier_de_villefort whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance and truly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now occupying the baroness and him well then be more affectionate my dear m_noirtier_de_villefort said the baroness speak to me not as a magistrate but as a friend and when i am in bitter anguish of spirit do not tell me that i ought to be gay m_noirtier_de_villefort bowed when i hear misfortunes named madame he said i have within the last few month contracted the bad habit of thinking of my own and then i cannot help drawing up an egotistical parallel in my mind that is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes yours appear to me mere mischances that is why my dreadful position makes yours appear enviable but this annoys you let us change the subject
you were saying madameâ â i came to ask you my friend said the baroness what will be done with this impostor â impostor repeated m_noirtier_de_villefort certainly madame you appear to extenuate some cases and exaggerate others impostor indeed m_andrea_cavalcanti or rather m_benedetto is nothing more nor less than an assassin â sir i do not deny the justice of your correction but the more severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man the more deeply will you strike our family come forget him for a moment and instead of pursuing him let him go â you are too late madame the order are issued â well should he be arrestedâ do they think they will arrest him â i hope so â if they should arrest him i know that sometimes prisons afford means of escape will you leave him in prison the procureur shook his head at least keep him there till my daughter be married â impossible madame justice has its formalities â what even for me said the baroness half jesting half in earnest for all even for myself among the rest replied m_noirtier_de_villefort 50063 â ah exclaimed the baroness without expressing the idea which the exclamation betrayed m_noirtier_de_villefort looked at her with that piercing glance which reads the secrets of the heart â_yes i know what you mean he said you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the world that the death which have kept me in mourning for the last three month and from which mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort has only escaped by a miracle have not happened by natural means â i was not thinking of that replied madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars quickly â_yes you were thinking of it and with justice
you could not help thinking of it and saying to yourself you who pursue crime so vindictively answer now why are there unpunished crimes in your dwelling â the baroness became pale you were saying this were you not â well i own it â i will answer you m_noirtier_de_villefort drew his armchair nearer to madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars then resting both hand upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual there are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty but when the culprits are discoveredâ m_noirtier_de_villefort here extended his hand toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his desk â when they are discovered i swear to you by all i hold most sacred that whoever they may be they shall die now after the oath i have just taken and which i will keep madame dare you ask for mercy for that wretch â but sir are you sure he is as guilty as they say â listen this is his description m_benedetto condemned at the age of sixteen for five year to the galleys for forgery he promised well as you seeâ first a runaway then an assassin â and who is this wretch â who can tell a vagabond a corsican â has no one owned him â no one his parents are unknown â but who was the man who brought him from lucca â another rascal like himself perhaps his accomplice the baroness clasped her hand m_noirtier_de_villefort she exclaimed in her softest and most captivating manner for heavenâ sake madame said m_noirtier_de_villefort with a firmness of expression not altogether free from harshnessâ for heavenâ sake do not ask pardon of me for a guilty wretch what am i the law has the law any eye to witness your grief
has the law ears to be melted by your sweet voice has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall no madame the law has commanded and when it commands it strikes you will tell me that i am a living being and not a codeâ a man and not a volume look at me madameâ look around me has mankind treated me as a brother have man loved me have they spared me has anyone shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my hand no madame they struck me always struck me 50065m woman siren that you are do you persist in fixing on me that fascinating eye which reminds me that i ought to blush well be it so let me blush for the faults you know and perhapsâ perhaps for even more than those but having sinned myself â_it may be more deeply than others i never rest till i have torn the disguises from my fellow creatures and found out their weaknesses i have always found them and more i repeat it with joy with triumph i have always found some proof of human perversity or error every criminal i condemn seems to me living evidence that i am not a hideous exception to the rest alas alas alas all the world is wicked let us therefore strike at wickedness m_noirtier_de_villefort pronounced these last word with a feverish rage which gave a ferocious eloquence to his word butâ said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars resolving to make a last effort this young man though a murderer is an orphan abandoned by everybody â so much the worse or rather so much the better it has been so ordained that he may have none to weep his fate â but
this is trampling on the weak sir â the weakness of a murderer â his dishonor reflects upon us â is not death in my house_of_peers â_oh sir exclaimed the baroness you are without pity for others well then i tell you they will have no mercy on you â be it so said m_noirtier_de_villefort raising his arm to heaven with a threatening gesture at least delay the trial till the next assizes we shall then have six month before us â no madame said m_noirtier_de_villefort instructions have been given there are yet five day left five day are more than i require do you not think that i also long for forgetfulness while working night and day i sometimes lose all recollection of the past and then i experience the same sort of happiness i can imagine the dead feel still it is better than suffering â but sir he has fled let him escapeâ inaction is a pardonable offence â i tell you it is too late early this morning the telegraph was employed and at this very minuteâ â sir said the valet de chambre entering the room a dragoon has brought this despatch from the minister of the interior m_noirtier_de_villefort seized the letter and hastily broke the seal madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars trembled with fear m_noirtier_de_villefort started with joy arrested he exclaimed he was taken at compiã gne and all is over madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars rose from her seat pale and cold adieu sir she said adieu madame replied the kingâ attorney as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the door then turning to his desk he said striking the letter with the back of his right hand come i had a forgery three robberies and two cases of arson i only wanted a murder and here it is
it will be a splendid session chapter 100 the apparition as the procureur had told madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort was not yet recovered bowed down with fatigue she was indeed confined to her bed and it was in her own room and from the lip of madame m_noirtier_de_villefort that she heard all the strange events we have related we mean the flight of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and the arrest of m_andrea_cavalcanti or rather m_benedetto together with the accusation of murder pronounced against him but mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of health indeed her brain was only the seat of vague idea and confused forms mingled with strange fancies alone presented themselves before her eye during the daytime valentineâ perceptions remained tolerably clear owing to the constant presence of m_noirtier_de_villefort who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughterâ room and watched her with his paternal tenderness m_noirtier_de_villefort also on his return from the law courts frequently passed an hour or two with his father and child at six oâ clock m_noirtier_de_villefort retired to his study at eight dâ avrigny himself arrived bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl and then m_noirtier_de_villefort was carried away a nurse of the doctorâ choice succeeded them and never left till about ten or eleven oâ clock when mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort was asleep as she went downstairs she gave the keys of valentineâ room to m_noirtier_de_villefort so that no one could reach the sick room excepting through that of madame m_noirtier_de_villefort and little edward every morning m_maximilian_morrel called on m_noirtier_de_villefort to receive news of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and extraordinary as it seemed each day found him less uneasy
certainly though mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort still labored under dreadful nervous excitement she was better and moreover count_of_monte_cristo had told him when half distracted he had rushed to the countâ house_of_peers that if she were not dead in two hour she would be saved now four day had elapsed and mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort still lived the nervous excitement of which we speak pursued mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort even in her sleep or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking hour it was then in the silence of night in the dim light shed from the alabaster lamp on the chimney piece that she saw the shadows pass and repass which hover over the bed of sickness and fan the fever with their trembling wings first she fancied she saw her stepmother threatening her then m_maximilian_morrel stretched his arm towards her sometimes mere strangers like the count_of_monte_cristo came to visit her even the very furniture in these moment of delirium seemed to move and this state lasted till about three oâ clock in the morning when a deep heavy slumber overcame the young girl from which she did not awake till daylight on the evening of the day on which mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort had learned of the flight of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and the arrest of m_benedetto m_noirtier_de_villefort having retired as well as m_noirtier_de_villefort and dâ avrigny her thoughts wandered in a confused maze alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had just heard eleven oâ clock had struck the nurse having placed the beverage prepared by the doctor within reach of the patient and locked the door was listening with terror to the comments of the servant in the kitchen and storing her memory with all the horrible stories which had for some month past amused the occupants of the antechambers in the house_of_peers of the kingâ attorney
meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefully locked ten minute had elapsed since the nurse had left mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort who for the last hour had been suffering from the fever which returned nightly incapable of controlling her idea was forced to yield to the excitement which exhausted itself in producing and reproducing a succession and recurrence of the same fancies and images the night lamp threw out countless rays each resolving itself into some strange form to her disordered imagination when suddenly by its flickering light mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort thought she saw the door of her library which was in the recess by the chimney piece open slowly though she in vain listened for the sound of the hinges on which it turned at any other time mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort would have seized the silken bell pull and summoned assistance but nothing astonished her in her present situation her reason told her that all the visions she beheld were but the child of her imagination and the conviction was strengthened by the fact that in the morning no traces remained of the nocturnal phantoms who disappeared with the coming of daylight from behind the door a human figure appeared but the girl was too familiar with such apparitions to be alarmed and therefore only stared hoping to recognize m_maximilian_morrel the figure advanced towards the bed and appeared to listen with profound attention at this moment a ray of light glanced across the face of the midnight visitor â_it is not he she murmured and waited in the assurance that this was but a dream for the man to disappear or assume some other form
still she felt her pulse and finding it throb violently she remembered that the best method of dispelling such illusions was to drink for a draught of the beverage prepared by the doctor to allay her fever seemed to cause a reaction of the brain and for a short time she suffered less mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort therefore reached her hand towards the glass but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed the apparition advanced more quickly towards her and approached the young girl so closely that she fancied she heard his breath and felt the pressure of his hand this time the illusion or rather the reality surpassed anything mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort had before experienced she began to believe herself really alive and awake and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her shudder the pressure she felt was evidently intended to arrest her arm and she slowly withdrew it then the figure from whom she could not detach her eye and who appeared more protecting than menacing took the glass and walking towards the night light held it up as if to test its transparency this did not seem sufficient the man or rather the ghostâ for he trod so softly that no sound was heardâ then poured out about a spoonful into the glass and drank it mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupefaction every minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another vision but the man instead of dissolving like a shadow again approached her and said in an agitated voice now you may drink mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort shuddered it was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in a living voice and she was about to utter an exclamation the man placed his finger on her lip
â the count_of_monte_cristo she murmured it was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girlâ mind as to the reality of the scene her eye started with terror her hand trembled and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her still the presence of count_of_monte_cristo at such an hour his mysterious fanciful and extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall might well seem impossibilities to her shattered reason do not call anyoneâ do not be alarmed said the count do not let a shade of suspicion or uneasiness remain in your breast the man standing before you mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort for this time it is no ghost is nothing more than the tenderest father and the most respectful friend you could dream of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort could not reply the voice which indicated the real presence of a being in the room alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a syllable still the expression of her eye seemed to inquire if your intentions are pure why are you here the countâ marvellous sagacity understood all that was passing in the young girlâ mind listen to me he said or rather look upon me look at my face paler even than usual and my eye red with wearinessâ for four day i have not closed them for i have been constantly watching you to protect and preserve you for m_maximilian_morrel the blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort for the name just announced by the count dispelled all the fear with which his presence had inspired her m_maximilian_morrel she exclaimed and so sweet did the sound appear to her that she repeated itâ m_maximilian_morrel has he then owned all to you â everything
he told me your life was his and i have promised him that you shall live â you have promised him that i shall live â_yes â but sir you spoke of vigilance and protection are you a doctor â_yes the best you could have at the present time believe me â but you say you have watched said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort uneasily where have you been i have not seen you the count extended his hand towards the library i was hidden behind that door he said which leads into the next house_of_peers which i have rented mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort turned her eye away and with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear exclaimed sir i think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion and that what you call protection is more like an insult â mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort he answered during my long watch over you all i have observed has been what people visited you what nourishment was prepared and what beverage was served then when the latter appeared dangerous to me i entered as i have now done and substituted in the place of the poison a healthful draught which instead of producing the death intended caused life to circulate in your veins â poisonâ death exclaimed mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort half believing herself under the influence of some feverish hallucination what are you saying sir 50071 â hush my child said count_of_monte_cristo again placing his finger upon her lip i did say poison and death but drink some of this and the count took a bottle from his pocket containing a red liquid of which he poured a few drops into the glass drink this and then take nothing more tonight mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort stretched out her hand but scarcely had she touched the glass when she drew back in fear
monte cristo took the glass drank half its contents and then presented it to mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort who smiled and swallowed the rest â_oh yes she exclaimed i recognize the flavor of my nocturnal beverage which refreshed me so much and seemed to ease my aching brain thank you sir thank you â this is how you have lived during the last four night mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said the count but oh how i passed that time oh the wretched hour i have enduredâ the torture to which i have submitted when i saw the deadly poison poured into your glass and how i trembled lest you should drink it before i could find time to throw it away â sir said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort at the height of her terror you say you endured tortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass but if you saw this you must also have seen the person who poured it â_yes mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort raised herself in bed and drew over her chest which appeared whiter than snow the embroidered cambric still moist with the cold dews of delirium to which were now added those of terror you saw the person repeated the young girl â_yes repeated the count what you tell me is horrible sir you wish to make me believe something too dreadful what attempt to murder me in my fatherâ house_of_peers in my room on my bed of sickness oh leave me sir you are tempting meâ you make me doubt the goodness of providenceâ it is impossible it cannot be â are you the first that this hand has stricken have you not seen de madame_de_saint_mã_ran madame_de_saint_mã_ran barrois all fall
would not m_noirtier_de_villefort also have fallen a victim had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three year neutralized the effects of the poison â_oh heaven said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last month â and have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor like that of dried orange peel â_oh yes yes â then that explains all said count_of_monte_cristo your grandfather knows then that a poisoner life here perhaps he even suspects the person he has been fortifying you his beloved child against the fatal effects of the poison which has failed because your system was already impregnated with it but even this would have availed little against a more deadly medium of death employed four day ago which is generally but too fatal â but who then is this assassin this murderer â let me also ask you a question have you never seen anyone enter your room at night â_oh yes i have frequently seen shadows pass close to me approach and disappear but i took them for visions raised by my feverish imagination and indeed when you entered i thought i was under the influence of delirium â then you do not know who it is that attempts your life 50073m no said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort who could desire my death â you shall know it now then said count_of_monte_cristo listening how do you mean said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort looking anxiously around because you are not feverish or delirious tonight but thoroughly awake midnight is striking which is the hour murderers choose â_oh heavens exclaimed mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort wiping off the drops which ran down her forehead midnight struck slowly and sadly every hour seemed to strike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor girl
â mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said the count summon up all your courage still the beatings of your heart do not let a sound escape you and feign to be asleep then you will see mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort seized the countâ hand i think i hear a noise she said leave me â good bye for the present replied the count walking upon tiptoe towards the library door and smiling with an expression so sad and paternal that the young girlâ heart was filled with gratitude before closing the door he turned around once more and said not a movementâ not a word let them think you asleep or perhaps you may be killed before i have the power of helping you and with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the door which noiselessly closed after him chapter 101 locusta mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort was alone two other clocks slower than that of saint philippe du roule struck the hour of midnight from different directions and excepting the rumbling of a few carriage all was silent then valentineâ attention was engrossed by the clock in her room which marked the seconds she began counting them remarking that they were much slower than the beatings of her heart and still she doubted the inoffensive mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort could not imagine that anyone should desire her death why should they to what end what had she done to excite the malice of an enemy there was no fear of her falling asleep one terrible idea pressed upon her mind that someone existed in the world who had attempted to assassinate her and who was about to endeavor to do so again
supposing this person wearied at the inefficacy of the poison should as count_of_monte_cristo intimated have recourse to steel what if the count should have no time to run to her rescue what if her last moment were approaching and she should never again see m_maximilian_morrel when this terrible chain of idea presented itself mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort was nearly persuaded to ring the bell and call for help but through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the countâ that eye which lived in her memory and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted friendship twenty minute twenty tedious minute passed thus then ten more and at last the clock struck the half hour just then the sound of finger nails slightly grating against the door of the library informed mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort that the count was still watching and recommended her to do the same at the same time on the opposite side that is towards edwardâ room mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort fancied that she heard the creaking of the floor she listened attentively holding her breath till she was nearly suffocated the lock turned and the door slowly opened mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort had raised herself upon her elbow and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eye with her arm then trembling agitated and her heart beating with indescribable terror she awaited the event someone approached the bed and drew back the curtains mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort summoned every effort and breathed with that regular respiration which announces tranquil sleep mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said a low voice the girl shuddered to the heart but did not reply mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort repeated the same voice still silent mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort had promised not to wake
then everything was still excepting that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort heard the almost noiseless sound of some liquid being poured into the glass she had just emptied then she ventured to open her eyelids and glance over her extended arm she saw a woman in a white dressing gown pouring a liquor from a phial into her glass during this short time mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort must have held her breath or moved in some slight degree for the woman disturbed stopped and leaned over the bed in order the better to ascertain whether mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort slept it was madame m_noirtier_de_villefort on recognizing her step mother mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort could not repress a shudder which caused a vibration in the bed madame m_noirtier_de_villefort instantly stepped back close to the wall and there shaded by the bed curtains she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort the latter recollected the terrible caution of count_of_monte_cristo she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp knife then collecting all her remaining strength she forced herself to close her eye but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame generally so easy to accomplish became almost impossible at this moment so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the truth madame m_noirtier_de_villefort however reassured by the silence which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort again extended her hand and half hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the glass then she retired so gently that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort did not know she had left the room she only witnessed the withdrawal of the armâ the fair round arm of a woman but twenty five year old and who yet spread death around her 50077m
it is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort during the minute and a half madame m_noirtier_de_villefort remained in the room the grating against the library door aroused the young girl from the stupor in which she was plunged and which almost amounted to insensibility she raised her head with an effort the noiseless door again turned on its hinges and the count_of_monte_cristo reappeared well said he do you still doubt â_oh murmured the young girl have you seen â alas â did you recognize mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort groaned â_oh yes she said i saw but i cannot believe â would you rather die then and cause maximilianâ death â_oh repeated the young girl almost bewildered can i not leave the house_of_peers can i not escape â mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort the hand which now threatens you will pursue you everywhere your servant will be seduced with gold and death will be offered to you disguised in every shape you will find it in the water you drink from the spring in the fruit you pluck from the tree â but did you not say that my kind grandfatherâ precaution had neutralized the poison â_yes but not against a strong dose the poison will be changed and the quantity increased he took the glass and raised it to his lip â_it is already done he said brucine is no longer employed but a simple narcotic i can recognize the flavor of the alcohol in which it has been dissolved if you had taken what madame m_noirtier_de_villefort has poured into your glass valentineâ valentineâ you would have been doomed â but exclaimed the young girl why am i thus pursued â why are you so kindâ so goodâ so unsuspicious of ill that you cannot understand mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â no i have never injured her â but
you are rich mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort you have 200 000 livres a year and you prevent her son from enjoying these 200 000 livres â how so the fortune is not her gift but is inherited from my relations â certainly and that is why and madame_de_saint_mã_ran have died that is why m_noirtier_de_villefort was sentenced the day he made you his heir that is why you in your turn are to dieâ it is because your father would inherit your property and your brother his only son succeed to his â edward poor child are all these crimes committed on his account â ah then you at length understand â heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him â mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort you are an angel â but why is my grandfather allowed to live â_it was considered that you dead the fortune would naturally revert to your brother unless he were disinherited and besides the crime appearing useless it would be folly to commit it â and is it possible that this frightful combination of crimes has been invented by a woman â do you recollect in the arbor of the hã tel des postes at perugia seeing a man in a brown cloak whom your stepmother was questioning upon aqua tofana well ever since then the infernal project has been ripening in her brain â ah then indeed sir said the sweet girl bathed in tears i see that i am condemned to die â no mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort for i have foreseen all their plots no your enemy is conquered since we know her and you will live valentineâ live to be happy yourself and to confer happiness upon a noble heart but to insure this you must rely on me â command me sirâ what am i to do â you
must blindly take what i give you â alas were it only for my own sake i should prefer to die â you must not confide in anyoneâ not even in your father â my father is not engaged in this fearful plot is he sir asked mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort clasping her hand no and yet your father a man accustomed to judicial accusations ought to have known that all these death have not happened naturally it is he who should have watched over youâ he should have occupied my placeâ he should have emptied that glassâ he should have risen against the assassin spectre against spectre he murmured in a low voice as he concluded his sentence sir said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort i will do all i can to live for there are two beings who love me and will die if i dieâ my grandfather and m_maximilian_morrel â i will watch over them as i have over you â well sir do as you will with me and then she added in a low voice â_oh heavens what will befall me â whatever may happen mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort do not be alarmed though you suffer though you lose sight hearing consciousness fear nothing though you should awake and be ignorant where you are still do not fear even though you should find yourself in a sepulchral vault or coffin reassure yourself then and say to yourself at this moment a friend a father who life for my happiness and that of m_maximilian_morrel watches over me â alas alas what a fearful extremity â mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort would you rather denounce your stepmother â i would rather die a hundred timesâ oh yes die â no you will not die but will you promise me whatever happens that you will not complain but hope â i will think of m_maximilian_morrel â you are my own darling child mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort
i alone can save you and i will mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort in the extremity of her terror joined her hand for she felt that the moment had arrived to ask for courage and began to pray and while uttering little more than incoherent word she forgot that her white shoulders had no other covering than her long hair and that the pulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her nightdress count_of_monte_cristo gently laid his hand on the young girlâ arm drew the velvet coverlet close to her throat and said with a paternal smile my child believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the goodness of providence and the love of m_maximilian_morrel mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort gave him a look full of gratitude and remained as docile as a child then he drew from his waistcoat pocket the little emerald box raised the golden lid and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea which he placed in her hand she took it and looked attentively on the count there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector which commanded her veneration she evidently interrogated him by her look â_yes said he mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort carried the pastille to her mouth and swallowed it and now my dear child adieu for the present i will try and gain a little sleep for you are saved â go said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort whatever happens i promise you not to fear count_of_monte_cristo for some time kept his eye fixed on the young girl who gradually fell asleep yielding to the effects of the narcotic the count had given her
then he took the glass emptied three part of the contents in the fireplace that it might be supposed mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort had taken it and replaced it on the table then he disappeared after throwing a farewell glance on mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort who slept with the confidence and innocence of an angel at the foot of the lord chapter 102 mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort the night light continued to burn on the chimney piece exhausting the last drops of oil which floated on the surface of the water the globe of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue and the flame brightening before it expired threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate object have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human creature in its final agonies a dull and dismal light was shed over the bedclothes and curtains surrounding the young girl all noise in the streets had ceased and the silence was frightful it was then that the door of edwardâ room opened and a head we have before noticed appeared in the glass opposite it was madame m_noirtier_de_villefort who came to witness the effects of the drink she had prepared she stopped in the doorway listened for a moment to the flickering of the lamp the only sound in that deserted room and then advanced to the table to see if valentineâ glass were empty it was still about a quarter full as we before stated madame m_noirtier_de_villefort emptied the contents into the ashes which she disturbed that they might the more readily absorb the liquid then she carefully rinsed the glass and wiping it with her handkerchief replaced it on the table
if anyone could have looked into the room just then he would have noticed the hesitation with which madame m_noirtier_de_villefort approached the bed and looked fixedly on mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort the dim light the profound silence and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour and still more by her own conscience all combined to produce a sensation of fear the poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own work at length she rallied drew aside the curtain and leaning over the pillow gazed intently on mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort the young girl no longer breathed no breath issued through the half closed teeth the white lip no longer quiveredâ the eye were suffused with a bluish vapor and the long black lashes rested on a cheek white as wax madame m_noirtier_de_villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girlâ heart it was cold and motionless she only felt the pulsation in her own fingers and withdrew her hand with a shudder one arm was hanging out of the bed from shoulder to elbow it was moulded after the arm of germain pillonâ â graces 23 but the fore arm seemed to be slightly distorted by convulsion and the hand so delicately formed was resting with stiff outstretched fingers on the framework of the bed the nails too were turning blue madame m_noirtier_de_villefort had no longer any doubt all was overâ she had consummated the last terrible work she had to accomplish
there was no more to do in the room so the poisoner retired stealthily as though fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps but as she withdrew she still held aside the curtain absorbed in the irresistible attraction always exerted by the picture of death so long as it is merely mysterious and does not excite disgust the minute passed madame m_noirtier_de_villefort could not drop the curtain which she held like a funeral pall over the head of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort she was lost in reverie and the reverie of crime is remorse just then the lamp again flickered the noise startled madame m_noirtier_de_villefort who shuddered and dropped the curtain immediately afterwards the light expired and the room was plunged in frightful obscurity while the clock at that minute struck half past four overpowered with agitation the poisoner succeeded in groping her way to the door and reached her room in an agony of fear the darkness lasted two hour longer then by degrees a cold light crept through the venetian blinds until at length it revealed the objects in the room about this time the nurseâ cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with a cup in her hand to the tender eye of a father or a lover the first glance would have sufficed to reveal valentineâ condition but to this hireling mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort only appeared to sleep good she exclaimed approaching the table she has taken part of her draught the glass is three quarters empty then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire and although she had just left her bed she could not resist the temptation offered by valentineâ sleep so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a little more rest the clock striking eight awoke her
astonished at the prolonged slumber of the patient and frightened to see that the arm was still hanging out of the bed she advanced towards mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and for the first time noticed the white lip she tried to replace the arm but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sick nurse she screamed aloud then running to the door exclaimed help help 50083m what is the matter asked dâ avrigny at the foot of the stairs it being the hour he usually visited her what is it asked m_noirtier_de_villefort rushing from his room doctor do you hear them call for help â_yes yes let us hasten up it was in valentineâ room but before the doctor and the father could reach the room the servant who were on the same floor had entered and seeing mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort pale and motionless on her bed they lifted up their hand towards heaven and stood transfixed as though struck by lightening call madame m_noirtier_de_villefort wake madame m_noirtier_de_villefort cried the procureur from the door of his chamber which apparently he scarcely dared to leave but instead of obeying him the servant stood watching dâ avrigny who ran to mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and raised her in his arm what this one too he exclaimed â_oh where will be the end m_noirtier_de_villefort rushed into the room what are you saying doctor he exclaimed raising his hand to heaven i say that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort is dead replied dâ avrigny in a voice terrible in its solemn calmness 50085m m_noirtier_de_villefort staggered and buried his head in the bed
on the exclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father the servant all fled with muttered imprecations they were heard running down the stairs and through the long passages then there was a rush in the court afterwards all was still they had one and all deserted the accursed house_of_peers just then madame m_noirtier_de_villefort in the act of slipping on her dressing gown threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless as though interrogating the occupants of the room while she endeavored to call up some rebellious tears on a sudden she stepped or rather bounded with outstretched arm towards the table she saw dâ avrigny curiously examining the glass which she felt certain of having emptied during the night it was now a third full just as it was when she threw the contents into the ashes the spectre of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort rising before the poisoner would have alarmed her less it was indeed the same color as the draught she had poured into the glass and which mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort had drunk it was indeed the poison which could not deceive dâ avrigny which he now examined so closely it was doubtless a miracle from heaven that notwithstanding her precautions there should be some trace some proof remaining to reveal the crime while madame m_noirtier_de_villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of terror and m_noirtier_de_villefort with his head hidden in the bedclothes saw nothing around him dâ avrigny approached the window that he might the better examine the contents of the glass and dipping the tip of his finger in tasted it ah he exclaimed â_it is no longer brucine that is used let me see what it is
then he ran to one of the cupboards in valentineâ room which had been transformed into a medicine closet and taking from its silver case a small bottle of nitric acid dropped a little of it into the liquor which immediately changed to a blood red color ah exclaimed dâ avrigny in a voice in which the horror of a judge unveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of a student making a discovery madame m_noirtier_de_villefort was overpowered her eye first flashed and then swam she staggered towards the door and disappeared directly afterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground was heard but no one paid any attention to it the nurse was engaged in watching the chemical analysis and m_noirtier_de_villefort was still absorbed in grief dâ avrigny alone had followed madame m_noirtier_de_villefort with his eye and watched her hurried retreat he lifted up the drapery over the entrance to edwardâ room and his eye reaching as far as madame de villefortâ apartment he beheld her extended lifeless on the floor go to the assistance of madame m_noirtier_de_villefort he said to the nurse madame m_noirtier_de_villefort is ill 50087m but mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars de villefortâ â stammered the nurse mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort no longer requires help said dâ avrigny since she is dead â dead dead groaned forth m_noirtier_de_villefort in a paroxysm of grief which was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron heart of that man dead repeated a third voice who said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort was dead the two man turned round and saw m_maximilian_morrel standing at the door pale and terror stricken this is what had happened at the usual time m_maximilian_morrel had presented himself at the little door leading to noirtierâ room
contrary to custom the door was open and having no occasion to ring he entered he waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to conduct him to m_noirtier_de_villefort but no one answered the servant having as we know deserted the house_of_peers m_maximilian_morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness count_of_monte_cristo had promised him that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort should live and so far he had always fulfilled his word every night the count had given him news which was the next morning confirmed by m_noirtier_de_villefort still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him and he called a second and third time still no answer then he determined to go up noirtierâ room was opened like all the rest the first thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual place but his eye expressed alarm which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread his features how are you sir asked m_maximilian_morrel with a sickness of heart well answered the old man by closing his eye but his appearance manifested increasing uneasiness you are thoughtful sir continued m_maximilian_morrel you want something shall i call one of the servant â_yes replied m_noirtier_de_villefort m_maximilian_morrel pulled the bell but though he nearly broke the cord no one answered he turned towards m_noirtier_de_villefort the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance momentarily increased â_oh exclaimed m_maximilian_morrel why do they not come is anyone ill in the house_of_peers the eye of m_noirtier_de_villefort seemed as though they would start from their sockets what is the matter you alarm me mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort valentine â_yes yes signed m_noirtier_de_villefort m_maximilian_morrel tried to speak but he could articulate nothing he staggered and supported himself against the wainscot then he pointed to the door â_yes yes yes continued the old man 50089
m m_maximilian_morrel rushed up the little staircase while noirtierâ eye seemed to say â quicker quicker in a minute the young man darted through several room till at length he reached valentineâ there was no occasion to push the door it was wide open a sob was the only sound he heard he saw as though in a mist a black figure kneeling and buried in a confused mass of white drapery a terrible fear transfixed him it was then he heard a voice exclaim mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort is dead and another voice which like an echo repeated dead dead 50090m chapter 103 m_maximilian_morrel m_noirtier_de_villefort rose half ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief the terrible office he had held for twenty five year had succeeded in making him more or less than man his glance at first wandering fixed itself upon m_maximilian_morrel who are you sir he asked that forget that this is not the manner to enter a house_of_peers stricken with death go sir go but m_maximilian_morrel remained motionless he could not detach his eye from that disordered bed and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on it go do you hear said m_noirtier_de_villefort while dâ avrigny advanced to lead m_maximilian_morrel out m_maximilian_morrel stared for a moment at the corpse gazed all around the room then upon the two man he opened his mouth to speak but finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable idea that occupied his brain he went out thrusting his hand through his hair in such a manner that m_noirtier_de_villefort and dâ avrigny for a moment diverted from the engrossing topic exchanged glances which seemed to say â he is mad but in less than five minute the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight m_maximilian_morrel was seen carrying with superhuman strength the armchair containing m_noirtier_de_villefort upstairs
when he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into valentineâ room this could only have been accomplished by means of unnatural strength supplied by powerful excitement but the most fearful spectacle was m_noirtier_de_villefort being pushed towards the bed his face expressing all his meaning and his eye supplying the want of every other faculty that pale face and flaming glance appeared to m_noirtier_de_villefort like a frightful apparition each time he had been brought into contact with his father something terrible had happened see what they have done cried m_maximilian_morrel with one hand leaning on the back of the chair and the other extended towards mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort see my father see m_noirtier_de_villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man who almost a stranger to him called m_noirtier_de_villefort his father at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eye which became bloodshot the veins of the throat swelled his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with epilepsy nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry and the cry issued from his pores if we may thus speakâ a cry frightful in its silence dâ avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative sir cried m_maximilian_morrel seizing the moist hand of the paralytic they ask me who i am and what right i have to be here oh you know it tell them tell them and the young manâ voice was choked by sobs as for the old man his chest heaved with his panting respiration one could have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding death at length happier than the young man who sobbed without weeping tears glistened in the eye of m_noirtier_de_villefort
â tell them said m_maximilian_morrel in a hoarse voice tell them that i am her betrothed tell them she was my beloved my noble girl my only blessing in the world tell themâ oh tell them that corpse belongs to me the young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish fell heavily on his knees before the bed which his fingers grasped with convulsive energy dâ avrigny unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion turned away and m_noirtier_de_villefort without seeking any further explanation and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn extended his hand towards the young man but m_maximilian_morrel saw nothing he had grasped the hand of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the sheets for some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs exclamations and prayers at length m_noirtier_de_villefort the most composed of all spoke sir said he to m_maximilian_morrel you say you loved mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort that you were betrothed to her i knew nothing of this engagement of this love yet i her father forgive you for i see that your grief is real and deep and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place in my heart but you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earthâ she has nothing more to do with the adoration of man take a last farewell sir of her sad remains take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own and then separate yourself from her forever mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort now requires only the ministrations of the priest 50093
m you are mistaken sir exclaimed m_maximilian_morrel raising himself on one knee his heart pierced by a more acute pang than any he had yet feltâ you are mistaken mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort dying as she has not only requires a priest but an avenger you m_noirtier_de_villefort send for the priest i will be the avenger â what do you mean sir asked m_noirtier_de_villefort trembling at the new idea inspired by the delirium of m_maximilian_morrel i tell you sir that two person exist in you the father has mourned sufficiently now let the procureur fulfil his office the eye of m_noirtier_de_villefort glistened and dâ avrigny approached gentlemen said m_maximilian_morrel reading all that passed through the mind of the witnesses to the scene i know what i am saying and you know as well as i do what i am about to sayâ mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort has been assassinated m_noirtier_de_villefort hung his head dâ avrigny approached nearer and m_noirtier_de_villefort said yesâ with his eye now sir continued m_maximilian_morrel in these day no one can disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her disappearance even were she not a young beautiful and adorable creature like mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort now le procureur du roi said m_maximilian_morrel with increasing vehemence no mercy is allowed i denounce the crime it is your place to seek the assassin the young manâ implacable eye interrogated m_noirtier_de_villefort who on his side glanced from m_noirtier_de_villefort to dâ avrigny but instead of finding sympathy in the eye of the doctor and his father he only saw an expression as inflexible as that of m_maximilian_morrel â_yes indicated the old man assuredly said dâ avrigny sir said m_noirtier_de_villefort striving to struggle against this triple force and his own emotion â sir you are deceived no one commits crimes here i am stricken by fate
it is horrible indeed but no one assassinates the eye of m_noirtier_de_villefort lighted up with rage and dâ avrigny prepared to speak m_maximilian_morrel however extended his arm and commanded silence and i say that murders are committed here said m_maximilian_morrel whose voice though lower in tone lost none of its terrible distinctness i tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four month i tell you valentineâ life was attempted by poison four day ago though she escaped owing to the precautions of m_noirtier_de_villefort i tell you that the dose has been double the poison changed and that this time it has succeeded i tell you that you know these thing as well as i do since this gentleman has forewarned you both as a doctor and as a friend â_oh you rave sir exclaimed m_noirtier_de_villefort in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken 50095m i rave said m_maximilian_morrel well then i appeal to dâ avrigny himself ask him sir if he recollects the word he uttered in the garden of this house_of_peers on the night of madame de saint mã ranâ death you thought yourselves alone and talked about that tragical death and the fatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort m_noirtier_de_villefort and dâ avrigny exchanged look â_yes yes continued m_maximilian_morrel recall the scene for the word you thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears certainly after witnessing the culpable indolence manifested by m_noirtier_de_villefort towards his own relations i ought to have denounced him to the authorities then i should not have been an accomplice to thy death as i now am sweet beloved mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort but the accomplice shall become the avenger
this fourth murder is apparent to all and if thy father abandon thee mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort it is i and i swear it that shall pursue the assassin and this time as though nature had at least taken compassion on the vigorous frame nearly bursting with its own strength the word of m_maximilian_morrel were stifled in his throat his breast heaved the tears so long rebellious gushed from his eye and he threw himself weeping on his knees by the side of the bed then dâ avrigny spoke and i too he exclaimed in a low voice i unite with m_maximilian_morrel in demanding justice for crime my blood boils at the idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly concession â_oh merciful heavens murmured m_noirtier_de_villefort m_maximilian_morrel raised his head and reading the eye of the old man which gleamed with unnatural lustre â stay he said m_noirtier_de_villefort wishes to speak â_yes indicated m_noirtier_de_villefort with an expression the more terrible from all his faculties being centred in his glance do you know the assassin asked m_maximilian_morrel â_yes replied m_noirtier_de_villefort and will you direct us exclaimed the young man listen dâ avrigny listen m_noirtier_de_villefort looked upon m_maximilian_morrel with one of those melancholy smile which had so often made mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort happy and thus fixed his attention then having riveted the eye of his interlocutor on his own he glanced towards the door do you wish me to leave said m_maximilian_morrel sadly â_yes replied m_noirtier_de_villefort alas alas sir have pity on me the old manâ eye remained fixed on the door may i at least return asked m_maximilian_morrel â_yes â must i leave alone â no â whom am i to take with me the procureur â no â the doctor â_yes â you wish to remain alone with m_noirtier_de_villefort â_yes â but can he understand you â_yes â_oh
said m_noirtier_de_villefort inexpressibly delighted to think that the inquiries were to be made by him alone â_oh be satisfied i can understand my father while uttering these word with this expression of joy his teeth clashed together violently dâ avrigny took the young manâ arm and led him out of the room a more than deathlike silence then reigned in the house_of_peers at the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard and m_noirtier_de_villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where dâ avrigny and m_maximilian_morrel had been staying one absorbed in meditation the other in grief you can come he said and led them back to m_noirtier_de_villefort m_maximilian_morrel looked attentively on m_noirtier_de_villefort his face was livid large drops rolled down his face and in his fingers he held the fragments of a quill pen which he had torn to atoms gentlemen he said in a hoarse voice give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves the two man drew back i entreat youâ â continued m_noirtier_de_villefort but said m_maximilian_morrel the culpritâ the murdererâ the assassin â do not alarm yourself sir justice will be done said m_noirtier_de_villefort my father has revealed the culpritâ name my father thirsts for revenge as much as you do yet even he conjures you as i do to keep this secret do you not father â_yes resolutely replied m_noirtier_de_villefort m_maximilian_morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him â_oh sir said m_noirtier_de_villefort arresting m_maximilian_morrel by the arm if my father the inflexible man makes this request it is because he knows be assured that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort will be terribly revenged is it not so father the old man made a sign in the affirmative m_noirtier_de_villefort continued he knows me and i have pledged my word to him
rest assured gentlemen that within three day in a less time than justice would demand the revenge i shall have taken for the murder of my child will be such as to make the boldest heart tremble and as he spoke these word he ground his teeth and grasped the old manâ senseless hand will this promise be fulfilled m_noirtier_de_villefort asked m_maximilian_morrel while dâ avrigny looked inquiringly â_yes replied m_noirtier_de_villefort with an expression of sinister joy swear then said m_noirtier_de_villefort joining the hand of m_maximilian_morrel and dâ avrigny swear that you will spare the honor of my house_of_peers and leave me to avenge my child dâ avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble â_yes but m_maximilian_morrel disengaging his hand rushed to the bed and after having pressed the cold lip of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort with his own hurriedly left uttering a long deep groan of despair and anguish we have before stated that all the servant had fled m_noirtier_de_villefort was therefore obliged to request dâ avrigny to superintend all the arrangements consequent upon a death in a large city more especially a death under such suspicious circumstances it was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair of m_noirtier_de_villefort whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks m_noirtier_de_villefort retired to his study and dâ avrigny left to summon the doctor of the mayoralty whose office it is to examine bodies after decease and who is expressly named the doctor of the dead m_noirtier_de_villefort could not be persuaded to quit his grandchild at the end of a quarter of an hour dâ avrigny returned with his associate they found the outer gate closed and not a servant remaining in the house_of_peers m_noirtier_de_villefort himself was obliged to open to them
but he stopped on the landing he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber the two doctors therefore entered the room alone m_noirtier_de_villefort was near the bed pale motionless and silent as the corpse the district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the lip alas said dâ avrigny she is indeed dead poor child 50099m â_yes answered the doctor laconically dropping the sheet he had raised m_noirtier_de_villefort uttered a kind of hoarse rattling sound the old manâ eye sparkled and the good doctor understood that he wished to behold his child he therefore approached the bed and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lip of the corpse in chloride of lime he uncovered the calm and pale face which looked like that of a sleeping angel a tear which appeared in the old manâ eye expressed his thanks to the doctor the doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner of the table and having fulfilled his duty was conducted out by dâ avrigny m_noirtier_de_villefort met them at the door of his study having in a few word thanked the district doctor he turned to dâ avrigny and said and now the priest â is there any particular priest you wish to pray with mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort asked dâ avrigny no said m_noirtier_de_villefort fetch the nearest â the nearest said the district doctor is a good italian abbã who life next door to you shall i call on him as i pass â dâ avrigny said m_noirtier_de_villefort be so kind i beseech you as to accompany this gentleman
here is the key of the door so that you can go in and out as you please you will bring the priest with you and will oblige me by introducing him into my childâ room 50101m do you wish to see him â i only wish to be alone you will excuse me will you not a priest can understand a fatherâ grief and m_noirtier_de_villefort giving the key to dâ avrigny again bade farewell to the strange doctor and retired to his study where he began to work for some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions as the doctors entered the street they saw a man in a cassock standing on the threshold of the next door this is the abbã of whom i spoke said the doctor to dâ avrigny dâ avrigny accosted the priest sir he said are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter i mean m_noirtier_de_villefort the kingâ attorney â ah said the priest in a marked italian accent â_yes i have heard that death is in that house_of_peers â then i need not tell you what kind of service he requires of you â i was about to offer myself sir said the priest â_it is our mission to forestall our duties â_it is a young girl â i know it sir the servant who fled from the house_of_peers informed me i also know that her name is mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and i have already prayed for her â thank you sir said dâ avrigny since you have commenced your sacred office deign to continue it
come and watch by the dead and all the wretched family will be grateful to you â i am going sir and i do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine dâ avrigny took the priestâ hand and without meeting m_noirtier_de_villefort who was engaged in his study they reached valentineâ room which on the following night was to be occupied by the undertakers on entering the room noirtierâ eye met those of the abbã and no doubt he read some particular expression in them for he remained in the room dâ avrigny recommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the dead and the abbã promised to devote his prayers to mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and his attentions to m_noirtier_de_villefort in order doubtless that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling his sacred mission the priest rose as soon as dâ avrigny departed and not only bolted the door through which the doctor had just left but also that leading to madame de villefortâ room chapter 104 danglarsâ signature the next morning dawned dull and cloudy during the night the undertakers had executed their melancholy office and wrapped the corpse in the winding sheet which whatever may be said about the equality of death is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life this winding sheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric which the young girl had bought a fortnight before during the evening two man engaged for the purpose had carried m_noirtier_de_villefort from valentineâ room into his own and contrary to all expectation there was no difficulty in withdrawing him from his child the abbã_busoni had watched till daylight and then left without calling anyone
dâ avrigny returned about eight oâ clock in the morning he met m_noirtier_de_villefort on his way to noirtierâ room and accompanied him to see how the old man had slept they found him in the large armchair which served him for a bed enjoying a calm nay almost a smiling sleep they both stood in amazement at the door see said dâ avrigny to m_noirtier_de_villefort nature knows how to alleviate the deepest sorrow no one can say that m_noirtier_de_villefort did not love his child and yet he sleeps â_yes you are right replied m_noirtier_de_villefort surprised he sleeps indeed and this is the more strange since the least contradiction keeps him awake all night â grief has stunned him replied dâ avrigny and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureurâ study see i have not slept said m_noirtier_de_villefort showing his undisturbed bed grief does not stun me i have not been in bed for two night but then look at my desk see what i have written during these two day and night i have filled those paper and have made out the accusation against the assassin m_benedetto oh work work my passion my joy my delight â_it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows and he convulsively grasped the hand of dâ avrigny do you require my services now asked dâ avrigny no said m_noirtier_de_villefort only return again at eleven oâ clock at twelve theâ theâ oh heavens my poor poor child and the procureur again becoming a man lifted up his eye and groaned shall you be present in the reception room â no i have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office i shall work doctorâ when i work i forget everything and indeed no sooner had the doctor left the room than he was again absorbed in work
on the doorsteps dâ avrigny met the cousin whom m_noirtier_de_villefort had mentioned a personage as insignificant in our story as in the world he occupiedâ one of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to others he was punctual dressed in black with crape around his hat and presented himself at his cousinâ with a face made up for the occasion and which he could alter as might be required at eleven oâ clock the mourning coaches rolled into the paved court and the rue du faubourg saint honorã was filled with a crowd of idlers equally pleased to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich and who rush with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the marriage of a duchess gradually the reception room filled and some of our old friend made their appearanceâ we mean m_lucien_debray baron_de_chã_teau_renaud and m_beauchamp accompanied by all the leading man of the day at the bar in literature or the army for m_noirtier_de_villefort moved in the first parisian circles less owing to his social position than to his personal merit the cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests and it was rather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves and who did not exact a mournful face or force tears as would have been the case with a father a brother or a lover those who were acquainted soon formed into little groups one of them was made of m_lucien_debray baron_de_chã_teau_renaud and m_beauchamp poor girl said m_lucien_debray like the rest paying an involuntary tribute to the sad event â poor girl so young so rich so beautiful could you have imagined this scene baron_de_chã_teau_renaud when we saw her at the most three weeks ago about to sign that contract â indeed no said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud â did
you know her â i spoke to her once or twice at madame de morcerfâ among the rest she appeared to me charming though rather melancholy where is her stepmother do you know â she is spending the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who is receiving us 50105m who is he â whom do you mean â the gentleman who receives us is he a deputy â_oh no i am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day said m_beauchamp but he is perfectly unknown to me â have you mentioned this death in your paper â_it has been mentioned but the article is not mine indeed i doubt if it will please m_noirtier_de_villefort for it says that if four successive death had happened anywhere else than in the house_of_peers of the kingâ attorney he would have interested himself somewhat more about it â still said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud dr dâ avrigny who attends my mother declares he is in despair about it but whom are you seeking m_lucien_debray â i am seeking the count of monte cristoâ said the young man i met him on the boulevard on my way here said m_beauchamp i think he is about to leave paris he was going to his banker â his banker mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars is his banker is he not asked baron_de_chã_teau_renaud of m_lucien_debray i believe so replied the secretary with slight uneasiness but count_of_monte_cristo is not the only one i miss here i do not see m_maximilian_morrel â m_maximilian_morrel do they know him asked baron_de_chã_teau_renaud i think he has only been introduced to madame m_noirtier_de_villefort â still he ought to have been here said m_lucien_debray i wonder what will be talked about tonight this funeral is the news of the day
but hush here comes our minister of justice he will feel obliged to make some little speech to the cousin and the three young man drew near to listen m_beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had met count_of_monte_cristo who was directing his step towards the rue de la chaussã dâ antin to danglarsâ the banker saw the carriage of the count enter the courtyard and advanced to meet him with a sad though affable smile well said he extending his hand to count_of_monte_cristo i suppose you have come to sympathize with me for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my house_of_peers when i perceived you i was just asking myself whether i had not wished harm towards those poor morcerfs which would have justified the proverb of he who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences them himself well on my word of honor i answered no i wished no ill to viscount_albert_de_morcerf he was a little proud perhaps for a man who like myself has risen from nothing but we all have our faults do you know count that person of our time of lifeâ not that you belong to the class you are still a young man but as i was saying person of our time of life have been very unfortunate this year for example look at the puritanical procureur who has just lost his daughter and in fact nearly all his family in so singular a manner viscount_albert_de_morcerf dishonored and dead and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of m_benedetto besidesâ â besides what asked the count alas do you not know â what new calamity â my daughterâ â mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars has left us â good heavens what are you telling me â the truth my dear count
oh how happy you must be in not having either wife or child â do you think so â indeed i do â and so mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars danglarsâ â she could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch so she asked permission to travel â and is she gone â the other night she left â with madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â no with a relation but still we have quite lost our dear mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars for i doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to france â still baron said count_of_monte_cristo family griefs or indeed any other affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure are endurable to a millionaire philosophers may well say and practical man will always support the opinion that money mitigates many trials and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm you ought to be very easily consoledâ you the king of finance the focus of immeasurable power mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars looked at him askance as though to ascertain whether he spoke seriously â_yes he answered if a fortune brings consolation i ought to be consoled i am rich â so rich dear sir that your fortune resembles the pyramids if you wished to demolish them you could not and if it were possible you would not dare mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars smiled at the good natured pleasantry of the count that reminds me he said that when you entered i was on the point of signing five little bonds i have already signed two will you allow me to do the same to the others â pray do so there was a momentâ silence during which the noise of the bankerâ pen was alone heard while count_of_monte_cristo examined the gilt mouldings on the ceiling are they spanish haitian or neapolitan bonds said count_of_monte_cristo
â no said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars smiling they are bonds on the bank of france payable to bearer stay count he added you who may be called the emperor if i claim the title of king of finance have you many pieces of paper of this size each worth a million the count took into his hand the paper which mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had so proudly presented to him and read â to the governor of the bank please pay to my order from the fund deposited by me the sum of a million and charge the same to my account baron mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â one two three four five said count_of_monte_cristo five millionsâ why what a crå sus you are â this is how i transact business said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â_it is really wonderful said the count above all if as i suppose it is payable at sight â_it is indeed said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â_it is a fine thing to have such credit really it is only in france these thing are done five millions on five little scraps of paper â_it must be seen to be believed â you do not doubt it â no â you say so with an accentâ stay you shall be convinced take my clerk to the bank and you will see him leave it with an order on the treasury for the same sum â no said count_of_monte_cristo folding the five notes most decidedly not the thing is so curious i will make the experiment myself i am credited on you for six millions i have drawn nine hundred thousand franc you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand franc i will take the five scraps of paper that i now hold as bonds with your signature alone and here is a receipt in full for the six millions between us
i had prepared it beforehand for i am much in want of money today and count_of_monte_cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand while with the other he held out the receipt to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars if a thunderbolt had fallen at the bankerâ foot he could not have experienced greater terror what he stammered do you mean to keep that money excuse me excuse me but i owe this money to the charity fund a deposit which i promised to pay this morning â_oh well then said count_of_monte_cristo i am not particular about these five notes pay me in a different form i wished from curiosity to take these that i might be able to say that without any advice or preparation the house_of_peers of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had paid me five millions without a minuteâ delay it would have been remarkable but here are your bonds pay me differently and he held the bonds towards mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who seized them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is being wrested from its grasp suddenly he rallied made a violent effort to restrain himself and then a smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed countenance 50109m certainly he said your receipt is money â_oh dear yes and if you were at rome the house_of_peers of thomson_french_of_rome would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than you have just done â pardon me count pardon me â then i may keep this money â_yes said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars while the perspiration started from the roots of his hair
â yes keep itâ keep it count_of_monte_cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say come reflect if you repent there is still time â no said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars no decidedly no keep my signatures but you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business i intended this money for the charity fund and i seemed to be robbing them if i did not pay them with these precise bonds how absurdâ as if one crown were not as good as another excuse me and he began to laugh loudly but nervously certainly i excuse you said count_of_monte_cristo graciously and pocket them and he placed the bonds in his pocket book but said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars there is still a sum of one hundred thousand franc â_oh a mere nothing said count_of_monte_cristo the balance would come to about that sum but keep it and we shall be quits â count said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars are you speaking seriously â i never joke with bankers said count_of_monte_cristo in a freezing manner which repelled impertinence and he turned to the door just as the valet de chambre announced m_de_boville receiver general of the charities â ma foi said count_of_monte_cristo i think i arrived just in time to obtain your signatures or they would have been disputed with me mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars again became pale and hastened to conduct the count out count_of_monte_cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with m_de_boville who was standing in the waiting room and who was introduced into danglarsâ room as soon as the count had left the countâ serious face was illumined by a faint smile as he noticed the portfolio which the receiver general held in his hand at the door he found his carriage and was immediately driven to the bank
meanwhile mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars repressing all emotion advanced to meet the receiver general we need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lip good morning creditor said he for i wager anything it is the creditor who visits me â you are right baron answered m_de_boville the charities present themselves to you through me the widows and orphans depute me to receive alms to the amount of five millions from you â and yet they say orphans are to be pitied said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars wishing to prolong the jest poor thing â here i am in their name said m_de_boville but did you receive my letter yesterday â_yes â i have brought my receipt 50111m my dear m_de_boville your widows and orphans must oblige me by waiting twenty four hour since de count_of_monte_cristo whom you just saw leaving hereâ you did see him i think â_yes well â well de count_of_monte_cristo has just carried off their five millions â how so â the count has an unlimited credit upon me a credit opened by thomson_french_of_rome he came to demand five millions at once which i paid him with checks on the bank my funds are deposited there and you can understand that if i draw out ten millions on the same day it will appear rather strange to the governor two day will be a different thing said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars smiling come said m_de_boville with a tone of entire incredulity five millions to that gentleman who just left and who bowed to me as though he knew me â perhaps he knows you though you do not know him de count_of_monte_cristo knows everybody â five millions â here is his receipt believe your own eye
m m_de_boville took the paper mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars presented him and read received of baron mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars the sum of five million one hundred thousand franc to be repaid on demand by the house_of_peers of thomson_french_of_rome â_it is really true said m_de_boville do you know the house_of_peers of thomson_french_of_rome â_yes i once had business to transact with it to the amount of 200 000 franc but since then i have not heard it mentioned â_it is one of the best house in europe said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars carelessly throwing down the receipt on his desk and he had five millions in your hand alone why this count_of_monte_cristo must be a nabob â indeed i do not know what he is he has three unlimited creditsâ one on me one on rothschild one on lafitte and you see he added carelessly he has given me the preference by leaving a balance of 100 000 franc m_de_boville manifested signs of extraordinary admiration i must visit him he said and obtain some pious grant from him â_oh you may make sure of him his charities alone amount to 20 000 franc a month â_it is magnificent i will set before him the example of madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf and her son â what example â they gave all their fortune to the hospitals â what fortune â their ownâ de morcerfâ who is deceased â for what reason â because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired â and what are they to live upon â the mother retires into the country and the son enters the army 50113m well i must confess these are scruples â i registered their deed of gift yesterday â and how much did they possess â_oh not muchâ from twelve to thirteen hundred thousand franc
but to return to our millions â certainly said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars in the most natural tone in the world are you then pressed for this money â_yes for the examination of our cash takes place tomorrow â tomorrow why did you not tell me so before why it is as good as a century at what hour does the examination take place â at two oâ clock â send at twelve said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars smiling m_de_boville said nothing but nodded his head and took up the portfolio now i think of it you can do better said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars how do you mean â the receipt of de count_of_monte_cristo is as good as money take it to rothschildâ or lafitteâ and they will take it off your hand at once â what though payable at rome â certainly it will only cost you a discount of 000 or 000 franc the receiver started back ma foi he said i prefer waiting till tomorrow what a proposition â i thought perhaps said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with supreme impertinence that you had a deficiency to make up â indeed said the receiver and if that were the case it would be worth while to make some sacrifice â thank you no sir â then it will be tomorrow â_yes but without fail â ah you are laughing at me send tomorrow at twelve and the bank shall be notified â i will come myself â better still since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you they shook hand by the way said m_de_boville are you not going to the funeral of poor mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort which i met on my road here â no said the banker i have appeared rather ridiculous since that affair of m_benedetto so i remain in the background â bah you are wrong
how were you to blame in that affair â listenâ when one bears an irreproachable name as i do one is rather sensitive â everybody pities you sir and above all mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â poor mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars do you know she is going to embrace a religious life â no â alas it is unhappily but too true the day after the event she decided on leaving paris with a nun of her acquaintance they are gone to seek a very strict convent in italy or spain â_oh it is terrible and m_de_boville retired with this exclamation after expressing acute sympathy with the father but he had scarcely left before mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with an energy of action those can alone understand who have seen robert macaire represented by frã dã rick 24 exclaimed fool then enclosing monte cristoâ receipt in a little pocket book he added â_yes come at twelve oâ clock i shall then be far away then he double locked his door emptied all his drawers collected about fifty thousand franc in bank notes burned several paper left others exposed to view and then commenced writing a letter which he addressed to madame la baronne mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â i will place it on her table myself tonight he murmured then taking a passport from his drawer he said â good it is available for two month longer chapter 105 the cemetery of pã re lachaise m_de_boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort to her last home on earth the weather was dull and stormy a cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the trees and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulevards
m m_noirtier_de_villefort a true parisian considered the cemetery of pã re lachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a parisian family there alone the corpses belonging to him would be surrounded by worthy associates he had therefore purchased a vault which was quickly occupied by members of his family on the front of the monument was inscribed the families of madame_de_saint_mã_ran and m_noirtier_de_villefort for such had been the last wish expressed by poor renã_e valentineâ mother the pompous procession therefore wended its way towards pã re lachaise from the faubourg saint honorã having crossed paris it passed through the faubourg du temple then leaving the exterior boulevards it reached the cemetery more than fifty private carriage followed the twenty mourning coaches and behind them more than five hundred person joined in the procession on foot 50117m these last consisted of all the young people whom valentineâ death had struck like a thunderbolt and who notwithstanding the raw chilliness of the season could not refrain from paying a last tribute to the memory of the beautiful chaste and adorable girl thus cut off in the flower of her youth as they left paris an equipage with four horse at full speed was seen to draw up suddenly it contained count_of_monte_cristo the count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on foot baron_de_chã_teau_renaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his coupã joined him m_beauchamp did the same the count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd he was evidently watching for someone but his search ended in disappointment 50119m where is m_maximilian_morrel he asked do either of these gentlemen know where he is â we have already asked that question said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud for none of us has seen him the count was silent but continued to gaze around him
at length they arrived at the cemetery the piercing eye of count_of_monte_cristo glanced through clusters of bushes and trees and was soon relieved from all anxiety for seeing a shadow glide between the yew trees count_of_monte_cristo recognized him whom he sought one funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent metropolis black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments then follows the melancholy chant of the priests mingled now and then with a sob of anguish escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers the shadow count_of_monte_cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of abã lard and hã loã se placed itself close to the head of the horse belonging to the hearse and following the undertakerâ man arrived with them at the spot appointed for the burial each personâ attention was occupied count_of_monte_cristo saw nothing but the shadow which no one else observed twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes when the procession stopped this shadow was recognized as m_maximilian_morrel who with his coat buttoned up to his throat his face livid and convulsively crushing his hat between his fingers leaned against a tree situated on an elevation commanding the mausoleum so that none of the funeral details could escape his observation everything was conducted in the usual manner
a few man the least impressed of all by the scene pronounced a discourse some deploring this premature death others expatiating on the grief of the father and one very ingenious person quoting the fact that mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort had solicited pardon of her father for criminals on whom the arm of justice was ready to fallâ until at length they exhausted their stores of metaphor and mournful speeches elaborate variations on the stanzas of malherbe to du pã rier count_of_monte_cristo heard and saw nothing or rather he only saw m_maximilian_morrel whose calmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in his heart see said m_beauchamp pointing out m_maximilian_morrel to m_lucien_debray what is he doing up there and they called chã teau renaudâ attention to him how pale he is said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud shuddering he is cold said m_lucien_debray not at all said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud slowly i think he is violently agitated he is very susceptible â bah said m_lucien_debray he scarcely knew mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort you said so yourself â true still i remember he danced three time with her at madame de morcerfâ do you recollect that ball count where you produced such an effect 50121m no i do not replied count_of_monte_cristo without even knowing of what or to whom he was speaking so much was he occupied in watching m_maximilian_morrel who was holding his breath with emotion the discourse is over farewell gentlemen said the count unceremoniously and he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went the funeral being over the guests returned to paris baron_de_chã_teau_renaud looked for a moment for m_maximilian_morrel but while they were watching the departure of the count m_maximilian_morrel had quitted his post and baron_de_chã_teau_renaud failing in his search joined m_lucien_debray and m_beauchamp
monte cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival of m_maximilian_morrel who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators and workmen m_maximilian_morrel threw a glance around but before it reached the spot occupied by count_of_monte_cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer still unperceived the young man knelt down the count with outstretched neck and glaring eye stood in an attitude ready to pounce upon m_maximilian_morrel upon the first occasion m_maximilian_morrel bent his head till it touched the stone then clutching the grating with both hand he murmured â_oh mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort the countâ heart was pierced by the utterance of these two word he stepped forward and touching the young manâ shoulder said i was looking for you my friend count_of_monte_cristo expected a burst of passion but he was deceived for m_maximilian_morrel turning round said calmly â you see i was praying the scrutinizing glance of the count searched the young man from head to foot he then seemed more easy shall i drive you back to paris he asked no thank you â do you wish anything â leave me to pray the count withdrew without opposition but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of m_maximilian_morrel who at length arose brushed the dust from his knees and turned towards paris without once looking back he walked slowly down the rue de la roquette the count dismissing his carriage followed him about a hundred paces behind m_maximilian_morrel crossed the canal and entered the rue meslay by the boulevards five minute after the door had been closed on morrelâ entrance it was again opened for the count
julie was at the entrance of the garden where she was attentively watching penelon who entering with zeal into his profession of gardener was very busy grafting some bengal roses ah count she exclaimed with the delight manifested by every member of the family whenever he visited the rue meslay m_maximilian_morrel has just returned has he not madame asked the count 50123m â_yes i think i saw him pass but pray call m_emmanuel â excuse me madame but i must go up to maximilianâ room this instant replied count_of_monte_cristo i have something of the greatest importance to tell him â go then she said with a charming smile which accompanied him until he had disappeared count_of_monte_cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting from the ground floor to maximilianâ room when he reached the landing he listened attentively but all was still like many old house occupied by a single family the room door was panelled with glass but it was locked m_maximilian_morrel was shut in and it was impossible to see what was passing in the room because a red curtain was drawn before the glass the countâ anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom appeared on the face of that imperturbable man what shall i do he uttered and reflected for a moment shall i ring
no the sound of a bell announcing a visitor will but accelerate the resolution of one in maximilianâ situation and then the bell would be followed by a louder noise count_of_monte_cristo trembled from head to foot and as if his determination had been taken with the rapidity of lightning he struck one of the panes of glass with his elbow the glass was shivered to atoms then withdrawing the curtain he saw m_maximilian_morrel who had been writing at his desk bound from his seat at the noise of the broken window i beg a thousand pardons said the count there is nothing the matter but i slipped down and broke one of your panes of glass with my elbow since it is opened i will take advantage of it to enter your room do not disturb yourselfâ do not disturb yourself and passing his hand through the broken glass the count opened the door m_maximilian_morrel evidently discomposed came to meet count_of_monte_cristo less with the intention of receiving him than to exclude his entry ma foi said count_of_monte_cristo rubbing his elbow itâ all your servantâ fault your stairs are so polished it is like walking on glass â are you hurt sir coldly asked m_maximilian_morrel i believe not but what are you about there you were writing â i â your fingers are stained with ink â ah true i was writing i do sometimes soldier though i am count_of_monte_cristo advanced into the room m_maximilian_morrel was obliged to let him pass but he followed him you were writing said count_of_monte_cristo with a searching look i have already had the honor of telling you i was said m_maximilian_morrel the count looked around him
â your pistols are beside your desk said count_of_monte_cristo pointing with his finger to the pistols on the table i am on the point of starting on a journey replied m_maximilian_morrel disdainfully my friend exclaimed count_of_monte_cristo in a tone of exquisite sweetness sir â my friend my dear m_maximilian_morrel do not make a hasty resolution i entreat you â i make a hasty resolution said m_maximilian_morrel shrugging his shoulders is there anything extraordinary in a journey 50125m m_maximilian_morrel said the count let us both lay aside the mask we have assumed you no more deceive me with that false calmness than i impose upon you with my frivolous solicitude you can understand can you not that to have acted as i have done to have broken that glass to have intruded on the solitude of a friendâ you can understand that to have done all this i must have been actuated by real uneasiness or rather by a terrible conviction m_maximilian_morrel you are going to destroy yourself â indeed count said m_maximilian_morrel shuddering what has put this into your head â i tell you that you are about to destroy yourself continued the count and here is proof of what i say and approaching the desk he removed the sheet of paper which m_maximilian_morrel had placed over the letter he had begun and took the latter in his hand m_maximilian_morrel rushed forward to tear it from him but count_of_monte_cristo perceiving his intention seized his wrist with his iron grasp you wish to destroy yourself said the count you have written it â well said m_maximilian_morrel changing his expression of calmness for one of violenceâ well and if i do intend to turn this pistol against myself who shall prevent meâ who will dare prevent me
all my hopes are blighted my heart is broken my life a burden everything around me is sad and mournful earth has become distasteful to me and human voice distract me it is a mercy to let me die for if i live i shall lose my reason and become mad when sir i tell you all this with tears of heartfelt anguish can you reply that i am wrong can you prevent my putting an end to my miserable existence tell me sir could you have the courage to do so â_yes m_maximilian_morrel said count_of_monte_cristo with a calmness which contrasted strangely with the young manâ excitement â_yes i would do so â you exclaimed m_maximilian_morrel with increasing anger and reproachâ you who have deceived me with false hopes who have cheered and soothed me with vain promises when i might if not have saved her at least have seen her die in my arm you who pretend to understand everything even the hidden sources of knowledge and who enact the part of a guardian angel upon earth and could not even find an antidote to a poison administered to a young girl ah sir indeed you would inspire me with pity were you not hateful in my eye â morrelâ â â_yes you tell me to lay aside the mask and i will do so be satisfied when you spoke to me at the cemetery i answered youâ my heart was softened when you arrived here i allowed you to enter
but since you abuse my confidence since you have devised a new torture after i thought i had exhausted them all then count_of_monte_cristo my pretended benefactorâ then count_of_monte_cristo the universal guardian be satisfied you shall witness the death of your friend and m_maximilian_morrel with a maniacal laugh again rushed towards the pistols and i again repeat you shall not commit suicide â prevent me then replied m_maximilian_morrel with another struggle which like the first failed in releasing him from the countâ iron grasp i will prevent you 50127m and who are you then that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical right over free and rational beings â who am i repeated count_of_monte_cristo listen i am the only man in the world having the right to say to you m_maximilian_morrel your fatherâ son shall not die today â and count_of_monte_cristo with an expression of majesty and sublimity advanced with arm folded toward the young man who involuntarily overcome by the commanding manner of this man recoiled a step why do you mention my father stammered he why do you mingle a recollection of him with the affairs of today â because i am he who saved your fatherâ life when he wished to destroy himself as you do todayâ because i am the man who sent the purse to your young sister and the pharaon to old morrelâ because i am the edmond_dantã_s who nursed you a child on my knees m_maximilian_morrel made another step back staggering breathless crushed then all his strength give way and he fell prostrate at the foot of count_of_monte_cristo
then his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden revulsion he arose rushed out of the room and to the stairs exclaiming energetically mademoiselle_julie julieâ m_emmanuel emmanuel count_of_monte_cristo endeavored also to leave but m_maximilian_morrel would have died rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door which he closed upon the count mademoiselle_julie m_emmanuel and some of the servant ran up in alarm on hearing the cries of m_maximilian_morrel seized their hand and opening the door exclaimed in a voice choked with sobs on your kneesâ on your kneesâ he is our benefactorâ the saviour of our father he isâ â he would have added edmond_dantã_s but the count seized his arm and prevented him mademoiselle_julie threw herself into the arm of the count m_emmanuel embraced him as a guardian angel m_maximilian_morrel again fell on his knees and struck the ground with his forehead then the iron hearted man felt his heart swell in his breast a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his eye he bent his head and wept for a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs while the incense from their grateful heart mounted to heaven mademoiselle_julie had scarcely recovered from her deep emotion when she rushed out of the room descended to the next floor ran into the drawing room with childlike joy and raised the crystal globe which covered the purse given by the unknown of the allã es de meilhan meanwhile m_emmanuel in a broken voice said to the count â_oh count how could you hearing us so often speak of our unknown benefactor seeing us pay such homage of gratitude and adoration to his memory how could you continue so long without discovering yourself to us oh it was cruel to us andâ dare i say it to
you also â listen my friend said the countâ i may call you so since we have really been friend for the last eleven yearsâ the discovery of this secret has been occasioned by a great event which you must never know i wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom but your brother m_maximilian_morrel wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now i am sure then turning around and seeing that m_maximilian_morrel still on his knees had thrown himself into an armchair he added in a low voice pressing emmanuelâ hand significantly watch over him â why so asked the young man surprised i cannot explain myself but watch over him m_emmanuel looked around the room and caught sight of the pistols his eye rested on the weapons and he pointed to them count_of_monte_cristo bent his head m_emmanuel went towards the pistols leave them said count_of_monte_cristo then walking towards m_maximilian_morrel he took his hand the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a profound stupor mademoiselle_julie returned holding the silken purse in her hand while tears of joy rolled down her cheeks like dewdrops on the rose here is the relic she said do not think it will be less dear to us now we are acquainted with our benefactor â my child said count_of_monte_cristo coloring allow me to take back that purse since you now know my face i wish to be remembered alone through the affection i hope you will grant me â_oh said mademoiselle_julie pressing the purse to her heart no no i beseech you do not take it
for some unhappy day you will leave us will you not â you have guessed rightly madame replied count_of_monte_cristo smiling in a week i shall have left this country where so many person who merit the vengeance of heaven lived happily while my father perished of hunger and grief while announcing his departure the count fixed his eye on m_maximilian_morrel and remarked that the word i shall have left this country had failed to rouse him from his lethargy he then saw that he must make another struggle against the grief of his friend and taking the hand of m_emmanuel and mademoiselle_julie which he pressed within his own he said with the mild authority of a father my kind friend leave me alone with m_maximilian_morrel mademoiselle_julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious relic which count_of_monte_cristo had forgotten she drew her husband to the door let us leave them she said the count was alone with m_maximilian_morrel who remained motionless as a statue come said count_of_monte_cristo touching his shoulder with his finger are you a man again m_maximilian_morrel â_yes for i begin to suffer again the count frowned apparently in gloomy hesitation m_maximilian_morrel maximilian he said the idea you yield to are unworthy of a christian â_oh do not fear my friend said m_maximilian_morrel raising his head and smiling with a sweet expression on the count i shall no longer attempt my life â then we are to have no more pistolsâ no more despair â no i have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a knife â poor fellow what is it â my grief will kill me of itself â my friend said count_of_monte_cristo with an expression of melancholy equal to his own listen to me
one day in a moment of despair like yours since it led to a similar resolution i also wished to kill myself one day your father equally desperate wished to kill himself too if anyone had said to your father at the moment he raised the pistol to his headâ if anyone had told me when in my prison i pushed back the food i had not tasted for three daysâ if anyone had said to either of us then liveâ the day will come when you will be happy and will bless life â no matter whose voice had spoken we should have heard him with the smile of doubt or the anguish of incredulity and yet how many time has your father blessed life while embracing youâ how often have i myselfâ â ah exclaimed m_maximilian_morrel interrupting the count you had only lost your liberty my father had only lost his fortune but i have lost mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â look at me said count_of_monte_cristo with that expression which sometimes made him so eloquent and persuasiveâ look at me there are no tears in my eye nor is there fever in my veins yet i see you sufferâ you m_maximilian_morrel whom i love as my own son well does not this tell you that in grief as in life there is always something to look forward to beyond now if i entreat if i order you to live m_maximilian_morrel it is in the conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your life â_oh heavens said the young man â_oh heavensâ what are you saying count take care but perhaps you have never loved â child replied the count i mean as i love you see i have been a soldier ever since i attained manhood
i reached the age of twenty nine without loving for none of the feelings i before then experienced merit the appellation of love well at twenty nine i saw mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort for two year i have loved her for two year i have seen written in her heart as in a book all the virtues of a daughter and wife count to possess mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort would have been a happiness too infinite too ecstatic too complete too divine for this world since it has been denied me but without mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort the earth is desolate â i have told you to hope said the count then have a care i repeat for you seek to persuade me and if you succeed i should lose my reason for i should hope that i could again behold mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort the count smiled my friend my father said m_maximilian_morrel with excitement have a care i again repeat for the power you wield over me alarms me weigh your word before you speak for my eye have already become brighter and my heart beats strongly be cautious or you will make me believe in supernatural agencies i must obey you though you bade me call forth the dead or walk upon the water â hope my friend repeated the count ah said m_maximilian_morrel falling from the height of excitement to the abyss of despairâ ah you are playing with me like those good or rather selfish mother who soothe their child with honeyed word because their screams annoy them no my friend i was wrong to caution you do not fear i will bury my grief so deep in my heart i will disguise it so that you shall not even care to sympathize with me
adieu my friend adieu â on the contrary said the count after this time you must live with meâ you must not leave me and in a week we shall have left france behind us â and you still bid me hope â i tell you to hope because i have a method of curing you â count you render me sadder than before if it be possible you think the result of this blow has been to produce an ordinary grief and you would cure it by an ordinary remedyâ change of scene and m_maximilian_morrel dropped his head with disdainful incredulity what can i say more asked count_of_monte_cristo i have confidence in the remedy i propose and only ask you to permit me to assure you of its efficacy â count you prolong my agony â then said the count your feeble spirit will not even grant me the trial i request comeâ do you know of what the count_of_monte_cristo is capable do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control nay that he can almost work a miracle well wait for the miracle i hope to accomplish orâ â or repeated m_maximilian_morrel or take care m_maximilian_morrel lest i call you ungrateful â have pity on me count â i feel so much pity towards you m_maximilian_morrel thatâ listen to me attentivelyâ if i do not cure you in a month to the day to the very hour mark my word m_maximilian_morrel i will place loaded pistols before you and a cup of the deadliest italian poisonâ a poison more sure and prompt than that which has killed mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â will you promise me â_yes for i am a man and have suffered like yourself and also contemplated suicide indeed often since misfortune has left me i have longed for the delights of an eternal sleep â but
you are sure you will promise me this said m_maximilian_morrel intoxicated i not only promise but swear it said count_of_monte_cristo extending his hand in a month then on your honor if i am not consoled you will let me take my life into my own hand and whatever may happen you will not call me ungrateful â in a month to the day the very hour and the date is a sacred one m_maximilian_morrel i do not know whether you remember that this is the 5th of september it is ten year today since i saved your fatherâ life who wished to die m_maximilian_morrel seized the countâ hand and kissed it the count allowed him to pay the homage he felt due to him in a month you will find on the table at which we shall be then sitting good pistols and a delicious draught but on the other hand you must promise me not to attempt your life before that time â_oh i also swear it count_of_monte_cristo drew the young man towards him and pressed him for some time to his heart and now he said after today you will come and live with me you can occupy haydã eâ apartment and my daughter will at least be replaced by my son â haydã_e said m_maximilian_morrel what has become of her â she departed last night â to leave you â to wait for me hold yourself ready then to join me at the champs lysã es and lead me out of this house_of_peers without anyone seeing my departure m_maximilian_morrel hung his head and obeyed with childlike reverence chapter 106 dividing the proceeds
the apartment on the first floor of the house_of_peers in the rue saint germain des prã where monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf had selected a home for his mother was let to a very mysterious person this was a man whose face the concierge himself had never seen for in the winter his chin was buried in one of the large red handkerchiefs worn by gentlemenâ coachmen on a cold night and in the summer he made a point of always blowing his nose just as he approached the door contrary to custom this gentleman had not been watched for as the report ran that he was a person of high rank and one who would allow no impertinent interference his incognito was strictly respected his visits were tolerably regular though occasionally he appeared a little before or after his time but generally both in summer and winter he took possession of his apartment about four oâ clock though he never spent the night there at half past three in the winter the fire was lighted by the discreet servant who had the superintendence of the little apartment and in the summer ices were placed on the table at the same hour at four oâ clock as we have already stated the mysterious personage arrived twenty minute afterwards a carriage stopped at the house_of_peers a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress and always thickly veiled she passed like a shadow through the lodge and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light foot no one ever asked her where she was going her face therefore like that of the gentleman was perfectly unknown to the two concierges who were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for discretion we need not say she stopped at the first floor
then she tapped in a peculiar manner at a door which after being opened to admit her was again fastened and curiosity penetrated no farther they used the same precautions in leaving as in entering the house_of_peers the lady always left first and as soon as she had stepped into her carriage it drove away sometimes towards the right hand sometimes to the left then about twenty minute afterwards the gentleman would also leave buried in his cravat or concealed by his handkerchief the day after count_of_monte_cristo had called upon mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars the mysterious lodger entered at ten oâ clock in the morning instead of four in the afternoon almost directly afterwards without the usual interval of time a cab arrived and the veiled lady ran hastily upstairs the door opened but before it could be closed the lady exclaimed â_oh lucienâ oh my friend the concierge therefore heard for the first time that the lodgerâ name was m_lucien_debray still as he was the very perfection of a door keeper he made up his mind not to tell his wife well what is the matter my dear asked the gentleman whose name the ladyâ agitation revealed tell me what is the matter â_oh m_lucien_debray can i confide in you â of course you know you can do so but what can be the matter your note of this morning has completely bewildered me this precipitationâ this unusual appointment come ease me of my anxiety or else frighten me at once â m_lucien_debray a great event has happened said the lady glancing inquiringly at m_lucien_debray â mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars left last night â left m mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars left where has he gone â i do not know â what do you mean has he gone intending not to return â undoubtedly at ten oâ clock at night
his horse took him to the barrier of charenton there a post chaise was waiting for himâ he entered it with his valet de chambre saying that he was going to fontainebleau â then what did you meanâ â stayâ he left a letter for me â a letter â_yes read it and the baroness took from her pocket a letter which she gave to m_lucien_debray debray paused a moment before reading as if trying to guess its contents or perhaps while making up his mind how to act whatever it might contain no doubt his idea were arranged in a few minute for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness and which ran as follows â madame and most faithful wife â m_lucien_debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness whose face became covered with blushes read she said m_lucien_debray continued â when you receive this you will no longer have a husband oh you need not be alarmed you will only have lost him as you have lost your daughter i mean that i shall be travelling on one of the thirty or forty roads leading out of france i owe you some explanations for my conduct and as you are a woman that can perfectly understand me i will give them listen then i received this morning five millions which i paid away almost directly afterwards another demand for the same sum was presented to me i put this creditor off till tomorrow and i intend leaving today to escape that tomorrow which would be rather too unpleasant for me to endure you understand this do you not my most precious wife
i say you understand this because you are as conversant with my affairs as i am indeed i think you understand them better since i am ignorant of what has become of a considerable portion of my fortune once very tolerable while i am sure madame that you know perfectly well for woman have infallible instincts they can even explain the marvellous by an algebraic calculation they have invented but i who only understand my own figures know nothing more than that one day these figures deceived me have you admired the rapidity of my fall have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots i confess i have seen nothing but the fire let us hope you have found some gold among the ashes with this consoling idea i leave you madame and most prudent wife without any conscientious reproach for abandoning you you have friend left and the ashes i have already mentioned and above all the liberty i hasten to restore to you and here madame i must add another word of explanation so long as i hoped you were working for the good of our house_of_peers and for the fortune of our daughter i philosophically closed my eye but as you have transformed that house_of_peers into a vast ruin i will not be the foundation of another manâ fortune you were rich when i married you but little respected excuse me for speaking so very candidly but as this is intended only for ourselves i do not see why i should weigh my word i have augmented our fortune and it has continued to increase during the last fifteen year till extraordinary and unexpected catastrophes have suddenly overturned it without any fault of mine i can honestly declare
you madame have only sought to increase your own and i am convinced that you have succeeded i leave you therefore as i took you rich but little respected adieu i also intend from this time to work on my own account accept my acknowledgments for the example you have set me and which i intend following â your very devoted husband â baron mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â the baroness had watched m_lucien_debray while he read this long and painful letter and saw him notwithstanding his self control change color once or twice when he had ended the perusal he folded the letter and resumed his pensive attitude well asked madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with an anxiety easy to be understood well madame unhesitatingly repeated m_lucien_debray with what idea does that letter inspire you â_oh it is simple enough madame it inspires me with the idea that mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars has left suspiciously â certainly but is this all you have to say to me â i do not understand you said m_lucien_debray with freezing coldness he is gone gone never to return â_oh madame do not think that â i tell you he will never return i know his character he is inflexible in any resolutions formed for his own interests if he could have made any use of me he would have taken me with him he leaves me in paris as our separation will conduce to his benefit therefore he has gone and i am free forever added madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars in the same supplicating tone m_lucien_debray instead of answering allowed her to remain in an attitude of nervous inquiry well she said at length do you not answer me â i have but one question to ask you what do you intend to do â i was going to ask you replied the baroness with a beating heart
â ah then you wish to ask advice of me â_yes i do wish to ask your advice said madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with anxious expectation then if you wish to take my advice said the young man coldly i would recommend you to travel â to travel she murmured certainly as mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars says you are rich and perfectly free in my opinion a withdrawal from paris is absolutely necessary after the double catastrophe of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars danglarsâ broken contract and danglarsâ disappearance the world will think you abandoned and poor for the wife of a bankrupt would never be forgiven were she to keep up an appearance of opulence you have only to remain in paris for about a fortnight telling the world you are abandoned and relating the details of this desertion to your best friend who will soon spread the report then you can quit your house_of_peers leaving your jewels and giving up your jointure and everyoneâ mouth will be filled with praises of your disinterestedness they will know you are deserted and think you also poor for i alone know your real financial position and am quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest partner the dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this was equalled by the calm indifference with which m_lucien_debray had spoken deserted she repeated ah yes i am indeed deserted you are right sir and no one can doubt my position these were the only word that this proud and violently enamoured woman could utter in response to m_lucien_debray 50137m but then you are rich very rich indeed continued m_lucien_debray taking out some paper from his pocket book which he spread upon the table
madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars did not see them she was engaged in stilling the beatings of her heart and restraining the tears which were ready to gush forth at length a sense of dignity prevailed and if she did not entirely master her agitation she at least succeeded in preventing the fall of a single tear madame said m_lucien_debray â_it is nearly six month since we have been associated you furnished a principal of 100 000 franc our partnership began in the month of april in may we commenced operations and in the course of the month gained 450 000 franc in june the profit amounted to 900 000 in july we added 700 000 franc â_it was you know the month of the spanish bonds in august we lost 300 000 franc at the beginning of the month but on the 13th we made up for it and we now find that our accounts reckoning from the first day of partnership up to yesterday when i closed them showed a capital of 400 000 franc that is 200 000 for each of us now madame said m_lucien_debray delivering up his accounts in the methodical manner of a stockbroker there are still 80 000 franc the interest of this money in my hand â but said the baroness i thought you never put the money out to interest â excuse me madame said m_lucien_debray coldly i had your permission to do so and i have made use of it there are then 40 000 franc for your share besides the 100 000 you furnished me to begin with making in all 340 000 franc for your portion now madame i took the precaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday it is not long ago you see and i was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up my accounts
there is your money half in bank notes the other half in checks payable to bearer i say there for as i did not consider my house_of_peers safe enough or lawyers sufficiently discreet and as landed property carries evidence with it and moreover since you have no right to possess anything independent of your husband i have kept this sum now your whole fortune in a chest concealed under that closet and for greater security i myself concealed it there now madame continued m_lucien_debray first opening the closet then the chest â now madame here are 800 notes of 000 franc each resembling as you see a large book bound in iron to this i add a certificate in the funds of 25 000 franc then for the odd cash making i think about 110 000 franc here is a check upon my banker who not being mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars will pay you the amount you may rest assured madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars mechanically took the check the bond and the heap of bank notes this enormous fortune made no great appearance on the table madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with tearless eye but with her breast heaving with concealed emotion placed the bank notes in her bag put the certificate and check into her pocket book and then standing pale and mute awaited one kind word of consolation but she waited in vain now madame said m_lucien_debray you have a splendid fortune an income of about 60 000 livres a year which is enormous for a woman who cannot keep an establishment here for a year at least
you will be able to indulge all your fancies besides should you find your income insufficient you can for the sake of the past madame make use of mine and i am ready to offer you all i possess on loan â thank you sirâ thank you replied the baroness you forget that what you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires who intends for some time at least to retire from the world m_lucien_debray was for a moment surprised but immediately recovering himself he bowed with an air which seemed to say as you please madame madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had until then perhaps hoped for something but when she saw the careless bow of m_lucien_debray and the glance by which it was accompanied together with his significant silence she raised her head and without passion or violence or even hesitation ran downstairs disdaining to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from her bah said m_lucien_debray when she had left these are fine projects she will remain at home read novels and speculate at cards since she can no longer do so on the bourse then taking up his account book he cancelled with the greatest care all the entries of the amounts he had just paid away i have 060 000 franc remaining he said what a pity mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars m_noirtier_de_villefort is dead she suited me in every respect and i would have married her and he calmly waited until the twenty minute had elapsed after madame danglarsâ departure before he left the house_of_peers during this time he occupied himself in making figures with his watch by his side
asmodeusâ that diabolical personage who would have been created by every fertile imagination if le sage had not acquired the priority in his great masterpieceâ would have enjoyed a singular spectacle if he had lifted up the roof of the little house_of_peers in the rue saint germain des prã while m_lucien_debray was casting up his figures above the room in which m_lucien_debray had been dividing two millions and a half with madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was another inhabited by person who have played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance not to create some interest mercã_dã_s and monsieur_albert were in that room mercã_dã_s was much changed within the last few day not that even in her day of fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display which makes us no longer able to recognize a woman when she appears in a plain and simple attire nor indeed had she fallen into that state of depression where it is impossible to conceal the garb of misery no the change in mercã_dã_s was that her eye no longer sparkled her lip no longer smiled and there was now a hesitation in uttering the word which formerly sprang so fluently from her ready wit it was not poverty which had broken her spirit it was not a want of courage which rendered her poverty burdensome mercã_dã_s although deposed from the exalted position she had occupied lost in the sphere she had now chosen like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted into utter darkness appeared like a queen fallen from her palace to a hovel and who reduced to strict necessity could neither become reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to place upon the table nor to the humble pallet which had become her bed
the beautiful catalane and noble countess had lost both her proud glance and charming smile because she saw nothing but misery around her the wall were hung with one of the gray paper which economical landlords choose as not likely to show the dirt the floor was uncarpeted the furniture attracted the attention to the poor attempt at luxury indeed everything offended eye accustomed to refinement and elegance madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf had lived there since leaving her house_of_peers the continual silence of the spot oppressed her still seeing that monsieur_albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lip alone which contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from her eye seemed like moonlight on a statue â yielding light without warmth monsieur_albert too was ill at ease the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual position if he wished to go out without gloves his hand appeared too white if he wished to walk through the town his boots seemed too highly polished yet these two noble and intelligent creatures united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and filial love had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another and economizing their stores and monsieur_albert had been able to tell his mother without extorting a change of countenance mother we have no more money 50141m mercã_dã_s had never known misery she had often in her youth spoken of poverty but between want and necessity those synonymous word there is a wide difference amongst the catalans mercã_dã_s wished for a thousand thing but still she never really wanted any
so long as the nets were good they caught fish and so long as they sold their fish they were able to buy twine for new nets and then shut out from friendship having but one affection which could not be mixed up with her ordinary pursuits she thought of herselfâ of no one but herself upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could now there were two to be supported and nothing to live upon winter approached mercã_dã_s had no fire in that cold and naked roomâ she who was accustomed to stoves which heated the house_of_peers from the hall to the boudoir she had not even one little flowerâ she whose apartment had been a conservatory of costly exotics but she had her son hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained them excitement like enthusiasm sometimes renders us unconscious to the thing of earth but the excitement had calmed down and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality after having exhausted the ideal they found they must talk of the actual mother exclaimed monsieur_albert just as madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was descending the stairs let us reckon our riches if you please i want capital to build my plans upon â capitalâ nothing replied mercã_dã_s with a mournful smile no mother capital 000 franc and i have an idea of our leading a delightful life upon this 000 franc â child sighed mercã_dã_s alas dear mother said the young man i have unhappily spent too much of your money not to know the value of it these 000 franc are enormous and i intend building upon this foundation a miraculous certainty for the future â you say this my dear boy but do you think we ought to accept these 000 franc said mercã_dã_s coloring
â i think so answered monsieur_albert in a firm tone we will accept them the more readily since we have them not here you know they are buried in the garden of the little house_of_peers in the allã es de meilhan at marseilles with 200 franc we can reach marseilles â with 200 franc are you sure monsieur_albert â_oh as for that i have made inquiries respecting the diligences and steamboats and my calculations are made you will take your place in the coupã to chã lons you see mother i treat you handsomely for thirty five franc monsieur_albert then took a pen and wrote frs coupã thirty five franc 35 from chã lons to lyons you will go on by the steamboat from lyons to avignon still by steamboat 16 from avignon to marseilles seven franc expenses on the road about fifty franc 50 total 114 frs let us put down 120 added monsieur_albert smiling you see i am generous am i not mother â but you my poor child â i do you not see that i reserve eighty franc for myself a young man does not require luxuries besides i know what travelling is â with a post chaise and valet de chambre â any way mother â well be it so but these 200 franc â here they are and 200 more besides see i have sold my watch for 100 franc and the guard and seals for 300 how fortunate that the ornaments were worth more than the watch still the same story of superfluities
now i think we are rich since instead of the 114 franc we require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of 250 â but we owe something in this house_of_peers â thirty franc but i pay that out of my 150 franc that is understood and as i require only eighty franc for my journey you see i am overwhelmed with luxury but that is not all what do you say to this mother and monsieur_albert took out of a little pocket book with golden clasps a remnant of his old fancies or perhaps a tender souvenir from one of the mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little door monsieur_albert took out of this pocket book a note of 000 franc what is this asked mercã_dã_s a thousand franc â but whence have you obtained them â listen to me mother and do not yield too much to agitation and monsieur_albert rising kissed his mother on both cheeks then stood looking at her you cannot imagine mother how beautiful i think you said the young man impressed with a profound feeling of filial love you are indeed the most beautiful and most noble woman i ever saw â dear child said mercã_dã_s endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear which glistened in the corner of her eye indeed you only wanted misfortune to change my love for you to admiration i am not unhappy while i possess my son â ah just so said monsieur_albert here begins the trial
do you know the decision we have come to mother â have we come to any â_yes it is decided that you are to live at marseilles and that i am to leave for africa where i will earn for myself the right to use the name i now bear instead of the one i have thrown aside mercã_dã_s sighed well mother i yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the spahis 25 added the young man lowering his eye with a certain feeling of shame for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his self abasement i thought my body was my own and that i might sell it i yesterday took the place of another i sold myself for more than i thought i was worth he added attempting to smile i fetched 000 franc â then these 000 francsâ â said mercã_dã_s shuddering are the half of the sum mother the other will be paid in a year mercã_dã_s raised her eye to heaven with an expression it would be impossible to describe and tears which had hitherto been restrained now yielded to her emotion and ran down her cheeks the price of his blood she murmured â_yes if i am killed said monsieur_albert laughing but i assure you mother i have a strong intention of defending my person and i never felt half so strong an inclination to live as i do now â merciful heavens â besides mother why should you make up your mind that i am to be killed has lamoriciã re that ney of the south been killed has changarnier been killed has bedeau been killed has m_maximilian_morrel whom we know been killed think of your joy mother when you see me return with an embroidered uniform
i declare i expect to look magnificent in it and chose that regiment only from vanity mercã_dã_s sighed while endeavoring to smile the devoted mother felt that she ought not to allow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall upon her son well now you understand mother continued monsieur_albert here are more than 000 franc settled on you upon these you can live at least two year â do you think so said mercã_dã_s these word were uttered in so mournful a tone that their real meaning did not escape monsieur_albert he felt his heart beat and taking his motherâ hand within his own he said tenderly â_yes you will live â i shall live then you will not leave me monsieur_albert â mother i must go said monsieur_albert in a firm calm voice you love me too well to wish me to remain useless and idle with you besides i have signed 50145m you will obey your own wish and the will of heaven â not my own wish mother but reasonâ necessity are we not two despairing creatures what is life to you nothing what is life to me very little without you mother for believe me but for you i should have ceased to live on the day i doubted my father and renounced his name well i will live if you promise me still to hope and if you grant me the care of your future prospects you will redouble my strength then i will go to the governor of algeria he has a royal heart and is essentially a soldier i will tell him my gloomy story i will beg him to turn his eye now and then towards me and if he keep his word and interest himself for me in six month i shall be an officer or dead
if i am an officer your fortune is certain for i shall have money enough for both and moreover a name we shall both be proud of since it will be our own if i am killedâ well then mother you can also die and there will be an end of our misfortunes â_it is well replied mercã_dã_s with her eloquent glance you are right my love let us prove to those who are watching our actions that we are worthy of compassion â but let us not yield to gloomy apprehensions said the young man i assure you we are or rather we shall be very happy you are a woman at once full of spirit and resignation i have become simple in my tastes and am without passion i hope once in service i shall be richâ once in dantã sâ house_of_peers you will be at rest let us strive i beseech you let us strive to be cheerful â_yes let us strive for you ought to live and to be happy monsieur_albert â and so our division is made mother said the young man affecting ease of mind we can now part come i shall engage your passage â and you my dear boy â i shall stay here for a few day longer we must accustom ourselves to parting i want recommendations and some information relative to africa i will join you again at marseilles â well be it soâ let us part said mercã_dã_s folding around her shoulders the only shawl she had taken away and which accidentally happened to be a valuable black cashmere monsieur_albert gathered up his paper hastily rang the bell to pay the thirty franc he owed to the landlord and offering his arm to his mother they descended the stairs
someone was walking down before them and this person hearing the rustling of a silk dress turned around m_lucien_debray muttered monsieur_albert you viscount_albert_de_morcerf replied the secretary resting on the stairs curiosity had vanquished the desire of preserving his incognito and he was recognized it was indeed strange in this unknown spot to find the young man whose misfortunes had made so much noise in paris viscount_albert_de_morcerf repeated m_lucien_debray then noticing in the dim light the still youthful and veiled figure of madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf pardon me he added with a smile i leave you monsieur_albert monsieur_albert understood his thoughts mother he said turning towards mercã_dã_s this is m_lucien_debray secretary of the minister for the interior once a friend of mine â how once stammered m_lucien_debray what do you mean â i say so m_lucien_debray because i have no friend now and i ought not to have any i thank you for having recognized me sir m_lucien_debray stepped forward and cordially pressed the hand of his interlocutor believe me dear monsieur_albert he said with all the emotion he was capable of feeling â believe me i feel deeply for your misfortunes and if in any way i can serve you i am yours â thank you sir said monsieur_albert smiling in the midst of our misfortunes we are still rich enough not to require assistance from anyone we are leaving paris and when our journey is paid we shall have 000 franc left
the blood mounted to the temples of m_lucien_debray who held a million in his pocket book and unimaginative as he was he could not help reflecting that the same house_of_peers had contained two woman one of whom justly dishonored had left it poor with 500 000 franc under her cloak while the other unjustly stricken but sublime in her misfortune was yet rich with a few deniers this parallel disturbed his usual politeness the philosophy he witnessed appalled him he muttered a few word of general civility and ran downstairs that day the ministerâ clerks and the subordinates had a great deal to put up with from his ill humor but that same night he found himself the possessor of a fine house_of_peers situated on the boulevard de la madeleine and an income of 50 000 livres the next day just as m_lucien_debray was signing the deed that is about five oâ clock in the afternoon madame de viscount_albert_de_morcerf after having affectionately embraced her son entered the coupã of the diligence which closed upon her a man was hidden in lafitteâ banking house_of_peers behind one of the little arched window which are placed above each desk he saw mercã_dã_s enter the diligence and he also saw monsieur_albert withdraw then he passed his hand across his forehead which was clouded with doubt alas he exclaimed how can i restore the happiness i have taken away from these poor innocent creatures god help me chapter 107 the lionsâ den one division of la force in which the most dangerous and desperate prisoners are confined is called the court of saint bernard the prisoners in their expressive language have named it the lionsâ den probably because the captives possess teeth which frequently gnaw the bars and sometimes the keepers also
it is a prison within a prison the wall are double the thickness of the rest the gratings are every day carefully examined by jailers whose herculean proportions and cold pitiless expression prove them to have been chosen to reign over their subjects for their superior activity and intelligence the courtyard of this quarter is enclosed by enormous wall over which the sun glances obliquely when it deigns to penetrate into this gulf of moral and physical deformity on this paved yard are to be seen pacing to and fro from morning till night pale careworn and haggard like so many shadows the man whom justice holds beneath the steel she is sharpening there crouched against the side of the wall which attracts and retains the most heat they may be seen sometimes talking to one another but more frequently alone watching the door which sometimes opens to call forth one from the gloomy assemblage or to throw in another outcast from society the court of saint bernard has its own particular apartment for the reception of guests it is a long rectangle divided by two upright gratings placed at a distance of three foot from one another to prevent a visitor from shaking hand with or passing anything to the prisoners it is a wretched damp nay even horrible spot more especially when we consider the agonizing conferences which have taken place between those iron bars and yet frightful though this spot may be it is looked upon as a kind of paradise by the man whose day are numbered it is so rare for them to leave the lionsâ den for any other place than the barrier saint jacques the galleys or solitary confinement
in the court which we have attempted to describe and from which a damp vapor was rising a young man with his hand in his pockets who had excited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the den might be seen walking the cut of his clothes would have made him pass for an elegant man if those clothes had not been torn to shreds still they did not show signs of wear and the fine cloth beneath the careful hand of the prisoner soon recovered its gloss in the part which were still perfect for the wearer tried his best to make it assume the appearance of a new coat he bestowed the same attention upon the cambric front of a shirt which had considerably changed in color since his entrance into the prison and he polished his varnished boots with the corner of a handkerchief embroidered with initials surmounted by a coronet some of the inmates of the lionsâ denâ were watching the operations of the prisonerâ toilet with considerable interest see the prince is pluming himself said one of the thieves heâ a fine looking fellow said another if he had only a comb and hair grease heâ take the shine off the gentlemen in white kids â his coat look almost new and his boots shine like a niggerâ face itâ pleasant to have such well dressed comrades but didnâ those gendarmes behave shameful must a been jealous to tear such clothes â he look like a big bug said another dresses in fine style and then to be here so young oh what larks meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket against which one of the keepers was leaning come sir he said lend me twenty franc you will soon be paid you run no risks with me
remember i have relations who possess more millions than you have deniers come i beseech you lend me twenty franc so that i may buy a dressing gown it is intolerable always to be in a coat and boots and what a coat sir for a prince of the m_andrea_cavalcanti the keeper turned his back and shrugged his shoulders he did not even laugh at what would have caused anyone else to do so he had heard so many utter the same thing indeed he heard nothing else come said m_andrea_cavalcanti you are a man void of compassion iâ ll have you turned out this made the keeper turn around and he burst into a loud laugh the prisoners then approached and formed a circle i tell you that with that wretched sum continued m_andrea_cavalcanti i could obtain a coat and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor i am daily expecting â of courseâ of course said the prisoners â anyone can see heâ a gentleman â well then lend him the twenty franc said the keeper leaning on the other shoulder surely you will not refuse a comrade 50151m i am no comrade of these people said the young man proudly you have no right to insult me thus the thieves looked at one another with low murmurs and a storm gathered over the head of the aristocratic prisoner raised less by his own word than by the manner of the keeper the latter sure of quelling the tempest when the waves became too violent allowed them to rise to a certain pitch that he might be revenged on the importunate m_andrea_cavalcanti and besides it would afford him some recreation during the long day
the thieves had already approached m_andrea_cavalcanti some screaming la savateâ la savate 26 a cruel operation which consists in cuffing a comrade who may have fallen into disgrace not with an old shoe but with an iron heeled one others proposed the anguille another kind of recreation in which a handkerchief is filled with sand pebbles and two sous pieces when they have them which the wretches beat like a flail over the head and shoulders of the unhappy sufferer let us horsewhip the fine gentleman said others but m_andrea_cavalcanti turning towards them winked his eye rolled his tongue around his cheeks and smacked his lip in a manner equivalent to a hundred word among the bandits when forced to be silent it was a masonic sign m_caderousse had taught him he was immediately recognized as one of them the handkerchief was thrown down and the iron heeled shoe replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it belonged some voice were heard to say that the gentleman was right that he intended to be civil in his way and that they would set the example of liberty of conscience and the mob retired the keeper was so stupefied at this scene that he took m_andrea_cavalcanti by the hand and began examining his person attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the lionsâ den to something more substantial than mere fascination m_andrea_cavalcanti made no resistance although he protested against it suddenly a voice was heard at the wicket m_benedetto exclaimed an inspector the keeper relaxed his hold i am called said m_andrea_cavalcanti to the visitorsâ room said the same voice you see someone pays me a visit ah my dear sir you will see whether a m_andrea_cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person
and m_andrea_cavalcanti gliding through the court like a black shadow rushed out through the wicket leaving his comrades and even the keeper lost in wonder certainly a call to the visitorsâ room had scarcely astonished m_andrea_cavalcanti less than themselves for the wily youth instead of making use of his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into la force had maintained a rigid silence 50153m everything he said proves me to be under the protection of some powerful person this sudden fortune the facility with which i have overcome all obstacles an unexpected family and an illustrious name awarded to me gold showered down upon me and the most splendid alliances about to be entered into an unhappy lapse of fortune and the absence of my protector have cast me down certainly but not forever the hand which has retreated for a while will be again stretched forth to save me at the very moment when i shall think myself sinking into the abyss why should i risk an imprudent step it might alienate my protector he has two means of extricating me from this dilemma the one by a mysterious escape managed through bribery the other by buying off my judges with gold i will say and do nothing until i am convinced that he has quite abandoned me and thenâ â m_andrea_cavalcanti had formed a plan which was tolerably clever the unfortunate youth was intrepid in the attack and rude in the defence he had borne with the public prison and with privations of all sorts still by degrees nature or rather custom had prevailed and he suffered from being naked dirty and hungry it was at this moment of discomfort that the inspectorâ voice called him to the visiting room m_andrea_cavalcanti felt his heart leap with joy
it was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate and too late for one from the director of the prison or the doctor it must then be the visitor he hoped for behind the grating of the room into which m_andrea_cavalcanti had been led he saw while his eye dilated with surprise the dark and intelligent face of monsieur_bertuccio who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron bars the bolted door and the shadow which moved behind the other grating ah said m_andrea_cavalcanti deeply affected good morning m_benedetto said monsieur_bertuccio with his deep hollow voice youâ you said the young man looking fearfully around him do you not recognize me unhappy child â silence be silent said m_andrea_cavalcanti who knew the delicate sense of hearing possessed by the wall for heavenâ sake do not speak so loud â you wish to speak with me alone do you not said monsieur_bertuccio â_oh yes â that is well and monsieur_bertuccio feeling in his pocket signed to a keeper whom he saw through the window of the wicket read he said what is that asked m_andrea_cavalcanti an order to conduct you to a room and to leave you there to talk to me â_oh cried m_andrea_cavalcanti leaping with joy then he mentally added â still my unknown protector i am not forgotten they wish for secrecy since we are to converse in a private room i understand monsieur_bertuccio has been sent by my protector the keeper spoke for a moment with an official then opened the iron gates and conducted m_andrea_cavalcanti to a room on the first floor the room was whitewashed as is the custom in prisons but it looked quite brilliant to a prisoner though a stove a bed a chair and a table formed the whole of its sumptuous furniture
bertuccio sat down upon the chair m_andrea_cavalcanti threw himself upon the bed the keeper retired now said the steward what have you to tell me â and you said m_andrea_cavalcanti you speak first â_oh no you must have much to tell me since you have come to seek me 50155m well be it so you have continued your course of villany you have robbedâ you have assassinated â well i should say if you had me taken to a private room only to tell me this you might have saved yourself the trouble i know all these thing but there are some with which on the contrary i am not acquainted let us talk of those if you please who sent you â come come you are going on quickly m_benedetto â_yes and to the point let us dispense with useless word who sends you â no one â how did you know i was in prison â i recognized you some time since as the insolent dandy who so gracefully mounted his horse in the champs lysã es â_oh the champs lysã es ah yes we burn as they say at the game of pincette the champs lysã es come let us talk a little about my father â who then am i â you sir you are my adopted father
but it was not you i presume who placed at my disposal 100 000 franc which i spent in four or five month it was not you who manufactured an italian gentleman for my father it was not you who introduced me into the world and had me invited to a certain dinner at auteuil which i fancy i am eating at this moment in company with the most distinguished people in parisâ amongst the rest with a certain procureur whose acquaintance i did very wrong not to cultivate for he would have been very useful to me just now â_it was not you in fact who bailed me for one or two millions when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place come speak my worthy corsican speak â what do you wish me to say â i will help you you were speaking of the champs lysã es just now worthy foster father â well â well in the champs lysã es there resides a very rich gentleman â at whose house_of_peers you robbed and murdered did you not â i believe i did â the count_of_monte_cristo â tis you who have named him as racine says well am i to rush into his arm and strain him to my heart crying my father my father like monsieur_albert pixã rã court 27 do not let us jest gravely replied monsieur_bertuccio and dare not to utter that name again as you have pronounced it â bah said m_andrea_cavalcanti a little overcome by the solemnity of bertuccioâ manner why not â because the person who bears it is too highly favored by heaven to be the father of such a wretch as you â_oh these are fine word â and there will be fine doings if you do not take care â menacesâ i do not fear them
i will sayâ â do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself said monsieur_bertuccio in so calm a tone and with so steadfast a look that m_andrea_cavalcanti was moved to the very soul do you think you have to do with galley slaves or novices in the world m_benedetto you are fallen into terrible hand they are ready to open for youâ make use of them do not play with the thunderbolt they have laid aside for a moment but which they can take up again instantly if you attempt to intercept their movements 50157m my fatherâ i will know who my father is said the obstinate youth i will perish if i must but i will know it what does scandal signify to me what possessions what reputation what pull as m_beauchamp says have i you great people always lose something by scandal notwithstanding your millions come who is my father â i came to tell you â ah cried m_benedetto his eye sparkling with joy just then the door opened and the jailer addressing himself to monsieur_bertuccio said excuse me sir but the examining magistrate is waiting for the prisoner â and so closes our interview said m_andrea_cavalcanti to the worthy steward i wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil â i will return tomorrow said monsieur_bertuccio good gendarmes i am at your service ah sir do leave a few crowns for me at the gate that i may have some thing i am in need of â_it shall be done replied monsieur_bertuccio m_andrea_cavalcanti extended his hand monsieur_bertuccio kept his own in his pocket and merely jingled a few pieces of money thatâ what i mean said m_andrea_cavalcanti endeavoring to smile quite overcome by the strange tranquillity of monsieur_bertuccio can
i be deceived he murmured as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they call the salad basket â never mind we shall see tomorrow then he added turning towards monsieur_bertuccio tomorrow replied the steward chapter 108 the judge we remember that the abbã_busoni remained alone with m_noirtier_de_villefort in the chamber of death and that the old man and the priest were the sole guardians of the young girlâ body perhaps it was the christian exhortations of the abbã perhaps his kind charity perhaps his persuasive word which had restored the courage of m_noirtier_de_villefort for ever since he had conversed with the priest his violent despair had yielded to a calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive affection for mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort m_noirtier_de_villefort had not seen his father since the morning of the death the whole establishment had been changed another valet was engaged for himself a new servant for m_noirtier_de_villefort two woman had entered madame de villefortâ service in fact everywhere to the concierge and coachmen new face were presented to the different masters of the house_of_peers thus widening the division which had always existed between the members of the same family the assizes also were about to begin and m_noirtier_de_villefort shut up in his room exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of m_caderousse this affair like all those in which the count_of_monte_cristo had interfered caused a great sensation in paris the proofs were certainly not convincing since they rested upon a few word written by an escaped galley slave on his death bed and who might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion
but the mind of the procureur was made up he felt assured that m_benedetto was guilty and he hoped by his skill in conducting this aggravated case to flatter his self love which was about the only vulnerable point left in his frozen heart the case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of m_noirtier_de_villefort who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming assizes he had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever to evade the enormous number of applications presented to him for the purpose of obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of trial and then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and the gloom which overshadowed the house_of_peers was so recent that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties which were the only means he had of dissipating his grief once only had m_noirtier_de_villefort seen his father it was the day after that upon which monsieur_bertuccio had paid his second visit to m_benedetto when the latter was to learn his fatherâ name the magistrate harassed and fatigued had descended to the garden of his house_of_peers and in a gloomy mood similar to that in which tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies he began knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the rose trees which placed along the avenue seemed like the spectres of the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season
more than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous boarded gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure always returning by the same path to begin his walk again at the same pace and with the same gesture when he accidentally turned his eye towards the house_of_peers whence he heard the noisy play of his son who had returned from school to spend the sunday and monday with his mother while doing so he observed m_noirtier_de_villefort at one of the open window where the old man had been placed that he might enjoy the last rays of the sun which yet yielded some heat and was now shining upon the dying flowers and red leaves of the creeper which twined around the balcony the eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which m_noirtier_de_villefort could scarcely distinguish his glance was so full of hate of ferocity and savage impatience that m_noirtier_de_villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing to see upon what person this dark look was directed then he saw beneath a thick clump of linden trees which were nearly divested of foliage madame m_noirtier_de_villefort sitting with a book in her hand the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son or to throw back his elastic ball which he obstinately threw from the drawing room into the garden m_noirtier_de_villefort became pale he understood the old manâ meaning m_noirtier_de_villefort continued to look at the same object but suddenly his glance was transferred from the wife to the husband and m_noirtier_de_villefort himself had to submit to the searching investigation of eye which while changing their direction and even their language had lost none of their menacing expression
madame m_noirtier_de_villefort unconscious of the passions that exhausted their fire over her head at that moment held her sonâ ball and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a kiss edward begged for a long while the maternal kiss probably not offering sufficient recompense for the trouble he must take to obtain it however at length he decided leaped out of the window into a cluster of heliotropes and daisies and ran to his mother his forehead streaming with perspiration madame m_noirtier_de_villefort wiped his forehead pressed her lip upon it and sent him back with the ball in one hand and some bonbons in the other m_noirtier_de_villefort drawn by an irresistible attraction like that of the bird to the serpent walked towards the house_of_peers as he approached it noirtierâ gaze followed him and his eye appeared of such a fiery brightness that m_noirtier_de_villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his heart in that earnest look might be read a deep reproach as well as a terrible menace then m_noirtier_de_villefort raised his eye to heaven as though to remind his son of a forgotten oath â_it is well sir replied m_noirtier_de_villefort from below â_it is well have patience but one day longer what i have said i will do m_noirtier_de_villefort seemed to be calmed by these word and turned his eye with indifference to the other side m_noirtier_de_villefort violently unbuttoned his greatcoat which seemed to strangle him and passing his livid hand across his forehead entered his study
the night was cold and still the family had all retired to rest but m_noirtier_de_villefort who alone remained up and worked till five oâ clock in the morning reviewing the last interrogatories made the night before by the examining magistrates compiling the depositions of the witnesses and putting the finishing stroke to the deed of accusation which was one of the most energetic and best conceived of any he had yet delivered the next day monday was the first sitting of the assizes the morning dawned dull and gloomy and m_noirtier_de_villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon the lines he had traced in red ink the magistrate had slept for a short time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles its flickerings awoke him and he found his fingers as damp and purple as though they had been dipped in blood he opened the window a bright yellow streak crossed the sky and seemed to divide in half the poplars which stood out in black relief on the horizon in the clover fields beyond the chestnut trees a lark was mounting up to heaven while pouring out her clear morning song the damps of the dew bathed the head of m_noirtier_de_villefort and refreshed his memory today he said with an effort â today the man who holds the blade of justice must strike wherever there is guilt involuntarily his eye wandered towards the window of noirtierâ room where he had seen him the preceding night the curtain was drawn and yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed the closed window as though it had been open and as if through the opening he had beheld the menacing old man â_yes he murmured â_yes be satisfied
his head dropped upon his chest and in this position he paced his study then he threw himself dressed as he was upon a sofa less to sleep than to rest his limbs cramped with cold and study by degrees everyone awoke m_noirtier_de_villefort from his study heard the successive noises which accompany the life of a house_of_peers the opening and shutting of door the ringing of madame de villefortâ bell to summon the waiting maid mingled with the first shouts of the child who rose full of the enjoyment of his age m_noirtier_de_villefort also rang his new valet brought him the paper and with them a cup of chocolate what are you bringing me said he a cup of chocolate â i did not ask for it who has paid me this attention â my mistress sir she said you would have to speak a great deal in the murder case and that you should take something to keep up your strength and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the sofa which was like all the rest covered with paper the valet then left the room m_noirtier_de_villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression then suddenly taking it up with a nervous motion he swallowed its contents at one draught it might have been thought that he hoped the beverage would be mortal and that he sought for death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil he then rose and paced his room with a smile it would have been terrible to witness the chocolate was inoffensive for m_noirtier_de_villefort felt no effects the breakfast hour arrived but m_noirtier_de_villefort was not at table the valet re entered
â madame m_noirtier_de_villefort wishes to remind you sir he said that eleven oâ clock has just struck and that the trial commences at twelve â well said m_noirtier_de_villefort what then â madame m_noirtier_de_villefort is dressed she is quite ready and wishes to know if she is to accompany you sir â where to â to the palais â what to do â my mistress wishes much to be present at the trial â ah said m_noirtier_de_villefort with a startling accent does she wish that the servant drew back and said if you wish to go alone sir i will go and tell my mistress m_noirtier_de_villefort remained silent for a moment and dented his pale cheeks with his nails tell your mistress he at length answered that i wish to speak to her and i beg she will wait for me in her own room â_yes sir â then come to dress and shave me â directly sir the valet re appeared almost instantly and having shaved his master assisted him to dress entirely in black when he had finished he said my mistress said she should expect you sir as soon as you had finished dressing â i am going to her and m_noirtier_de_villefort with his paper under his arm and hat in hand directed his step toward the apartment of his wife at the door he paused for a moment to wipe his damp pale brow he then entered the room madame m_noirtier_de_villefort was sitting on an ottoman and impatiently turning over the leaves of some newspapers and pamphlets which young edward by way of amusing himself was tearing to pieces before his mother could finish reading them she was dressed to go out her bonnet was placed beside her on a chair and her gloves were on her hand ah here you are monsieur_albert
she said in her naturally calm voice but how pale you are have you been working all night why did you not come down to breakfast well will you take me or shall i take edward madame m_noirtier_de_villefort had multiplied her questions in order to gain one answer but to all her inquiries m_noirtier_de_villefort remained mute and cold as a statue edward said m_noirtier_de_villefort fixing an imperious glance on the child go and play in the drawing room my dear i wish to speak to your mamma madame m_noirtier_de_villefort shuddered at the sight of that cold countenance that resolute tone and the awfully strange preliminaries edward raised his head looked at his mother and then finding that she did not confirm the order began cutting off the head of his leaden soldiers edward cried m_noirtier_de_villefort so harshly that the child started up from the floor do you hear me go the child unaccustomed to such treatment arose pale and trembling it would be difficult to say whether his emotion were caused by fear or passion his father went up to him took him in his arm and kissed his forehead go he said go my child edward ran out m_noirtier_de_villefort went to the door which he closed behind the child and bolted dear me said the young woman endeavoring to read her husbandâ inmost thoughts while a smile passed over her countenance which froze the impassibility of m_noirtier_de_villefort what is the matter â madame where do you keep the poison you generally use said the magistrate without any introduction placing himself between his wife and the door madame m_noirtier_de_villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which looking up sees the murderous trap closing over its head
a hoarse broken tone which was neither a cry nor a sigh escaped from her while she became deadly pale monsieur_albert she said iâ i do not understand you and in her first paroxysm of terror she had raised herself from the sofa in the next stronger very likely than the other she fell down again on the cushions i asked you continued m_noirtier_de_villefort in a perfectly calm tone where you conceal the poison by the aid of which you have killed my father in law de madame_de_saint_mã_ran my mother in law madame_de_saint_mã_ran barrois and my daughter mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â ah sir exclaimed madame m_noirtier_de_villefort clasping her hand what do you say â_it is not for you to interrogate but to answer â is it to the judge or to the husband stammered madame m_noirtier_de_villefort to the judgeâ to the judge madame â_it was terrible to behold the frightful pallor of that woman the anguish of her look the trembling of her whole frame ah sir she muttered ah sir and this was all you do not answer madame exclaimed the terrible interrogator then he added with a smile yet more terrible than his anger â_it is true then you do not deny it she moved forward and you cannot deny it added m_noirtier_de_villefort extending his hand toward her as though to seize her in the name of justice you have accomplished these different crimes with impudent address but which could only deceive those whose affections for you blinded them since the death of madame_de_saint_mã_ran i have known that a poisoner lived in my house_of_peers dâ avrigny warned me of it
after the death of barrois my suspicions were directed towards an angel those suspicions which even when there is no crime are always alive in my heart but after the death of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort there has been no doubt in my mind madame and not only in mine but in those of others thus your crime known by two person suspected by many will soon become public and as i told you just now you no longer speak to the husband but to the judge 50165m the young woman hid her face in her hand â_oh sir she stammered i beseech you do not believe appearances â are you then a coward cried m_noirtier_de_villefort in a contemptuous voice but i have always observed that poisoners were cowards can you be a coward you who have had the courage to witness the death of two old man and a young girl murdered by you â sir sir â can you be a coward continued m_noirtier_de_villefort with increasing excitement you who could count one by one the minute of four death agonies you who have arranged your infernal plans and removed the beverages with a talent and precision almost miraculous have you then who have calculated everything with such nicety have you forgotten to calculate one thingâ i mean where the revelation of your crimes will lead you to oh it is impossibleâ you must have saved some surer more subtle and deadly poison than any other that you might escape the punishment that you deserve you have done thisâ i hope so at least madame m_noirtier_de_villefort stretched out her hand and fell on her knees
â i understand he said you confess but a confession made to the judges a confession made at the last moment extorted when the crime cannot be denied diminishes not the punishment inflicted on the guilty â the punishment exclaimed madame m_noirtier_de_villefort the punishment monsieur_albert twice you have pronounced that word â certainly did you hope to escape it because you were four time guilty did you think the punishment would be withheld because you are the wife of him who pronounces it no madame no the scaffold awaits the poisoner whoever she may be unless as i just said the poisoner has taken the precaution of keeping for herself a few drops of her deadliest poison madame m_noirtier_de_villefort uttered a wild cry and a hideous and uncontrollable terror spread over her distorted features â_oh do not fear the scaffold madame said the magistrate i will not dishonor you since that would be dishonor to myself no if you have heard me distinctly you will understand that you are not to die on the scaffold â no i do not understand what do you mean stammered the unhappy woman completely overwhelmed i mean that the wife of the first magistrate in the capital shall not by her infamy soil an unblemished name that she shall not with one blow dishonor her husband and her child â no noâ oh no â well madame it will be a laudable action on your part and i will thank you for it â you will thank meâ for what â for what you have just said â what did i say oh my brain whirls i no longer understand anything oh my god my god and she rose with her hair dishevelled and her lip foaming have you answered the question i put to you on entering the room where
do you keep the poison you generally use madame madame m_noirtier_de_villefort raised her arm to heaven and convulsively struck one hand against the other no no she vociferated no you cannot wish that 50169m what i do not wish madame is that you should perish on the scaffold do you understand asked m_noirtier_de_villefort â_oh mercy mercy monsieur_albert â what i require is that justice be done i am on the earth to punish madame he added with a flaming glance any other woman were it the queen herself i would send to the executioner but to you i shall be merciful to you i will say have you not madame put aside some of the surest deadliest most speedy poison â 50170m â_oh pardon me sir let me live â she is cowardly said m_noirtier_de_villefort reflect that i am your wife â you are a poisoner â in the name of heaven â no â in the name of the love you once bore me â no no â in the name of our child ah for the sake of our child let me live 50167m no no no i tell you one day if i allow you to live you will perhaps kill him as you have the others â i i kill my boy cried the distracted mother rushing toward m_noirtier_de_villefort i kill my son ha ha ha and a frightful demoniac laugh finished the sentence which was lost in a hoarse rattle madame m_noirtier_de_villefort fell at her husbandâ foot he approached her think of it madame he said if on my return justice has not been satisfied i will denounce you with my own mouth and arrest you with my own hand she listened panting overwhelmed crushed her eye alone lived and glared horribly do you understand me he said
â i am going down there to pronounce the sentence of death against a murderer if i find you alive on my return you shall sleep tonight in the conciergerie madame m_noirtier_de_villefort sighed her nerves gave way and she sunk on the carpet the kingâ attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity he looked upon her less severely and bowing to her said slowly farewell madame farewell that farewell struck madame m_noirtier_de_villefort like the executionerâ knife she fainted the procureur went out after having double locked the door chapter 109 the assizes the m_benedetto affair as it was called at the palais and by people in general had produced a tremendous sensation frequenting the cafã de paris the boulevard de gand and the bois de boulogne during his brief career of splendor the false m_andrea_cavalcanti had formed a host of acquaintances the paper had related his various adventures both as the man of fashion and the galley slave and as everyone who had been personally acquainted with prince m_andrea_cavalcanti experienced a lively curiosity in his fate they all determined to spare no trouble in endeavoring to witness the trial of m_benedetto for the murder of his comrade in chains in the eye of many m_benedetto appeared if not a victim to at least an instance of the fallibility of the law m_andrea_cavalcanti his father had been seen in paris and it was expected that he would re appear to claim the illustrious outcast many also who were not aware of the circumstances attending his withdrawal from paris were struck with the worthy appearance the gentlemanly bearing and the knowledge of the world displayed by the old patrician who certainly played the nobleman very well so long as he said nothing and made no arithmetical calculations
as for the accused himself many remembered him as being so amiable so handsome and so liberal that they chose to think him the victim of some conspiracy since in this world large fortune frequently excite the malevolence and jealousy of some unknown enemy everyone therefore ran to the court some to witness the sight others to comment upon it from seven oâ clock in the morning a crowd was stationed at the iron gates and an hour before the trial commenced the hall was full of the privileged before the entrance of the magistrates and indeed frequently afterwards a court of justice on day when some especial trial is to take place resembles a drawing room where many person recognize each other and converse if they can do so without losing their seats or if they are separated by too great a number of lawyers communicate by signs it was one of the magnificent autumn day which make amends for a short summer the clouds which m_noirtier_de_villefort had perceived at sunrise had all disappeared as if by magic and one of the softest and most brilliant day of september shone forth in all its splendor m_beauchamp one of the kings of the press and therefore claiming the right of a throne everywhere was eying everybody through his monocle he perceived baron_de_chã_teau_renaud and m_lucien_debray who had just gained the good graces of a sergeant at arm and who had persuaded the latter to let them stand before instead of behind him as they ought to have done the worthy sergeant had recognized the ministerâ secretary and the millionnaire and by way of paying extra attention to his noble neighbors promised to keep their place while they paid a visit to m_beauchamp
â well said m_beauchamp we shall see our friend â_yes indeed replied m_lucien_debray that worthy prince deuce take those italian princes â a man too who could boast of dante for a genealogist and could reckon back to the divina comedia â a nobility of the rope said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud phlegmatically he will be condemned will he not asked m_lucien_debray of m_beauchamp my dear fellow i think we should ask you that question you know such news much better than we do did you see the president at the ministerâ last night â_yes â what did he say â something which will surprise you â_oh make haste and tell me then it is a long time since that has happened â well he told me that m_benedetto who is considered a serpent of subtlety and a giant of cunning is really but a very commonplace silly rascal and altogether unworthy of the experiments that will be made on his phrenological organs after his death â bah said m_beauchamp he played the prince very well â_yes for you who detest those unhappy princes m_beauchamp and are always delighted to find fault with them but not for me who discover a gentleman by instinct and who scent out an aristocratic family like a very bloodhound of heraldry â then you never believed in the principality â_yes in the principality but not in the prince â not so bad said m_beauchamp still i assure you he passed very well with many people i saw him at the ministersâ house â ah yes said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud the idea of thinking ministers understand anything about princes â there is something in what you have just said said m_beauchamp laughing but said m_lucien_debray to m_beauchamp if i spoke to the president
you must have been with the procureur â_it was an impossibility for the last week m_noirtier_de_villefort has secluded himself it is natural enough this strange chain of domestic afflictions followed by the no less strange death of his daughterâ â strange what do you mean m_beauchamp â_oh yes do you pretend that all this has been unobserved at the ministerâ â said m_beauchamp placing his eye glass in his eye where he tried to make it remain my dear sir said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud allow me to tell you that you do not understand that manå uvre with the eye glass half so well as m_lucien_debray give him a lesson m_lucien_debray â stay said m_beauchamp surely i am not deceived â what is it â_it is she â whom do you mean â they said she had left â mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud has she returned â no but her mother â madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars nonsense impossible said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud only ten day after the flight of her daughter and three day from the bankruptcy of her husband m_lucien_debray colored slightly and followed with his eye the direction of beauchampâ glance come he said â_it is only a veiled lady some foreign princess perhaps the mother of m_andrea_cavalcanti but you were just speaking on a very interesting topic m_beauchamp â i â_yes you were telling us about the extraordinary death of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort â ah yes so i was but how is it that madame m_noirtier_de_villefort is not here â poor dear woman said m_lucien_debray she is no doubt occupied in distilling balm for the hospitals or in making cosmetics for herself or friend do you know she spends two or three thousand crowns a year in this amusement but i wonder she is not here i should have been pleased to see her for i like her very much â and i hate her said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud why
â i do not know why do we love why do we hate i detest her from antipathy â or rather by instinct â perhaps so but to return to what you were saying m_beauchamp â well do you know why they die so multitudinously at de villefortâ â â multitudinouslyâ is good said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud my good fellow youâ ll find the word in saint simon â but the thing itself is at de villefortâ but letâ get back to the subject â talking of that said m_lucien_debray madame was making inquiries about that house_of_peers which for the last three month has been hung with black â who is madame asked baron_de_chã_teau_renaud the ministerâ wife pardieu â_oh your pardon i never visit ministers i leave that to the princes â really you were only before sparkling but now you are brilliant take compassion on us or like jupiter you will wither us up â i will not speak again said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud pray have compassion upon me and do not take up every word i say â come let us endeavor to get to the end of our story m_beauchamp i told you that yesterday madame made inquiries of me upon the subject enlighten me and i will then communicate my information to her â well gentlemen the reason people die so multitudinously i like the word at de villefortâ is that there is an assassin in the house_of_peers the two young man shuddered for the same idea had more than once occurred to them and who is the assassin they asked together young edward a burst of laughter from the auditors did not in the least disconcert the speaker who continued â_yes gentlemen edward the infant phenomenon who is quite an adept in the art of killing â you are jesting â not at all
i yesterday engaged a servant who had just left de villefortâ i intend sending him away tomorrow for he eats so enormously to make up for the fast imposed upon him by his terror in that house_of_peers well now listen â we are listening â_it appears the dear child has obtained possession of a bottle containing some drug which he every now and then uses against those who have displeased him first and madame_de_saint_mã_ran incurred his displeasure so he poured out three drops of his elixirâ three drops were sufficient then followed barrois the old servant of m_noirtier_de_villefort who sometimes rebuffed this little wretchâ he therefore received the same quantity of the elixir the same happened to mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort of whom he was jealous he gave her the same dose as the others and all was over for her as well as the rest â why what nonsense are you telling us said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud â_yes it is an extraordinary story said m_beauchamp is it not â_it is absurd said m_lucien_debray ah said m_beauchamp you doubt me well you can ask my servant or rather him who will no longer be my servant tomorrow it was the talk of the house_of_peers â and this elixir where is it what is it â the child conceals it â but where did he find it â in his motherâ laboratory â does his mother then keep poisons in her laboratory â how can i tell you are questioning me like a kingâ attorney i only repeat what i have been told and like my informant i can do no more the poor devil would eat nothing from fear â_it is incredible â no my dear fellow it is not at all incredible
you saw the child pass through the rue richelieu last year who amused himself with killing his brothers and sisters by sticking pins in their ears while they slept the generation who follow us are very precocious â come m_beauchamp said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud i will bet anything you do not believe a word of all you have been telling us but i do not see the count_of_monte_cristo here â he is worn out said m_lucien_debray besides he could not well appear in public since he has been the dupe of the m_andrea_cavalcanti who it appears presented themselves to him with false letter of credit and cheated him out of 100 000 franc upon the hypothesis of this principality â by the way de baron_de_chã_teau_renaud asked m_beauchamp how is m_maximilian_morrel â ma foi i have called three time without once seeing him still his sister did not seem uneasy and told me that though she had not seen him for two or three day she was sure he was well â ah now i think of it the count_of_monte_cristo cannot appear in the hall said m_beauchamp why not â because he is an actor in the drama â has he assassinated anyone then â no on the contrary they wished to assassinate him you know that it was in leaving his house_of_peers that de m_caderousse was murdered by his friend m_benedetto you know that the famous waistcoat was found in his house_of_peers containing the letter which stopped the signature of the marriage contract do you see the waistcoat there it is all blood stained on the desk as a testimony of the crime â ah very good â hush gentlemen here is the court let us go back to our place
a noise was heard in the hall the sergeant called his two patrons with an energetic hem and the door keeper appearing called out with that shrill voice peculiar to his order ever since the day of beaumarchais the court gentlemen chapter 110 the indictment the judges took their place in the midst of the most profound silence the jury took their seats m_noirtier_de_villefort the object of unusual attention and we had almost said of general admiration sat in the armchair and cast a tranquil glance around him everyone looked with astonishment on that grave and severe face whose calm expression personal griefs had been unable to disturb and the aspect of a man who was a stranger to all human emotions excited something very like terror gendarmes said the president lead in the accused at these word the public attention became more intense and all eye were turned towards the door through which m_benedetto was to enter the door soon opened and the accused appeared the same impression was experienced by all present and no one was deceived by the expression of his countenance his features bore no sign of that deep emotion which stops the beating of the heart and blanches the cheek his hand gracefully placed one upon his hat the other in the opening of his white waistcoat were not at all tremulous his eye was calm and even brilliant scarcely had he entered the hall when he glanced at the whole body of magistrates and assistants his eye rested longer on the president and still more so on the kingâ attorney
by the side of m_andrea_cavalcanti was stationed the lawyer who was to conduct his defence and who had been appointed by the court for m_andrea_cavalcanti disdained to pay any attention to those details to which he appeared to attach no importance the lawyer was a young man with light hair whose face expressed a hundred time more emotion than that which characterized the prisoner 50181 the president called for the indictment revised as we know by the clever and implacable pen of m_noirtier_de_villefort during the reading of this which was long the public attention was continually drawn towards m_andrea_cavalcanti who bore the inspection with spartan unconcern m_noirtier_de_villefort had never been so concise and eloquent the crime was depicted in the most vivid colors the former life of the prisoner his transformation a review of his life from the earliest period were set forth with all the talent that a knowledge of human life could furnish to a mind like that of the procureur m_benedetto was thus forever condemned in public opinion before the sentence of the law could be pronounced m_andrea_cavalcanti paid no attention to the successive charges which were brought against him m_noirtier_de_villefort who examined him attentively and who no doubt practiced upon him all the psychological studies he was accustomed to use in vain endeavored to make him lower his eye notwithstanding the depth and profundity of his gaze at length the reading of the indictment was ended accused said the president your name and surname m_andrea_cavalcanti arose excuse me mr president he said in a clear voice but i see you are going to adopt a course of questions through which i cannot follow you
i have an idea which i will explain by and by of making an exception to the usual form of accusation allow me then if you please to answer in different order or i will not do so at all the astonished president looked at the jury who in turn looked at m_noirtier_de_villefort the whole assembly manifested great surprise but m_andrea_cavalcanti appeared quite unmoved your age said the president will you answer that question â i will answer that question as well as the rest mr president but in its turn â your age repeated the president i am twenty one year old or rather i shall be in a few day as i was born the night of the 27th of september 1817 m_noirtier_de_villefort who was busy taking down some notes raised his head at the mention of this date where were you born continued the president at auteuil near paris m_noirtier_de_villefort a second time raised his head looked at m_benedetto as if he had been gazing at the head of medusa and became livid as for m_benedetto he gracefully wiped his lip with a fine cambric pocket handkerchief your profession â first i was a forger answered m_andrea_cavalcanti as calmly as possible then i became a thief and lately have become an assassin a murmur or rather storm of indignation burst from all part of the assembly the judges themselves appeared to be stupefied and the jury manifested tokens of disgust for a cynicism so unexpected in a man of fashion m_noirtier_de_villefort pressed his hand upon his brow which at first pale had become red and burning then he suddenly arose and looked around as though he had lost his sensesâ he wanted air 50183m are
you looking for anything mr procureur asked m_benedetto with his most ingratiating smile m_noirtier_de_villefort answered nothing but sat or rather threw himself down again upon his chair and now prisoner will you consent to tell your name said the president the brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and classified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the court both in the name of morality and for the respect due to humanity you appear to consider this a point of honor and it may be for this reason that you have delayed acknowledging your name you wished it to be preceded by all these titles â_it is quite wonderful mr president how entirely you have read my thoughts said m_benedetto in his softest voice and most polite manner this is indeed the reason why i begged you to alter the order of the questions the public astonishment had reached its height there was no longer any deceit or bravado in the manner of the accused the audience felt that a startling revelation was to follow this ominous prelude well said the president your name â i cannot tell you my name since i do not know it but i know my fatherâ and can tell it to you a painful giddiness overwhelmed m_noirtier_de_villefort great drops of acrid sweat fell from his face upon the paper which he held in his convulsed hand repeat your fatherâ name said the president not a whisper not a breath was heard in that vast assembly everyone waited anxiously my father is kingâ attorney replied m_andrea_cavalcanti calmly 50179m kingâ s
attorney said the president stupefied and without noticing the agitation which spread over the face of m_noirtier_de_villefort kingâ attorney â_yes and if you wish to know his name i will tell it he is named m_noirtier_de_villefort the explosion which had been so long restrained from a feeling of respect to the court of justice now burst forth like thunder from the breasts of all present the court itself did not seek to restrain the feelings of the audience the exclamations the insults addressed to m_benedetto who remained perfectly unconcerned the energetic gestures the movement of the gendarmes the sneers of the scum of the crowd always sure to rise to the surface in case of any disturbanceâ all this lasted five minute before the door keepers and magistrates were able to restore silence in the midst of this tumult the voice of thepresident was heard to exclaim are you playing with justice accused and do you dare set your fellow citizens an example of disorder which even in these time has never been equalled several person hurried up to m_noirtier_de_villefort who sat half bowed over in his chair offering him consolation encouragement and protestations of zeal and sympathy order was re established in the hall except that a few people still moved about and whispered to one another a lady it was said had just fainted they had supplied her with a smelling bottle and she had recovered during the scene of tumult m_andrea_cavalcanti had turned his smiling face towards the assembly then leaning with one hand on the oaken rail of the dock in the most graceful attitude possible he said gentlemen i assure you i had no idea of insulting the court or of making a useless disturbance in the presence of this honorable assembly
they ask my age i tell it they ask where i was born i answer they ask my name i cannot give it since my parents abandoned me but though i cannot give my own name not possessing one i can tell them my fatherâ now i repeat my father is named m_noirtier_de_villefort and i am ready to prove it there was an energy a conviction and a sincerity in the manner of the young man which silenced the tumult all eye were turned for a moment towards the procureur who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt had changed him into a corpse gentlemen said m_andrea_cavalcanti commanding silence by his voice and manner i owe you the proofs and explanations of what i have said â but said the irritated president you called yourself m_benedetto declared yourself an orphan and claimed corsica as your country â i said anything i pleased in order that the solemn declaration i have just made should not be withheld which otherwise would certainly have been the case i now repeat that i was born at auteuil on the night of the 27th of september 1817 and that i am the son of the procureur m_noirtier_de_villefort do you wish for any further details i will give them i was born in no 28 rue de la fontaine in a room hung with red damask my father took me in his arm telling my mother i was dead wrapped me in a napkin marked with an and an and carried me into a garden where he buried me alive a shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of the prisoner increased in proportion to the terror of m_noirtier_de_villefort but
how have you become acquainted with all these details asked the president i will tell you mr president a man who had sworn vengeance against my father and had long watched his opportunity to kill him had introduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried me he was concealed in a thicket he saw my father bury something in the ground and stabbed him then thinking the deposit might contain some treasure he turned up the ground and found me still living the man carried me to the foundling asylum where i was registered under the number 37 three month afterwards a woman travelled from rogliano to paris to fetch me and having claimed me as her son carried me away thus you see though born in paris i was brought up in corsica there was a momentâ silence during which one could have fancied the hall empty so profound was the stillness proceed said the president certainly i might have lived happily amongst those good people who adored me but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues which my adopted mother endeavored to instil into my heart i increased in wickedness till i committed crime one day when i cursed providence for making me so wicked and ordaining me to such a fate my adopted father said to me do not blaspheme unhappy child the crime is that of your father not yours of your father who consigned you to hell if you died and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive after that i ceased to blaspheme but i cursed my father that is why i have uttered the word for which you blame me that is why i have filled this whole assembly with horror
if i have committed an additional crime punish me but if you will allow that ever since the day of my birth my fate has been sad bitter and lamentable then pity me â but your mother asked the president my mother thought me dead she is not guilty i did not even wish to know her name nor do i know it just then a piercing cry ending in a sob burst from the centre of the crowd who encircled the lady who had before fainted and who now fell into a violent fit of hysterics she was carried out of the hall the thick veil which concealed her face dropped off and madame mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was recognized notwithstanding his shattered nerves the ringing sensation in his ears and the madness which turned his brain m_noirtier_de_villefort rose as he perceived her the proofs the proofs said the president remember this tissue of horrors must be supported by the clearest proofs â the proofs said m_benedetto laughing do you want proofs â_yes â well then look at m_noirtier_de_villefort and then ask me for proofs everyone turned towards the procureur who unable to bear the universal gaze now riveted on him alone advanced staggering into the midst of the tribunal with his hair dishevelled and his face indented with the mark of his nails the whole assembly uttered a long murmur of astonishment father said m_benedetto i am asked for proofs do you wish me to give them â no no it is useless stammered m_noirtier_de_villefort in a hoarse voice no it is useless â how useless cried the president what do you mean â i mean that i feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly weight which crushes me gentlemen i know i am in the hand of an avenging god
we need no proofs everything relating to this young man is true a dull gloomy silence like that which precedes some awful phenomenon of nature pervaded the assembly who shuddered in dismay what m_noirtier_de_villefort cried the president do you yield to an hallucination what are you no longer in possession of your senses this strange unexpected terrible accusation has disordered your reason come recover the procureur dropped his head his teeth chattered like those of a man under a violent attack of fever and yet he was deadly pale i am in possession of all my senses sir he said my body alone suffers as you may suppose i acknowledge myself guilty of all the young man has brought against me and from this hour hold myself under the authority of the procureur who will succeed me and as he spoke these word with a hoarse choking voice he staggered towards the door which was mechanically opened by a door keeper the whole assembly were dumb with astonishment at the revelation and confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that which had been expected during the last fortnight by the parisian world well said m_beauchamp let them now say that drama is unnatural â ma foi said baron_de_chã_teau_renaud i would rather end my career like de viscount_albert_de_morcerf a pistol shot seems quite delightful compared with this catastrophe â and moreover it kills said m_beauchamp and to think that i had an idea of marrying his daughter said m_lucien_debray she did well to die poor girl â the sitting is adjourned gentlemen said the president fresh inquiries will be made and the case will be tried next session by another magistrate
as for m_andrea_cavalcanti who was calm and more interesting than ever he left the hall escorted by gendarmes who involuntarily paid him some attention well what do you think of this my fine fellow asked m_lucien_debray of the sergeant at arm slipping a louis_xviii into his hand there will be extenuating circumstances he replied chapter 111 expiation notwithstanding the density of the crowd m_noirtier_de_villefort saw it open before him there is something so awe inspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst time the first emotion of a crowd has generally been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe many people have been assassinated in a tumult but even criminals have rarely been insulted during trial thus m_noirtier_de_villefort passed through the mass of spectators and officers of the palais and withdrew though he had acknowledged his guilt he was protected by his grief there are some situations which man understand by instinct but which reason is powerless to explain in such cases the greatest poet is he who gives utterance to the most natural and vehement outburst of sorrow those who hear the bitter cry are as much impressed as if they listened to an entire poem and when the sufferer is sincere they are right in regarding his outburst as sublime it would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which m_noirtier_de_villefort left the palais every pulse beat with feverish excitement every nerve was strained every vein swollen and every part of his body seemed to suffer distinctly from the rest thus multiplying his agony a thousand fold he made his way along the corridors through force of habit he threw aside his magisterial robe not out of deference to etiquette but because it was an unbearable burden a veritable garb of nessus insatiate in torture
having staggered as far as the rue dauphine he perceived his carriage awoke his sleeping coachman by opening the door himself threw himself on the cushions and pointed towards the faubourg saint honorã the carriage drove on all the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him he could not foresee the consequences he could not contemplate the future with the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely face a contingency already familiar god was still in his heart god he murmured not knowing what he said â godâ god behind the event that had overwhelmed him he saw the hand of god the carriage rolled rapidly onward m_noirtier_de_villefort while turning restlessly on the cushions felt something press against him he put out his hand to remove the object it was a fan which madame m_noirtier_de_villefort had left in the carriage this fan awakened a recollection which darted through his mind like lightning he thought of his wife 50189 â_oh he exclaimed as though a red hot iron were piercing his heart during the last hour his own crime had alone been presented to his mind now another object not less terrible suddenly presented itself his wife he had just acted the inexorable judge with her he had condemned her to death and she crushed by remorse struck with terror covered with the shame inspired by the eloquence of his irreproachable virtue she a poor weak woman without help or the power of defending herself against his absolute and supreme will she might at that very moment perhaps be preparing to die
an hour had elapsed since her condemnation at that moment doubtless she was recalling all her crimes to her memory she was asking pardon for her sins perhaps she was even writing a letter imploring forgiveness from her virtuous husbandâ a forgiveness she was purchasing with her death m_noirtier_de_villefort again groaned with anguish and despair ah he exclaimed that woman became criminal only from associating with me i carried the infection of crime with me and she has caught it as she would the typhus fever the cholera the plague and yet i have punished herâ i have dared to tell herâ i haveâ repent and die but no she must not die she shall live and with me we will flee from paris and go as far as the earth reaches i told her of the scaffold oh heavens i forgot that it awaits me also how could i pronounce that word yes we will fly i will confess all to her i will tell her daily that i also have committed a crime â_oh what an allianceâ the tiger and the serpent worthy wife of such as i am she must live that my infamy may diminish hers and m_noirtier_de_villefort dashed open the window in front of the carriage faster faster he cried in a tone which electrified the coachman the horse impelled by fear flew towards the house_of_peers â_yes yes repeated m_noirtier_de_villefort as he approached his homeâ â_yes that woman must live she must repent and educate my son the sole survivor with the exception of the indestructible old man of the wreck of my house_of_peers she loves him it was for his sake she has committed these crimes we ought never to despair of softening the heart of a mother who loves her child
she will repent and no one will know that she has been guilty the events which have taken place in my house_of_peers though they now occupy the public mind will be forgotten in time or if indeed a few enemies should persist in remembering them why then i will add them to my list of crimes what will it signify if one two or three more are added my wife and child shall escape from this gulf carrying treasures with them she will live and may yet be happy since her child in whom all her love is centred will be with her i shall have performed a good action and my heart will be lighter and the procureur breathed more freely than he had done for some time 50191 the carriage stopped at the door of the house_of_peers m_noirtier_de_villefort leaped out of the carriage and saw that his servant were surprised at his early return he could read no other expression on their features neither of them spoke to him they merely stood aside to let him pass by as usual nothing more as he passed by noirtierâ room he perceived two figures through the half open door but he experienced no curiosity to know who was visiting his father anxiety carried him on further come he said as he ascended the stairs leading to his wifeâ room nothing is changed here he then closed the door of the landing no one must disturb us he said i must speak freely to her accuse myself and sayâ he approached the door touched the crystal handle which yielded to his hand not locked he cried that is well
and he entered the little room in which edward slept for though the child went to school during the day his mother could not allow him to be separated from her at night with a single glance villefortâ eye ran through the room not here he said doubtless she is in her bedroom he rushed towards the door found it bolted and stopped shuddering hã loã se he cried he fancied he heard the sound of a piece of furniture being removed hã loã se he repeated who is there answered the voice of her he sought he thought that voice more feeble than usual open the door cried m_noirtier_de_villefort open it is i but notwithstanding this request notwithstanding the tone of anguish in which it was uttered the door remained closed m_noirtier_de_villefort burst it open with a violent blow at the entrance of the room which led to her boudoir madame m_noirtier_de_villefort was standing erect pale her features contracted and her eye glaring horribly hã loã se hã loã se he said what is the matter speak the young woman extended her stiff white hand towards him â_it is done monsieur_albert she said with a rattling noise which seemed to tear her throat what more do you want and she fell full length on the floor m_noirtier_de_villefort ran to her and seized her hand which convulsively clasped a crystal bottle with a golden stopper madame m_noirtier_de_villefort was dead m_noirtier_de_villefort maddened with horror stepped back to the threshhold of the door fixing his eye on the corpse my son he exclaimed suddenly where is my son edward edward and he rushed out of the room still crying edward edward the name was pronounced in such a tone of anguish that the servant ran up
â where is my son asked m_noirtier_de_villefort let him be removed from the house_of_peers that he may not seeâ â master edward is not downstairs sir replied the valet then he must be playing in the garden go and see 50193m no sir madame m_noirtier_de_villefort sent for him half an hour ago he went into her room and has not been downstairs since a cold perspiration burst out on villefortâ brow his legs trembled and his thoughts flew about madly in his brain like the wheels of a disordered watch in madame de villefortâ room he murmured and slowly returned with one hand wiping his forehead and with the other supporting himself against the wall to enter the room he must again see the body of his unfortunate wife to call edward he must reawaken the echo of that room which now appeared like a sepulchre to speak seemed like violating the silence of the tomb his tongue was paralyzed in his mouth edward he stammeredâ edward the child did not answer where then could he be if he had entered his motherâ room and not since returned he stepped forward the corpse of madame m_noirtier_de_villefort was stretched across the doorway leading to the room in which edward must be those glaring eye seemed to watch over the threshold and the lip bore the stamp of a terrible and mysterious irony through the open door was visible a portion of the boudoir containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch m_noirtier_de_villefort stepped forward two or three paces and beheld his child lyingâ no doubt asleepâ on the sofa the unhappy man uttered an exclamation of joy a ray of light seemed to penetrate the abyss of despair and darkness
he had only to step over the corpse enter the boudoir take the child in his arm and flee far far away m_noirtier_de_villefort was no longer the civilized man he was a tiger hurt unto death gnashing his teeth in his wound he no longer feared realities but phantoms he leaped over the corpse as if it had been a burning brazier he took the child in his arm embraced him shook him called him but the child made no response he pressed his burning lip to the cheeks but they were icy cold and pale he felt the stiffened limbs he pressed his hand upon the heart but it no longer beat the child was dead a folded paper fell from edwardâ breast m_noirtier_de_villefort thunderstruck fell upon his knees the child dropped from his arm and rolled on the floor by the side of its mother he picked up the paper and recognizing his wifeâ writing ran his eye rapidly over its contents it ran as follows you know that i was a good mother since it was for my sonâ sake i became criminal a good mother cannot depart without her son m_noirtier_de_villefort could not believe his eye he could not believe his reason he dragged himself towards the childâ body and examined it as a lioness contemplates its dead cub then a piercing cry escaped from his breast and he cried still the hand of god the presence of the two victims alarmed him he could not bear solitude shared only by two corpses until then he had been sustained by rage by his strength of mind by despair by the supreme agony which led the titans to scale the heavens and ajax to defy the gods
he now arose his head bowed beneath the weight of grief and shaking his damp dishevelled hair he who had never felt compassion for anyone determined to seek his father that he might have someone to whom he could relate his misfortunes someone by whose side he might weep 50195m he descended the little staircase with which we are acquainted and entered noirtierâ room the old man appeared to be listening attentively and as affectionately as his infirmities would allow to the abbã_busoni who looked cold and calm as usual m_noirtier_de_villefort perceiving the abbã passed his hand across his brow the past came to him like one of those waves whose wrath foams fiercer than the others he recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at auteuil and then the visit the abbã had himself paid to his house_of_peers on the day of valentineâ death you here sir he exclaimed do you then never appear but to act as an escort to death abbã_busoni turned around and perceiving the excitement depicted on the magistrateâ face the savage lustre of his eye he understood that the revelation had been made at the assizes but beyond this he was ignorant i came to pray over the body of your daughter â and now why are you here â i come to tell you that you have sufficiently repaid your debt and that from this moment i will pray to god to forgive you as i do â good heavens exclaimed m_noirtier_de_villefort stepping back fearfully surely that is not the voice of the abbã_busoni â no the abbã threw off his wig shook his head and his hair no longer confined fell in black masses around his manly face
â it is the face of the count_of_monte_cristo exclaimed the procureur with a haggard expression you are not exactly right procureur you must go farther back â that voice that voice where did i first hear it â you heard it for the first time at marseilles twenty three year ago the day of your marriage with mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars de madame_de_saint_mã_ran refer to your paper â you are not abbã_busoni you are not count_of_monte_cristo oh heavens you are then some secret implacable and mortal enemy i must have wronged you in some way at marseilles oh woe to me â_yes you are now on the right path said the count crossing his arm over his broad chest searchâ search â but what have i done to you exclaimed m_noirtier_de_villefort whose mind was balancing between reason and insanity in that cloud which is neither a dream nor reality what have i done to you tell me then speak â you condemned me to a horrible tedious death you killed my father you deprived me of liberty of love and happiness â who are you then who are you â i am the spectre of a wretch you buried in the dungeons of the chã teau dâ if god gave that spectre the form of the count_of_monte_cristo when he at length issued from his tomb enriched him with gold and diamonds and led him to you â ah i recognize youâ i recognize you exclaimed the kingâ attorney you areâ â i am edmond_dantã_s â you are edmond_dantã_s cried m_noirtier_de_villefort seizing the count by the wrist then come here and up the stairs he dragged count_of_monte_cristo who ignorant of what had happened followed him in astonishment foreseeing some new catastrophe
â there edmond_dantã_s he said pointing to the bodies of his wife and child see are you well avenged count_of_monte_cristo became pale at this horrible sight he felt that he had passed beyond the bounds of vengeance and that he could no longer say god is for and with me with an expression of indescribable anguish he threw himself upon the body of the child reopened its eye felt its pulse and then rushed with him into valentineâ room of which he double locked the door my child cried m_noirtier_de_villefort he carries away the body of my child oh curses woe death to you he tried to follow count_of_monte_cristo but as though in a dream he was transfixed to the spot his eye glared as though they were starting through the sockets he griped the flesh on his chest until his nails were stained with blood the veins of his temples swelled and boiled as though they would burst their narrow boundary and deluge his brain with living fire this lasted several minute until the frightful overturn of reason was accomplished then uttering a loud cry followed by a burst of laughter he rushed down the stairs a quarter of an hour afterwards the door of valentineâ room opened and count_of_monte_cristo reappeared pale with a dull eye and heavy heart all the noble features of that face usually so calm and serene were overcast by grief in his arm he held the child whom no skill had been able to recall to life bending on one knee he placed it reverently by the side of its mother with its head upon her breast
then rising he went out and meeting a servant on the stairs he asked where is m_noirtier_de_villefort the servant instead of answering pointed to the garden count_of_monte_cristo ran down the step and advancing towards the spot designated beheld m_noirtier_de_villefort encircled by his servant with a spade in his hand and digging the earth with fury â_it is not here he cried â_it is not here 50197m and then he moved farther on and began again to dig count_of_monte_cristo approached him and said in a low voice with an expression almost humble sir you have indeed lost a son butâ â m_noirtier_de_villefort interrupted him he had neither listened nor heard â_oh i will find it he cried you may pretend he is not here but i will find him though i dig forever count_of_monte_cristo drew back in horror â_oh he said he is mad and as though he feared that the wall of the accursed house_of_peers would crumble around him he rushed into the street for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had done â_oh enough of this enough of this he cried let me save the last on entering his house_of_peers he met m_maximilian_morrel who wandered about like a ghost awaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the tomb prepare yourself m_maximilian_morrel he said with a smile we leave paris tomorrow â have you nothing more to do there asked m_maximilian_morrel no replied count_of_monte_cristo god grant i may not have done too much already the next day they indeed left accompanied only by monsieur_baptistin haydã_e had taken away ali_pasha_of_yanina and monsieur_bertuccio remained with m_noirtier_de_villefort chapter 112 the departure the recent events formed the theme of conversation throughout all paris
emmanuel and his wife conversed with natural astonishment in their little apartment in the rue meslay upon the three successive sudden and most unexpected catastrophes of viscount_albert_de_morcerf mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and m_noirtier_de_villefort m_maximilian_morrel who was paying them a visit listened to their conversation or rather was present at it plunged in his accustomed state of apathy indeed said mademoiselle_julie might we not almost fancy m_emmanuel that those people so rich so happy but yesterday had forgotten in their prosperity that an evil geniusâ like the wicked fairies in perraultâ stories who present themselves unbidden at a wedding or baptismâ hovered over them and appeared all at once to revenge himself for their fatal neglect â what a dire misfortune said m_emmanuel thinking of viscount_albert_de_morcerf and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars what dreadful sufferings said mademoiselle_julie remembering mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort but whom with a delicacy natural to woman she did not name before her brother if the supreme being has directed the fatal blow said m_emmanuel â_it must be that he in his great goodness has perceived nothing in the past life of these people to merit mitigation of their awful punishment â do you not form a very rash judgment m_emmanuel said mademoiselle_julie when my father with a pistol in his hand was once on the point of committing suicide had anyone then said this man deserves his misery would not that person have been deceived â_yes but your father was not allowed to fall a being was commissioned to arrest the fatal hand of death about to descend on him m_emmanuel had scarcely uttered these word when the sound of the bell was heard the well known signal given by the porter that a visitor had arrived nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the count_of_monte_cristo appeared on the threshold
the young people uttered a cry of joy while m_maximilian_morrel raised his head but let it fall again immediately 50201m m_maximilian_morrel said the count without appearing to notice the different impressions which his presence produced on the little circle i come to seek you â to seek me repeated m_maximilian_morrel as if awakening from a dream â_yes said count_of_monte_cristo has it not been agreed that i should take you with me and did i not tell you yesterday to prepare for departure â i am ready said m_maximilian_morrel i came expressly to wish them farewell â whither are you going count asked mademoiselle_julie in the first instance to marseilles madame â to marseilles exclaimed the young couple â_yes and i take your brother with me â_oh count said mademoiselle_julie will you restore him to us cured of his melancholy m_maximilian_morrel turned away to conceal the confusion of his countenance you perceive then that he is not happy said the count â_yes replied the young woman and fear much that he finds our home but a dull one â i will undertake to divert him replied the count i am ready to accompany you sir said m_maximilian_morrel adieu my kind friend emmanuelâ julieâ farewell â how farewell exclaimed mademoiselle_julie do you leave us thus so suddenly without any preparations for your journey without even a passport â needless delays but increase the grief of parting said count_of_monte_cristo and m_maximilian_morrel has doubtless provided himself with everything requisite at least i advised him to do so â i have a passport and my clothes are ready packed said m_maximilian_morrel in his tranquil but mournful manner good said count_of_monte_cristo smiling in these prompt arrangements we recognize the order of a well disciplined soldier â and you leave us said mademoiselle_julie at a momentâ warning
you do not give us a dayâ no not even an hour before your departure â my carriage is at the door madame and i must be in rome in five day â but does m_maximilian_morrel go to rome exclaimed m_emmanuel i am going wherever it may please the count to take me said m_maximilian_morrel with a smile full of grief i am under his order for the next month â_oh heavens how strangely he expresses himself count said mademoiselle_julie m_maximilian_morrel goes with me said the count in his kindest and most persuasive manner therefore do not make yourself uneasy on your brotherâ account â once more farewell my dear sister m_emmanuel adieu m_maximilian_morrel repeated his carelessness and indifference touch me to the heart said mademoiselle_julie â_oh m_maximilian_morrel maximilian you are certainly concealing something from us â pshaw said count_of_monte_cristo you will see him return to you gay smiling and joyful m_maximilian_morrel cast a look of disdain almost of anger on the count we must leave you said count_of_monte_cristo 50203m before you quit us count said mademoiselle_julie will you permit us to express to you all that the other dayâ â madame interrupted the count taking her two hand in his all that you could say in word would never express what i read in your eye the thoughts of your heart are fully understood by mine like benefactors in romances i should have left you without seeing you again but that would have been a virtue beyond my strength because i am a weak and vain man fond of the tender kind and thankful glances of my fellow creatures
on the eve of departure i carry my egotism so far as to say do not forget me my kind friend for probably you will never see me again â never see you again exclaimed m_emmanuel while two large tears rolled down julieâ cheeks never behold you again it is not a man then but some angel that leaves us and this angel is on the point of returning to heaven after having appeared on earth to do good â say not so quickly returned monte cristoâ say not so my friend angels never err celestial beings remain where they wish to be fate is not more powerful than they it is they who on the contrary overcome fate no m_emmanuel i am but a man and your admiration is as unmerited as your word are sacrilegious and pressing his lip on the hand of mademoiselle_julie who rushed into his arm he extended his other hand to m_emmanuel then tearing himself from this abode of peace and happiness he made a sign to m_maximilian_morrel who followed him passively with the indifference which had been perceptible in him ever since the death of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort had so stunned him restore my brother to peace and happiness whispered mademoiselle_julie to count_of_monte_cristo and the count pressed her hand in reply as he had done eleven year before on the staircase leading to morrelâ study you still confide then in sinbad the sailor asked he smiling â_oh yes was the ready answer well then sleep in peace and put your trust in the lord as we have before said the post chaise was waiting four powerful horse were already pawing the ground with impatience while ali_pasha_of_yanina apparently just arrived from a long walk was standing at the foot of the step his face bathed in perspiration
â well asked the count in arabic have you been to see the old man ali_pasha_of_yanina made a sign in the affirmative and have you placed the letter before him as i ordered you to do the slave respectfully signalized that he had and what did he say or rather do ali_pasha_of_yanina placed himself in the light so that his master might see him distinctly and then imitating in his intelligent manner the countenance of the old man he closed his eye as m_noirtier_de_villefort was in the custom of doing when saying â_yes â good he accepts said count_of_monte_cristo now let us go 50205m these word had scarcely escaped him when the carriage was on its way and the foot of the horse struck a shower of sparks from the pavement m_maximilian_morrel settled himself in his corner without uttering a word half an hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly the count had just pulled the silken check string which was fastened to aliâ finger the nubian immediately descended and opened the carriage door it was a lovely starlight nightâ they had just reached the top of the hill villejuif from whence paris appears like a sombre sea tossing its millions of phosphoric waves into lightâ waves indeed more noisy more passionate more changeable more furious more greedy than those of the tempestuous ocean waves which never rest as those of the sea sometimes do waves ever dashing ever foaming ever ingulfing what falls within their grasp the count stood alone and at a sign from his hand the carriage went on for a short distance with folded arm he gazed for some time upon the great city
when he had fixed his piercing look on this modern babylon which equally engages the contemplation of the religious enthusiast the materialist and the scoffer â great city murmured he inclining his head and joining his hand as if in prayer less than six month have elapsed since first i entered thy gates i believe that the spirit of god led my step to thee and that he also enables me to quit thee in triumph the secret cause of my presence within thy wall i have confided alone to him who only has had the power to read my heart god only knows that i retire from thee without pride or hatred but not without many regrets he only knows that the power confided to me has never been made subservient to my personal good or to any useless cause oh great city it is in thy palpitating bosom that i have found that which i sought like a patient miner i have dug deep into thy very entrails to root out evil thence now my work is accomplished my mission is terminated now thou canst neither afford me pain nor pleasure adieu paris adieu his look wandered over the vast plain like that of some genius of the night he passed his hand over his brow got into the carriage the door was closed on him and the vehicle quickly disappeared down the other side of the hill in a whirlwind of dust and noise ten leagues were passed and not a single word was uttered m_maximilian_morrel was dreaming and count_of_monte_cristo was looking at the dreamer m_maximilian_morrel said the count to him at length do you repent having followed me â no count but to leave parisâ â if
i thought happiness might await you in paris m_maximilian_morrel i would have left you there â mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort reposes within the wall of paris and to leave paris is like losing her a second time â m_maximilian_morrel said the count the friend that we have lost do not repose in the bosom of the earth but are buried deep in our heart and it has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by them i have two friend who in this way never depart from me the one who gave me being and the other who conferred knowledge and intelligence on me their spirits live in me i consult them when doubtful and if i ever do any good it is due to their beneficent counsels listen to the voice of your heart m_maximilian_morrel and ask it whether you ought to preserve this melancholy exterior towards me â my friend said m_maximilian_morrel the voice of my heart is very sorrowful and promises me nothing but misfortune â_it is the way of weakened mind to see everything through a black cloud the soul forms its own horizons your soul is darkened and consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising â that may possibly be true said m_maximilian_morrel and he again subsided into his thoughtful mood the journey was performed with that marvellous rapidity which the unlimited power of the count ever commanded towns fled from them like shadows on their path and trees shaken by the first winds of autumn seemed like giants madly rushing on to meet them and retreating as rapidly when once reached the following morning they arrived at chã lons where the countâ steamboat waited for them without the loss of an instant the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers embarked without delay
the boat was built for speed her two paddle wheels were like two wings with which she skimmed the water like a bird m_maximilian_morrel was not insensible to that sensation of delight which is generally experienced in passing rapidly through the air and the wind which occasionally raised the hair from his forehead seemed on the point of dispelling momentarily the clouds collected there as the distance increased between the travellers and paris almost superhuman serenity appeared to surround the count he might have been taken for an exile about to revisit his native land ere long marseilles presented herself to view marseilles white fervid full of life and energy marseilles the younger sister of tyre and carthage the successor to them in the empire of the mediterranean marseilles old yet always young powerful memories were stirred within them by the sight of the round tower fort saint nicolas the city hall designed by puget 28 the port with its brick quays where they had both played in childhood and it was with one accord that they stopped on the canebiã re a vessel was setting sail for algiers on board of which the bustle usually attending departure prevailed the passengers and their relations crowded on the deck friend taking a tender but sorrowful leave of each other some weeping others noisy in their grief the whole forming a spectacle that might be exciting even to those who witnessed similar sights daily but which had no power to disturb the current of thought that had taken possession of the mind of m_maximilian_morrel from the moment he had set foot on the broad pavement of the quay
â here said he leaning heavily on the arm of count_of_monte_cristo â here is the spot where my father stopped when the pharaon entered the port it was here that the good old man whom you saved from death and dishonor threw himself into my arm i yet feel his warm tears on my face and his were not the only tears shed for many who witnessed our meeting wept also count_of_monte_cristo gently smiled and said â i was there at the same time pointing to the corner of a street as he spoke and in the very direction he indicated a groan expressive of bitter grief was heard and a woman was seen waving her hand to a passenger on board the vessel about to sail count_of_monte_cristo looked at her with an emotion that must have been remarked by m_maximilian_morrel had not his eye been fixed on the vessel â_oh heavens exclaimed m_maximilian_morrel i do not deceive myselfâ that young man who is waving his hat that youth in the uniform of a lieutenant is monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf â_yes said count_of_monte_cristo i recognized him â how so you were looking the other way 50209m the count smiled as he was in the habit of doing when he did not want to make any reply and he again turned towards the veiled woman who soon disappeared at the corner of the street turning to his friend dear m_maximilian_morrel said the count have you nothing to do in this land â i have to weep over the grave of my father replied m_maximilian_morrel in a broken voice well then go wait for me there and i will soon join
you â you leave me then â_yes i also have a pious visit to pay m_maximilian_morrel allowed his hand to fall into that which the count extended to him then with an inexpressibly sorrowful inclination of the head he quitted the count and bent his step to the east of the city count_of_monte_cristo remained on the same spot until m_maximilian_morrel was out of sight he then walked slowly towards the allã es de meilhan to seek out a small house_of_peers with which our readers were made familiar at the beginning of this story it yet stood under the shade of the fine avenue of lime trees which forms one of the most frequent walks of the idlers of marseilles covered by an immense vine which spreads its aged and blackened branches over the stone front burnt yellow by the ardent sun of the south two stone step worn away by the friction of many foot led to the door which was made of three planks the door had never been painted or varnished so great cracks yawned in it during the dry season to close again when the rains came on the house_of_peers with all its crumbling antiquity and apparent misery was yet cheerful and picturesque and was the same that old edmond_dantã_s formerly inhabitedâ the only difference being that the old man occupied merely the garret while the whole house_of_peers was now placed at the command of mercã_dã_s by the count the woman whom the count had seen leave the ship with so much regret entered this house_of_peers she had scarcely closed the door after her when count_of_monte_cristo appeared at the corner of a street so that he found and lost her again almost at the same instant
the worn out step were old acquaintances of his he knew better than anyone else how to open that weather beaten door with the large headed nail which served to raise the latch within he entered without knocking or giving any other intimation of his presence as if he had been a friend or the master of the place at the end of a passage paved with bricks was a little garden bathed in sunshine and rich in warmth and light in this garden mercã_dã_s had found at the place indicated by the count the sum of money which he through a sense of delicacy had described as having been placed there twenty four year previously the trees of the garden were easily seen from the step of the street door count_of_monte_cristo on stepping into the house_of_peers heard a sigh that was almost a deep sob he looked in the direction whence it came and there under an arbor of virginia jessamine 29 with its thick foliage and beautiful long purple flowers he saw mercã_dã_s seated with her head bowed and weeping bitterly she had raised her veil and with her face hidden by her hand was giving free scope to the sighs and tears which had been so long restrained by the presence of her son count_of_monte_cristo advanced a few step which were heard on the gravel mercã_dã_s raised her head and uttered a cry of terror on beholding a man before her 50211m madame said the count â_it is no longer in my power to restore you to happiness but i offer you consolation will you deign to accept it as coming from a friend â i am indeed most wretched replied mercã_dã_s alone in the world i had but my son and he has left me â he
possesses a noble heart madame replied the count and he has acted rightly he feels that every man owes a tribute to his country some contribute their talents others their industry these devote their blood those their nightly labors to the same cause had he remained with you his life must have become a hateful burden nor would he have participated in your griefs he will increase in strength and honor by struggling with adversity which he will convert into prosperity leave him to build up the future for you and i venture to say you will confide it to safe hand â_oh replied the wretched woman mournfully shaking her head the prosperity of which you speak and which from the bottom of my heart i pray god in his mercy to grant him i can never enjoy the bitter cup of adversity has been drained by me to the very dregs and i feel that the grave is not far distant you have acted kindly count in bringing me back to the place where i have enjoyed so much bliss i ought to meet death on the same spot where happiness was once all my own â alas said count_of_monte_cristo your word sear and embitter my heart the more so as you have every reason to hate me i have been the cause of all your misfortunes but why do you pity instead of blaming me you render me still more unhappyâ â hate you blame youâ you edmond_dantã_s hate reproach the man that has spared my sonâ life for was it not your fatal and sanguinary intention to destroy that son of whom de viscount_albert_de_morcerf was so proud oh look at me closely and discover if you can even the semblance of a reproach in me
the count looked up and fixed his eye on mercã_dã_s who arose partly from her seat and extended both her hand towards him â_oh look at me continued she with a feeling of profound melancholy my eye no longer dazzle by their brilliancy for the time has long fled since i used to smile on edmond_dantã_s who anxiously looked out for me from the window of yonder garret then inhabited by his old father year of grief have created an abyss between those day and the present i neither reproach you nor hate you my friend oh no edmond_dantã_s it is myself that i blame myself that i hate oh miserable creature that i am cried she clasping her hand and raising her eye to heaven i once possessed piety innocence and love the three ingredients of the happiness of angels and now what am i count_of_monte_cristo approached her and silently took her hand no said she withdrawing it gentlyâ no my friend touch me not you have spared me yet of all those who have fallen under your vengeance i was the most guilty they were influenced by hatred by avarice and by self love but i was base and for want of courage acted against my judgment nay do not press my hand edmond_dantã_s you are thinking i am sure of some kind speech to console me but do not utter it to me reserve it for others more worthy of your kindness seeâ and she exposed her face completely to view â see misfortune has silvered my hair my eye have shed so many tears that they are encircled by a rim of purple and my brow is wrinkled
you edmond_dantã_s on the contrary you are still young handsome dignified it is because you have had faith because you have had strength because you have had trust in god and god has sustained you but as for me i have been a coward i have denied god and he has abandoned me 50213m mercã_dã_s burst into tears her womanâ heart was breaking under its load of memories count_of_monte_cristo took her hand and imprinted a kiss on it but she herself felt that it was a kiss of no greater warmth than he would have bestowed on the hand of some marble statue of a saint â_it often happens continued she that a first fault destroys the prospects of a whole life i believed you dead why did i survive you what good has it done me to mourn for you eternally in the secret recesses of my heart only to make a woman of thirty nine look like a woman of fifty why having recognized you and i the only one to do soâ why was i able to save my son alone ought i not also to have rescued the man that i had accepted for a husband guilty though he were yet i let him die what do i say oh merciful heavens was i not accessory to his death by my supine insensibility by my contempt for him not remembering or not willing to remember that it was for my sake he had become a traitor and a perjurer in what am i benefited by accompanying my son so far since i now abandon him and allow him to depart alone to the baneful climate of africa
oh i have been base cowardly i tell you i have abjured my affections and like all renegades i am of evil omen to those who surround me â no mercã_dã_s said count_of_monte_cristo no you judge yourself with too much severity you are a noble minded woman and it was your grief that disarmed me still i was but an agent led on by an invisible and offended deity who chose not to withhold the fatal blow that i was destined to hurl i take that god to witness at whose foot i have prostrated myself daily for the last ten year that i would have sacrificed my life to you and with my life the projects that were indissolubly linked with it butâ and i say it with some pride mercã dã sâ god needed me and i lived examine the past and the present and endeavor to dive into futurity and then say whether i am not a divine instrument the most dreadful misfortunes the most frightful sufferings the abandonment of all those who loved me the persecution of those who did not know me formed the trials of my youth when suddenly from captivity solitude misery i was restored to light and liberty and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant so unbounded so unheard of that i must have been blind not to be conscious that god had endowed me with it to work out his own great designs from that time i looked upon this fortune as something confided to me for a particular purpose not a thought was given to a life which you once mercã_dã_s had the power to render blissful not one hour of peaceful calm was mine but i felt myself driven on like an exterminating angel
like adventurous captains about to embark on some enterprise full of danger i laid in my provisions i loaded my weapons i collected every means of attack and defence i inured my body to the most violent exercises my soul to the bitterest trials i taught my arm to slay my eye to behold excruciating sufferings and my mouth to smile at the most horrid spectacles good natured confiding and forgiving as i had been i became revengeful cunning and wicked or rather immovable as fate then i launched out into the path that was opened to me i overcame every obstacle and reached the goal but woe to those who stood in my pathway 50215m enough said mercã_dã_s enough edmond_dantã_s believe me that she who alone recognized you has been the only one to comprehend you and had she crossed your path and you had crushed her like glass still edmond_dantã_s still she must have admired you like the gulf between me and the past there is an abyss between you edmond_dantã_s and the rest of mankind and i tell you freely that the comparison i draw between you and other man will ever be one of my greatest tortures no there is nothing in the world to resemble you in worth and goodness but we must say farewell edmond_dantã_s and let us part â before i leave you mercã_dã_s have you no request to make said the count i desire but one thing in this world edmond_dantã_s the happiness of my son â pray to the almighty to spare his life and i will take upon myself to promote his happiness â thank you edmond_dantã_s â but have you no request to make for yourself mercã_dã_s â for myself i want nothing i live as it were between two graves
one is that of edmond_dantã_s lost to me long long since he had my love that word ill becomes my faded lip now but it is a memory dear to my heart and one that i would not lose for all that the world contains the other grave is that of the man who met his death from the hand of edmond_dantã_s i approve of the deed but i must pray for the dead â your son shall be happy mercã_dã_s repeated the count then i shall enjoy as much happiness as this world can possibly confer â but what are your intentions mercã_dã_s smiled sadly to say that i shall live here like the mercã_dã_s of other time gaining my bread by labor would not be true nor would you believe me i have no longer the strength to do anything but to spend my day in prayer however i shall have no occasion to work for the little sum of money buried by you and which i found in the place you mentioned will be sufficient to maintain me rumor will probably be busy respecting me my occupations my manner of livingâ that will signify but little that concerns god you and myself â mercã_dã_s said the count i do not say it to blame you but you made an unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the fortune amassed by de viscount_albert_de_morcerf half of it at least by right belonged to you in virtue of your vigilance and economy â i perceive what you are intending to propose to me but i cannot accept it edmondâ my son would not permit it â nothing shall be done without the full approbation of monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf i will make myself acquainted with his intentions and will submit to them
but if he be willing to accept my offers will you oppose them â you well know edmond_dantã_s that i am no longer a reasoning creature i have no will unless it be the will never to decide i have been so overwhelmed by the many storms that have broken over my head that i am become passive in the hand of the almighty like a sparrow in the talons of an eagle i live because it is not ordained for me to die if succor be sent to me i will accept it â ah madame said count_of_monte_cristo you should not talk thus it is not so we should evince our resignation to the will of heaven on the contrary we are all free agents â alas exclaimed mercã_dã_s if it were so if i possessed free will but without the power to render that will efficacious it would drive me to despair count_of_monte_cristo dropped his head and shrank from the vehemence of her grief will you not even say you will see me again he asked on the contrary we shall meet again said mercã_dã_s pointing to heaven with solemnity i tell you so to prove to you that i still hope and after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count mercã_dã_s rushed up the stairs and disappeared count_of_monte_cristo slowly left the house_of_peers and turned towards the quay but mercã_dã_s did not witness his departure although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old edmond_dantã_s her eye were straining to see the ship which was carrying her son over the vast sea but still her voice involuntarily murmured softly edmond_dantã_s edmond edmond_dantã_s chapter 113
the past the count departed with a sad heart from the house_of_peers in which he had left mercã_dã_s probably never to behold her again since the death of little edward a great change had taken place in count_of_monte_cristo having reached the summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path he saw an abyss of doubt yawning before him more than this the conversation which had just taken place between mercã_dã_s and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with them a man of the countâ temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common mind but which destroys superior one he thought he must have made an error in his calculations if he now found cause to blame himself i cannot have deceived myself he said i must look upon the past in a false light what he continued can i have been following a false path can the end which i proposed be a mistaken end can one hour have sufficed to prove to an architect that the work upon which he founded all his hopes was an impossible if not a sacrilegious undertaking i cannot reconcile myself to this ideaâ it would madden me the reason why i am now dissatisfied is that i have not a clear appreciation of the past the past like the country through which we walk becomes indistinct as we advance my position is like that of a person wounded in a dream he feels the wound though he cannot recollect when he received it come then thou regenerate man thou extravagant prodigal thou awakened sleeper
thou all powerful visionary thou invincible millionaire once again review thy past life of starvation and wretchedness revisit the scenes where fate and misfortune conducted and where despair received thee too many diamonds too much gold and splendor are now reflected by the mirror in which count_of_monte_cristo seeks to behold edmond_dantã_s hide thy diamonds bury thy gold shroud thy splendor exchange riches for poverty liberty for a prison a living body for a corpse as he thus reasoned count_of_monte_cristo walked down the rue de la caisserie it was the same through which twenty four year ago he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard the house today so smiling and animated were on that night dark mute and closed and yet they were the same murmured count_of_monte_cristo only now it is broad daylight instead of night it is the sun which brightens the place and makes it appear so cheerful he proceeded towards the quay by the rue saint laurent and advanced to the consigne it was the point where he had embarked a pleasure boat with striped awning was going by count_of_monte_cristo called the owner who immediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for a good fare the weather was magnificent and the excursion a treat the sun red and flaming was sinking into the embrace of the welcoming ocean the sea smooth as crystal was now and then disturbed by the leaping of fish which were pursued by some unseen enemy and sought for safety in another element while on the extreme verge of the horizon might be seen the fishermenâ boats white and graceful as the sea gull or the merchant vessels bound for corsica or spain
but notwithstanding the serene sky the gracefully formed boats and the golden light in which the whole scene was bathed the count_of_monte_cristo wrapped in his cloak could think only of this terrible voyage the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory the solitary light burning at the catalans that first sight of the chã teau dâ if which told him whither they were leading him the struggle with the gendarmes when he wished to throw himself overboard his despair when he found himself vanquished and the sensation when the muzzle of the carbine touched his foreheadâ all these were brought before him in vivid and frightful reality like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed edmond_dantã_s clear sky swift flitting boats and brilliant sunshine disappeared the heavens were hung with black and the gigantic structure of the chã teau dâ if seemed like the phantom of a mortal enemy as they reached the shore the count instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat and the owner was obliged to call out in his sweetest tone of voice sir we are at the landing count_of_monte_cristo remembered that on that very spot on the same rock he had been violently dragged by the guards who forced him to ascend the slope at the points of their bayonets the journey had seemed very long to edmond_dantã_s but count_of_monte_cristo found it equally short each stroke of the oar seemed to awaken a new throng of idea which sprang up with the flying spray of the sea 50219m
there had been no prisoners confined in the chã teau dâ if since the revolution of july it was only inhabited by a guard kept there for the prevention of smuggling a concierge waited at the door to exhibit to visitors this monument of curiosity once a scene of terror the count inquired whether any of the ancient jailers were still there but they had all been pensioned or had passed on to some other employment the concierge who attended him had only been there since 1830 he visited his own dungeon he again beheld the dull light vainly endeavoring to penetrate the narrow opening his eye rested upon the spot where had stood his bed since then removed and behind the bed the new stones indicated where the breach made by the abbã_faria had been count_of_monte_cristo felt his limbs tremble he seated himself upon a log of wood are there any stories connected with this prison besides the one relating to the poisoning of mirabeau asked the count are there any traditions respecting these dismal abodes in which it is difficult to believe man can ever have imprisoned their fellow creatures â_yes sir indeed the jailer antoine told me one connected with this very dungeon count_of_monte_cristo shuddered antoine had been his jailer he had almost forgotten his name and face but at the mention of the name he recalled his person as he used to see it the face encircled by a beard wearing the brown jacket the bunch of keys the jingling of which he still seemed to hear the count turned around and fancied he saw him in the corridor rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concierge
â would you like to hear the story sir â_yes relate it said count_of_monte_cristo pressing his hand to his heart to still its violent beatings he felt afraid of hearing his own history this dungeon said the concierge was it appears some time ago occupied by a very dangerous prisoner the more so since he was full of industry another person was confined in the chã teau at the same time but he was not wicked he was only a poor mad priest â ah indeed mad repeated count_of_monte_cristo and what was his mania â he offered millions to anyone who would set him at liberty count_of_monte_cristo raised his eye but he could not see the heavens there was a stone veil between him and the firmament he thought that there had been no less thick a veil before the eye of those to whom abbã_faria offered the treasures could the prisoners see each other he asked â_oh no sir it was expressly forbidden but they eluded the vigilance of the guards and made a passage from one dungeon to the other â and which of them made this passage â_oh it must have been the young man certainly for he was strong and industrious while the abbã was aged and weak besides his mind was too vacillating to allow him to carry out an idea â blind fools murmured the count however be that as it may the young man made a tunnel how or by what means no one knows but he made it and there is the evidence yet remaining of his work do you see it and the man held the torch to the wall 50223m ah yes i see said the count in a voice hoarse from emotion
â the result was that the two man communicated with one another how long they did so nobody knows one day the old man fell ill and died now guess what the young one did â tell me â he carried off the corpse which he placed in his own bed with its face to the wall then he entered the empty dungeon closed the entrance and slipped into the sack which had contained the dead body did you ever hear of such an idea count_of_monte_cristo closed his eye and seemed again to experience all the sensations he had felt when the coarse canvas yet moist with the cold dews of death had touched his face the jailer continued now this was his project he fancied that they buried the dead at the chã teau dâ if and imagining they would not expend much labor on the grave of a prisoner he calculated on raising the earth with his shoulders but unfortunately their arrangements at the chã teau frustrated his projects they never buried the dead they merely attached a heavy cannon ball to the foot and then threw them into the sea this is what was done the young man was thrown from the top of the rock the corpse was found on the bed next day and the whole truth was guessed for the man who performed the office then mentioned what they had not dared to speak of before that at the moment the corpse was thrown into the deep they heard a shriek which was almost immediately stifled by the water in which it disappeared the count breathed with difficulty the cold drops ran down his forehead and his heart was full of anguish
â no he muttered the doubt i felt was but the commencement of forgetfulness but here the wound reopens and the heart again thirsts for vengeance and the prisoner he continued aloud was he ever heard of afterwards â_oh no of course not you can understand that one of two thing must have happened he must either have fallen flat in which case the blow from a height of ninety foot must have killed him instantly or he must have fallen upright and then the weight would have dragged him to the bottom where he remainedâ poor fellow â then you pity him said the count ma foi yes though he was in his own element â what do you mean â the report was that he had been a naval officer who had been confined for plotting with the bonapartists â great is truth muttered the count fire cannot burn nor water drown it thus the poor sailor life in the recollection of those who narrate his history his terrible story is recited in the chimney corner and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit through the air to be swallowed by the deep then the count added aloud was his name ever known â_oh yes but only as no 34 â_oh m_noirtier_de_villefort villefort murmured the count this scene must often have haunted thy sleepless hour â do you wish to see anything more sir said the concierge â_yes especially if you will show me the poor abbã s room â ah no 27 â_yes no 27 repeated the count who seemed to hear the voice of the abbã answering him in those very word through the wall when asked his name come sir â wait said count_of_monte_cristo i wish to take one final glance around this room
â this is fortunate said the guide i have forgotten the other key â go and fetch it â i will leave you the torch sir â no take it away i can see in the dark â why you are like no 34 they said he was so accustomed to darkness that he could see a pin in the darkest corner of his dungeon â he spent fourteen year to arrive at that muttered the count the guide carried away the torch the count had spoken correctly scarcely had a few seconds elapsed ere he saw everything as distinctly as by daylight then he looked around him and really recognized his dungeon â_yes he said there is the stone upon which i used to sit there is the impression made by my shoulders on the wall there is the mark of my blood made when one day i dashed my head against the wall oh those figures how well i remember them i made them one day to calculate the age of my father that i might know whether i should find him still living and that of mercã_dã_s to know if i should find her still free after finishing that calculation i had a minuteâ hope i did not reckon upon hunger and infidelity and a bitter laugh escaped the count he saw in fancy the burial of his father and the marriage of mercã_dã_s on the other side of the dungeon he perceived an inscription the white letter of which were still visible on the green wall â_oh god â he read â preserve my memory â â_oh yes he cried that was my only prayer at last i no longer begged for liberty but memory i dreaded to become mad and forgetful
oh god thou hast preserved my memory i thank thee i thank thee at this moment the light of the torch was reflected on the wall the guide was coming count_of_monte_cristo went to meet him follow me sir and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted him by a subterraneous passage to another entrance there again count_of_monte_cristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts the first thing that met his eye was the meridian drawn by the abbã on the wall by which he calculated the time then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had died the sight of this instead of exciting the anguish experienced by the count in the dungeon filled his heart with a soft and grateful sentiment and tears fell from his eye this is where the mad abbã was kept sir and that is where the young man entered and the guide pointed to the opening which had remained unclosed from the appearance of the stone he continued a learned gentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated together for ten year poor thing those must have been ten weary year edmond_dantã_s took some louis_xviii from his pocket and gave them to the man who had twice unconsciously pitied him the guide took them thinking them merely a few pieces of little value but the light of the torch revealed their true worth sir he said you have made a mistake you have given me gold â i know it the concierge looked upon the count with surprise sir he cried scarcely able to believe his good fortuneâ sir
i cannot understand your generosity â_oh it is very simple my good fellow i have been a sailor and your story touched me more than it would others â then sir since you are so liberal i ought to offer you something 50227m what have you to offer to me my friend shells straw work thank you â no sir neither of those something connected with this story â really what is it â listen said the guide i said to myself something is always left in a cell inhabited by one prisoner for fifteen year so i began to sound the wall â ah cried count_of_monte_cristo remembering the abbã s two hiding place after some search i found that the floor gave a hollow sound near the head of the bed and at the hearth â_yes said the count â_yes â i raised the stones and foundâ â a rope ladder and some tools â how do you know that asked the guide in astonishment i do not knowâ i only guess it because that sort of thing is generally found in prisonersâ cells â_yes sir a rope ladder and tools â and have you them yet â no sir i sold them to visitors who considered them great curiosities but i have still something left â what is it asked the count impatiently a sort of book written upon strips of cloth â go and fetch it my good fellow and if it be what i hope you will do well â i will run for it sir and the guide went out then the count knelt down by the side of the bed which death had converted into an altar â_oh second father
he exclaimed thou who hast given me liberty knowledge riches thou who like beings of a superior order to ourselves couldst understand the science of good and evil if in the depths of the tomb there still remain something within us which can respond to the voice of those who are left on earth if after death the soul ever revisit the place where we have lived and suffered then noble heart sublime soul then i conjure thee by the paternal love thou didst bear me by the filial obedience i vowed to thee grant me some sign some revelation remove from me the remains of doubt which if it change not to conviction must become remorse the count bowed his head and clasped his hand together here sir said a voice behind him count_of_monte_cristo shuddered and arose the concierge held out the strips of cloth upon which the abbã_faria had spread the riches of his mind the manuscript was the great work by the abbã_faria upon the kingdoms of italy the count seized it hastily his eye immediately fell upon the epigraph and he read thou shalt tear out the dragonsâ teeth and shall trample the lions under foot saith the lord â ah he exclaimed here is my answer thanks father thanks and feeling in his pocket he took thence a small pocket book which contained ten bank notes each of 000 franc here he said take this pocket book â do you give it to me â_yes but only on condition that you will not open it till i am gone and placing in his breast the treasure he had just found which was more valuable to him than the richest jewel he rushed out of the corridor and reaching his boat cried to marseilles
then as he departed he fixed his eye upon the gloomy prison woe he cried to those who confined me in that wretched prison and woe to those who forgot that i was there 50229m as he repassed the catalans the count turned around and burying his head in his cloak murmured the name of a woman the victory was complete twice he had overcome his doubts the name he pronounced in a voice of tenderness amounting almost to love was that of haydã_e on landing the count turned towards the cemetery where he felt sure of finding m_maximilian_morrel he too ten year ago had piously sought out a tomb and sought it vainly he who returned to france with millions had been unable to find the grave of his father who had perished from hunger m_maximilian_morrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot but it had fallen down and the grave digger had burnt it as he did all the old wood in the churchyard the worthy merchant had been more fortunate dying in the arm of his child he had been by them laid by the side of his wife who had preceded him in eternity by two year two large slabs of marble on which were inscribed their name were placed on either side of a little enclosure railed in and shaded by four cypress trees m_maximilian_morrel was leaning against one of these mechanically fixing his eye on the graves his grief was so profound that he was nearly unconscious 50231m m_maximilian_morrel said the count you should not look on the graves but there and he pointed upwards
â the dead are everywhere said m_maximilian_morrel did you not yourself tell me so as we left paris â m_maximilian_morrel said the count you asked me during the journey to allow you to remain some day at marseilles do you still wish to do so â i have no wishes count only i fancy i could pass the time less painfully here than anywhere else â so much the better for i must leave you but i carry your word with me do i not â ah count i shall forget it â no you will not forget it because you are a man of honor m_maximilian_morrel because you have taken an oath and are about to do so again â_oh count have pity upon me i am so unhappy â i have known a man much more unfortunate than you m_maximilian_morrel â impossible â alas said count_of_monte_cristo â_it is the infirmity of our nature always to believe ourselves much more unhappy than those who groan by our side â what can be more wretched than the man who has lost all he loved and desired in the world â listen m_maximilian_morrel and pay attention to what i am about to tell you i knew a man who like you had fixed all his hopes of happiness upon a woman he was young he had an old father whom he loved a betrothed bride whom he adored
he was about to marry her when one of the caprices of fate which would almost make us doubt the goodness of providence if that providence did not afterwards reveal itself by proving that all is but a means of conducting to an end one of those caprices deprived him of his mistress of the future of which he had dreamed for in his blindness he forgot he could only read the present and cast him into a dungeon â ah said m_maximilian_morrel one quits a dungeon in a week a month or a year â he remained there fourteen year m_maximilian_morrel said the count placing his hand on the young manâ shoulder m_maximilian_morrel shuddered fourteen year he muttered fourteen year repeated the count during that time he had many moment of despair he also m_maximilian_morrel like you considered himself the unhappiest of man â well asked m_maximilian_morrel well at the height of his despair god assisted him through human means at first perhaps he did not recognize the infinite mercy of the lord but at last he took patience and waited one day he miraculously left the prison transformed rich powerful his first cry was for his father but that father was dead â my father too is dead said m_maximilian_morrel â_yes but your father died in your arm happy respected rich and full of year his father died poor despairing almost doubtful of providence and when his son sought his grave ten year afterwards his tomb had disappeared and no one could say there sleeps the father you so well loved â â_oh exclaimed m_maximilian_morrel he was then a more unhappy son than you m_maximilian_morrel for he could not even find his fatherâ grave â but then he had the woman he loved still remaining â you are deceived m_maximilian_morrel that womanâ â
â she was dead â worse than that she was faithless and had married one of the persecutors of her betrothed you see then m_maximilian_morrel that he was a more unhappy lover than you â and has he found consolation â he has at least found peace â and does he ever expect to be happy â he hopes so m_maximilian_morrel the young manâ head fell on his breast you have my promise he said after a minuteâ pause extending his hand to count_of_monte_cristo only rememberâ â on the 5th of october m_maximilian_morrel i shall expect you at the island of count_of_monte_cristo on the 4th a yacht will wait for you in the port of bastia it will be called the eurus you will give your name to the captain who will bring you to me it is understoodâ is it not â but count do you remember that the 5th of octoberâ â child replied the count not to know the value of a manâ word i have told you twenty time that if you wish to die on that day i will assist you m_maximilian_morrel farewell â do you leave me â_yes i have business in italy i leave you alone in your struggle with misfortuneâ alone with that strong winged eagle which god sends to bear aloft the elect to his foot the story of ganymede m_maximilian_morrel is not a fable but an allegory â when do you leave â immediately the steamer waits and in an hour i shall be far from you will you accompany me to the harbor m_maximilian_morrel 50233m i am entirely yours count m_maximilian_morrel accompanied the count to the harbor the white steam was ascending like a plume of feathers from the black chimney
the steamer soon disappeared and in an hour afterwards as the count had said was scarcely distinguishable in the horizon amidst the fogs of the night chapter 114 peppino at the same time that the steamer disappeared behind cape morgiou a man travelling post on the road from florence to rome had just passed the little town of aquapendente he was travelling fast enough to cover a great deal of ground without exciting suspicion this man was dressed in a greatcoat or rather a surtout a little worse for the journey but which exhibited the ribbon of the legion of honor still fresh and brilliant a decoration which also ornamented the under coat he might be recognized not only by these signs but also from the accent with which he spoke to the postilion as a frenchman another proof that he was a native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his knowing no other italian word than the terms used in music and which like the goddamâ of figaro served all possible linguistic requirements allegro he called out to the postilions at every ascent moderato he cried as they descended and heaven knows there are hills enough between rome and florence by the way of aquapendente these two word greatly amused the man to whom they were addressed on reaching la storta the point from whence rome is first visible the traveller evinced none of the enthusiastic curiosity which usually leads strangers to stand up and endeavor to catch sight of the dome of saint peterâ which may be seen long before any other object is distinguishable
no he merely drew a pocketbook from his pocket and took from it a paper folded in four and after having examined it in a manner almost reverential he said good i have it still 50235m the carriage entered by the porta del popolo turned to the left and stopped at the hã tel dâ espagne old signor_pastrini our former acquaintance received the traveller at the door hat in hand the traveller alighted ordered a good dinner and inquired the address of the house_of_peers of thomson_french_of_rome which was immediately given to him as it was one of the most celebrated in rome it was situated in the via dei banchi near st peterâ in rome as everywhere else the arrival of a post chaise is an event ten young descendants of marius and the gracchi barefooted and out at elbows with one hand resting on the hip and the other gracefully curved above the head stared at the traveller the post chaise and the horse to these were added about fifty little vagabonds from the papal states who earned a pittance by diving into the tiber at high water from the bridge of st angelo now as these street arabs of rome more fortunate than those of paris understand every language more especially the french they heard the traveller order an apartment a dinner and finally inquire the way to the house_of_peers of thomson_french_of_rome the result was that when the new comer left the hotel with the cicerone a man detached himself from the rest of the idlers and without having been seen by the traveller and appearing to excite no attention from the guide followed the stranger with as much skill as a parisian police agent would have used
the frenchman had been so impatient to reach the house_of_peers of thomson_french_of_rome that he would not wait for the horse to be harnessed but left word for the carriage to overtake him on the road or to wait for him at the bankersâ door he reached it before the carriage arrived the frenchman entered leaving in the anteroom his guide who immediately entered into conversation with two or three of the industrious idlers who are always to be found in rome at the door of banking house churches museums or theatres with the frenchman the man who had followed him entered too the frenchman knocked at the inner door and entered the first room his shadow did the same messrs thomson_french_of_rome inquired the stranger an attendant arose at a sign from a confidential clerk at the first desk whom shall i announce said the attendant baron mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â follow me said the man a door opened through which the attendant and the baron disappeared the man who had followed mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars sat down on a bench the clerk continued to write for the next five minute the man preserved profound silence and remained perfectly motionless then the pen of the clerk ceased to move over the paper he raised his head and appearing to be perfectly sure of privacy ah ha he said here you are peppino â_yes was the laconic reply you have found out that there is something worth having about this large gentleman â there is no great merit due to me for we were informed of it â you know his business here then â pardieu he has come to draw but i donâ know how much â you will know presently my friend â very well
only do not give me false information as you did the other day â what do you mean of whom do you speak was it the englishman who carried off 000 crowns from here the other day 50237m no he really had 000 crowns and we found them i mean the russian prince who you said had 30 000 livres and we only found 22 000 â you must have searched badly â luigi_vampa himself searched â in that case he must either have paid his debtsâ â a russian do that â or spent the money â possibly after all â certainly but you must let me make my observations or the frenchman will transact his business without my knowing the sum peppino nodded and taking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a few prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same door by which mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and the attendant had gone out at the expiration of ten minute the clerk returned with a beaming countenance well asked peppino of his friend joy joyâ the sum is large â five or six millions is it not â_yes you know the amount â on the receipt of the count_of_monte_cristo â why how came you to be so well acquainted with all this â i told you we were informed beforehand â then why do you apply to me â that i may be sure i have the right man â_yes it is indeed he five millionsâ a pretty sum eh peppino â hushâ here is our man the clerk seized his pen and peppino his beads one was writing and the other praying when the door opened mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars looked radiant with joy the banker accompanied him to the door peppino followed mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars according to the arrangements the carriage was waiting at the door the guide held the door open
guides are useful people who will turn their hand to anything mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars leaped into the carriage like a young man of twenty the cicerone reclosed the door and sprang up by the side of the coachman peppino mounted the seat behind will your excellency visit saint peterâ â asked the cicerone i did not come to rome to see said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars aloud then he added softly with an avaricious smile i came to touch and he rapped his pocket book in which he had just placed a letter then your excellency is goingâ â to the hotel â casa signor_pastrini said the cicerone to the coachman and the carriage drove rapidly on 50239 ten minute afterwards the baron entered his apartment and peppino stationed himself on the bench outside the door of the hotel after having whispered something in the ear of one of the descendants of marius and the gracchi whom we noticed at the beginning of the chapter who immediately ran down the road leading to the capitol at his fullest speed mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was tired and sleepy he therefore went to bed placing his pocketbook under his pillow peppino had a little spare time so he had a game of morra with the facchini lost three crowns and then to console himself drank a bottle of orvieto the next morning mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars awoke late though he went to bed so early he had not slept well for five or six night even if he had slept at all he breakfasted heartily and caring little as he said for the beauties of the eternal city ordered post horse at noon but mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had not reckoned upon the formalities of the police and the idleness of the posting master
the horse only arrived at two oâ clock and the cicerone did not bring the passport till three all these preparations had collected a number of idlers round the door of signor pastriniâ the descendants of marius and the gracchi were also not wanting the baron walked triumphantly through the crowd who for the sake of gain styled him your excellency as mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had hitherto contented himself with being called a baron he felt rather flattered at the title of excellency and distributed a dozen silver coins among the beggars who were ready for twelve more to call him your highness â which road asked the postilion in italian the ancona road replied the baron signor_pastrini interpreted the question and answer and the horse galloped off mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars intended travelling to venice where he would receive one part of his fortune and then proceeding to vienna where he would find the rest he meant to take up his residence in the latter town which he had been told was a city of pleasure he had scarcely advanced three leagues out of rome when daylight began to disappear mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had not intended starting so late or he would have remained he put his head out and asked the postilion how long it would be before they reached the next town non capisco do not understand was the reply mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars bent his head which he meant to imply very well the carriage again moved on i will stop at the first posting house_of_peers said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars to himself he still felt the same self satisfaction which he had experienced the previous evening and which had procured him so good a nightâ rest
he was luxuriously stretched in a good english calash with double springs he was drawn by four good horse at full gallop he knew the relay to be at a distance of seven leagues what subject of meditation could present itself to the banker so fortunately become bankrupt mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars thought for ten minute about his wife in paris another ten minute about his daughter travelling with mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars dâ armilly the same period was given to his creditors and the manner in which he intended spending their money and then having no subject left for contemplation he shut his eye and fell asleep now and then a jolt more violent than the rest caused him to open his eye then he felt that he was still being carried with great rapidity over the same country thickly strewn with broken aqueducts which looked like granite giants petrified while running a race but the night was cold dull and rainy and it was much more pleasant for a traveller to remain in the warm carriage than to put his head out of the window to make inquiries of a postilion whose only answer was non capisco 50241m mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars therefore continued to sleep saying to himself that he would be sure to awake at the posting house_of_peers the carriage stopped mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars fancied that they had reached the long desired point he opened his eye and looked through the window expecting to find himself in the midst of some town or at least village but he saw nothing except what seemed like a ruin where three or four man went and came like shadows mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars waited a moment expecting the postilion to come and demand payment with the termination of his stage
he intended taking advantage of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor but the horse were unharnessed and others put in their place without anyone claiming money from the traveller mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars astonished opened the door but a strong hand pushed him back and the carriage rolled on the baron was completely roused eh he said to the postilion eh mio caro this was another little piece of italian the baron had learned from hearing his daughter sing italian duets with m_andrea_cavalcanti but mio caro did not reply mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars then opened the window come my friend he said thrusting his hand through the opening where are we going â dentro la testa answered a solemn and imperious voice accompanied by a menacing gesture mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars thought dentro la testa meant put in your head he was making rapid progress in italian he obeyed not without some uneasiness which momentarily increasing caused his mind instead of being as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey to fill with idea which were very likely to keep a traveller awake more especially one in such a situation as mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars his eye acquired that quality which in the first moment of strong emotion enables them to see distinctly and which afterwards fails from being too much taxed before we are alarmed we see correctly when we are alarmed we see double and when we have been alarmed we see nothing but trouble mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars observed a man in a cloak galloping at the right hand of the carriage some gendarme he exclaimed can i have been intercepted by french telegrams to the pontifical authorities he resolved to end his anxiety where are you taking me he asked
â dentro la testa replied the same voice with the same menacing accent mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars turned to the left another man on horseback was galloping on that side decidedly said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars with the perspiration on his forehead i must be under arrest and he threw himself back in the calash not this time to sleep but to think directly afterwards the moon rose he then saw the great aqueducts those stone phantoms which he had before remarked only then they were on the right hand now they were on the left he understood that they had described a circle and were bringing him back to rome â_oh unfortunate he cried they must have obtained my arrest the carriage continued to roll on with frightful speed an hour of terror elapsed for every spot they passed showed that they were on the road back at length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome 50243m mon dieu cried mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars we are not returning to rome then it is not justice which is pursuing me gracious heavens another idea presents itselfâ what if they should beâ â his hair stood on end he remembered those interesting stories so little believed in paris respecting roman bandits he remembered the adventures that monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf had related when it was intended that he should marry mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars they are robbers perhaps he muttered just then the carriage rolled on something harder than gravel road
danglars hazarded a look on both side of the road and perceived monuments of a singular form and his mind now recalled all the details viscount_albert_de_morcerf had related and comparing them with his own situation he felt sure that he must be on the appian way on the left in a sort of valley he perceived a circular excavation it was caracallaâ circus on a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage it stopped at the same time the door was opened scendi exclaimed a commanding voice mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars instantly descended although he did not yet speak italian he understood it very well more dead than alive he looked around him four man surrounded him besides the postilion di quã said one of the man descending a little path leading out of the appian way mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars followed his guide without opposition and had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were following him still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal distances from one another like sentinels after walking for about ten minute during which mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars did not exchange a single word with his guide he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds three man standing silent formed a triangle of which he was the centre he wished to speak but his tongue refused to move avanti said the same sharp and imperative voice this time mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars had double reason to understand for if the word and gesture had not explained the speakerâ meaning it was clearly expressed by the man walking behind him who pushed him so rudely that he struck against the guide
this guide was our friend peppino who dashed into the thicket of high weeds through a path which none but lizards or polecats could have imagined to be an open road peppino stopped before a rock overhung by thick hedges the rock half open afforded a passage to the young man who disappeared like the evil spirits in the fairy tales the voice and gesture of the man who followed mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars ordered him to do the same there was no longer any doubt the bankrupt was in the hand of roman banditti mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars acquitted himself like a man placed between two dangerous positions and who is rendered brave by fear notwithstanding his large stomach certainly not intended to penetrate the fissures of the campagna he slid down like peppino and closing his eye fell upon his foot as he touched the ground he opened his eye 50245 the path was wide but dark peppino who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his own territories struck a light and lit a torch two other man descended after mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars forming the rearguard and pushing mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars whenever he happened to stop they came by a gentle declivity to the intersection of two corridors the wall were hollowed out in sepulchres one above the other and which seemed in contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eye like those which we see on the face of the dead a sentinel struck the rings of his carbine against his left hand who comes there he cried a friend a friend said peppino but where is the captain â there said the sentinel pointing over his shoulder to a spacious crypt hollowed out of the rock the light from which shone into the passage through the large arched openings
â fine spoil captain fine spoil said peppino in italian and taking mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door through which they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his dwelling place is this the man asked the captain who was attentively reading plutarchâ life of alexander_vi himself captainâ himself â very well show him to me at this rather impertinent order peppino raised his torch to the face of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who hastily withdrew that he might not have his eyelashes burnt his agitated features presented the appearance of pale and hideous terror the man is tired said the captain conduct him to his bed â_oh murmured mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars that bed is probably one of the coffins hollowed in the wall and the sleep i shall enjoy will be death from one of the poniards i see glistening in the darkness from their bed of dried leaves or wolf skins at the back of the chamber now arose the companions of the man who had been found by monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf reading cã sarâ commentaries and by mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars studying the life of alexander_vi the banker uttered a groan and followed his guide he neither supplicated nor exclaimed he no longer possessed strength will power or feeling he followed where they led him at length he found himself at the foot of a staircase and he mechanically lifted his foot five or six time then a low door was opened before him and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead he entered a small room cut out of the rock the cell was clean though empty and dry though situated at an immeasurable distance under the earth a bed of dried grass covered with goat skins was placed in one corner
danglars brightened up on beholding it fancying that it gave some promise of safety â_oh god be praised he said â_it is a real bed this was the second time within the hour that he had invoked the name of god he had not done so for ten year before ecco said the guide and pushing mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars into the cell he closed the door upon him a bolt grated and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was a prisoner if there had been no bolt it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of st sebastian encamped round a master whom our readers must have recognized as the famous luigi_vampa mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars too had recognized the bandit whose existence he would not believe when monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf mentioned him in paris and not only did he recognize him but the cell in which monsieur_albert had been confined and which was probably kept for the accommodation of strangers these recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars and restored him to some degree of tranquillity since the bandits had not despatched him at once he felt that they would not kill him at all they had arrested him for the purpose of robbery and as he had only a few louis_xviii about him he doubted not he would be ransomed he remembered that viscount_albert_de_morcerf had been taxed at 000 crowns and as he considered himself of much greater importance than viscount_albert_de_morcerf he fixed his own price at 000 crowns eight thousand crowns amounted to 48 000 livres he would then have about 050 000 franc left with this sum he could manage to keep out of difficulties
therefore tolerably secure in being able to extricate himself from his position provided he were not rated at the unreasonable sum of 050 000 franc he stretched himself on his bed and after turning over two or three time fell asleep with the tranquillity of the hero whose life luigi_vampa was studying chapter 115 luigi_vampa vampaâ bill of fare we awake from every sleep except the one dreaded by mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars he awoke to a parisian accustomed to silken curtains wall hung with velvet drapery and the soft perfume of burning wood the white smoke of which diffuses itself in graceful curves around the room the appearance of the whitewashed cell which greeted his eye on awakening seemed like the continuation of some disagreeable dream but in such a situation a single moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into certainty â_yes yes he murmured i am in the hand of the brigands of whom monsieur_albert de viscount_albert_de_morcerf spoke his first idea was to breathe that he might know whether he was wounded he borrowed this from don quixote the only book he had ever read but which he still slightly remembered no he cried they have not wounded but perhaps they have robbed me and he thrust his hand into his pockets they were untouched the hundred louis_xviii he had reserved for his journey from rome to venice were in his trousers pocket and in that of his greatcoat he found the little note case containing his letter of credit for 050 000 franc singular bandits he exclaimed they have left me my purse and pocket book as i was saying last night they intend me to be ransomed hello here is my watch
let me see what time it is danglarsâ watch one of breguetâ repeaters which he had carefully wound up on the previous night struck half past five without this mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars would have been quite ignorant of the time for daylight did not reach his cell should he demand an explanation from the bandits or should he wait patiently for them to propose it the last alternative seemed the most prudent so he waited until twelve oâ clock during all this time a sentinel who had been relieved at eight oâ clock had been watching his door 50249m mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept watch over him he had noticed that a few rays not of daylight but from a lamp penetrated through the ill joined planks of the door he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy which owing to the leathern bottle containing it sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars faugh he exclaimed retreating to the farther corner of his cell at twelve this man was replaced by another functionary and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars wishing to catch sight of his new guardian approached the door again he was an athletic gigantic bandit with large eye thick lip and a flat nose his red hair fell in dishevelled masses like snakes around his shoulders ah ha cried mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars this fellow is more like an ogre than anything else however i am rather too old and tough to be very good eating we see that mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was collected enough to jest at the same time as though to disprove the ogreish propensities the man took some black bread cheese and onions from his wallet which he began devouring voraciously
â may i be hanged said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars glancing at the banditâ dinner through the crevices of the door â may i be hanged if i can understand how people can eat such filth and he withdrew to seat himself upon his goat skin which reminded him of the smell of the brandy but the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible and there are certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting stomach mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then and gradually the man appeared less ugly the bread less black and the cheese more fresh while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side dishes which his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said monsieur_albert deniseau let me have a nice little fricassee today he got up and knocked on the door the bandit raised his head mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars knew that he was heard so he redoubled his blows che cosa asked the bandit come come said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars tapping his fingers against the door i think it is quite time to think of giving me something to eat but whether he did not understand him or whether he had received no order respecting the nourishment of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars the giant without answering went on with his dinner danglarsâ feelings were hurt and not wishing to put himself under obligations to the brute the banker threw himself down again on his goat skin and did not breathe another word four hour passed by and the giant was replaced by another bandit mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who really began to experience sundry gnawings at the stomach arose softly again applied his eye to the crack of the door and recognized the intelligent countenance of his guide
it was indeed peppino who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as possible by seating himself opposite to the door and placing between his legs an earthen pan containing chick peas stewed with bacon near the pan he also placed a pretty little basket of villetri grapes and a flask of orvieto peppino was decidedly an epicure mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars watched these preparations and his mouth watered come he said to himself let me try if he will be more tractable than the other and he tapped gently at the door on va coming exclaimed peppino who from frequenting the house_of_peers of signor_pastrini understood french perfectly in all its idioms mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in such a furious manner put in your head but this was not the time for recrimination so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said with a gracious smile excuse me sir but are they not going to give me any dinner â does your excellency happen to be hungry â happen to be hungry thatâ pretty good when i havenâ eaten for twenty four hour muttered mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars then he added aloud â_yes sir i am hungryâ very hungry â and your excellency wants something to eat â at once if possibleâ nothing easier said peppino here you can get anything you want by paying for it of course as among honest folk â of course cried mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars although in justice the people who arrest and imprison you ought at least to feed you â that is not the custom excellency said peppino a bad reason replied mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars who reckoned on conciliating his keeper but i am content let me have some dinner â at once
what would your excellency like and peppino placed his pan on the ground so that the steam rose directly under the nostrils of mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars give your order â have you kitchens here â kitchens of courseâ complete one â and cooks â excellent â well a fowl fish game â_it signifies little so that i eat â as your excellency pleases you mentioned a fowl i think â_yes a fowl peppino turning around shouted a fowl for his excellency his voice yet echoed in the archway when a handsome graceful and half naked young man appeared bearing a fowl in a silver dish on his head without the assistance of his hand i could almost believe myself at the cafã de paris murmured mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars here your excellency said peppino taking the fowl from the young bandit and placing it on the worm eaten table which with the stool and the goat skin bed formed the entire furniture of the cell mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars asked for a knife and fork here excellency said peppino offering him a little blunt knife and a boxwood fork mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars took the knife in one hand and the fork in the other and was about to cut up the fowl pardon me excellency said peppino placing his hand on the bankerâ shoulder people pay here before they eat they might not be satisfied andâ â ah ha thought mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars this is not so much like paris except that i shall probably be skinned never mind iâ ll fix that all right i have always heard how cheap poultry is in italy i should think a fowl is worth about twelve sous at rome there he said throwing a louis_xviii down peppino picked up the louis_xviii and mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars again prepared to carve the fowl stay a moment your excellency said peppino rising you still owe me something â i
said they would skin me thought mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars but resolving to resist the extortion he said come how much do i owe you for this fowl â your excellency has given me a louis_xviii on account â a louis_xviii on account for a fowl â certainly and your excellency now owes me 999 louis_xviii mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars opened his enormous eye on hearing this gigantic joke very droll he muttered very droll indeed and he again began to carve the fowl when peppino stopped the baronâ right hand with his left and held out his other hand come now he said is it not a joke said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars we never joke replied peppino solemn as a quaker what a hundred thousand franc for a fowl â ah excellency you cannot imagine how hard it is to rear fowls in these horrible caves â come come this is very drollâ very amusingâ i allow but as i am very hungry pray allow me to eat stay here is another louis_xviii for you â then that will make only 998 louis_xviii more said peppino with the same indifference i shall get them all in time â_oh as for that said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars angry at this prolongation of the jest â as for that you wonâ get them at all go to the devil you do not know with whom you have to deal 50253m peppino made a sign and the youth hastily removed the fowl mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars threw himself upon his goat skin and peppino reclosing the door again began eating his peas and bacon though mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars could not see peppino the noise of his teeth allowed no doubt as to his occupation he was certainly eating and noisily too like an ill bred man brute said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars peppino pretended not to hear him and without even turning his head continued to eat slowly
danglarsâ stomach felt so empty that it seemed as if it would be impossible ever to fill it again still he had patience for another half hour which appeared to him like a century he again arose and went to the door come sir do not keep me starving here any longer but tell me what they want â nay your excellency it is you who should tell us what you want give your order and we will execute them â then open the door directly peppino obeyed now look here i want something to eat to eatâ do you hear â are you hungry â come you understand me â what would your excellency like to eat â a piece of dry bread since the fowls are beyond all price in this accursed place â bread very well holloa there some bread he called the youth brought a small loaf how much asked mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars four thousand nine hundred and ninety eight louis_xviii said peppino you have paid two louis_xviii in advance 50255m what one hundred thousand franc for a loaf â one hundred thousand franc repeated peppino but you only asked 100 000 franc for a fowl â we have a fixed price for all our provisions it signifies nothing whether you eat much or littleâ whether you have ten dishes or oneâ it is always the same price â what still keeping up this silly jest my dear fellow it is perfectly ridiculousâ stupid you had better tell me at once that you intend starving me to death â_oh dear no your excellency unless you intend to commit suicide pay and eat â and what am i to pay with brute said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars enraged
â do you suppose i carry 100 000 franc in my pocket â your excellency has 050 000 franc in your pocket that will be fifty fowls at 100 000 franc apiece and half a fowl for the 50 000 mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars shuddered the bandage fell from his eye and he understood the joke which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just before come he said if i pay you the 100 000 franc will you be satisfied and allow me to eat at my ease â certainly said peppino but how can i pay them â_oh nothing easier you have an account open with messrs thomson_french_of_rome via dei banchi rome give me a draft for 998 louis_xviii on these gentlemen and our banker shall take it mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars thought it as well to comply with a good grace so he took the pen ink and paper peppino offered him wrote the draft and signed it here he said here is a draft at sight â and here is your fowl mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars sighed while he carved the fowl it appeared very thin for the price it had cost as for peppino he examined the paper attentively put it into his pocket and continued eating his peas chapter 116 the pardon the next day mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was again hungry certainly the air of that dungeon was very provocative of appetite the prisoner expected that he would be at no expense that day for like an economical man he had concealed half of his fowl and a piece of the bread in the corner of his cell but he had no sooner eaten than he felt thirsty he had forgotten that he struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth then no longer able to resist he called out
the sentinel opened the door it was a new face he thought it would be better to transact business with his old acquaintance so he sent for peppino here i am your excellency said peppino with an eagerness which mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars thought favorable to him what do you want â something to drink â your excellency knows that wine is beyond all price near rome â then give me water cried mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars endeavoring to parry the blow â_oh water is even more scarce than wine your excellency there has been such a drought â come thought mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars â_it is the same old story and while he smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke he felt his temples get moist with perspiration come my friend said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars seeing that he made no impression on peppino you will not refuse me a glass of wine â i have already told you that we do not sell at retail â well then let me have a bottle of the least expensive â they are all the same price â and what is that â twenty five thousand franc a bottle â tell me cried mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars in a tone whose bitterness harpagon30 alone has been capable of revealingâ tell me that you wish to despoil me of all it will be sooner over than devouring me piecemeal â_it is possible such may be the masterâ intention â the master who is he â the person to whom you were conducted yesterday â where is he â here â let me see him â certainly and the next moment luigi_vampa appeared before mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars you sent for me he said to the prisoner are you sir the chief of the people who brought me here â_yes your excellency
what then â how much do you require for my ransom â merely the 000 000 you have about you mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars felt a dreadful spasm dart through his heart but this is all i have left in the world he said out of an immense fortune if you deprive me of that take away my life also â we are forbidden to shed your blood â and by whom are you forbidden â by him we obey â you do then obey someone â_yes a chief â i thought you said you were the chief â so i am of these man but there is another over me â and did your superior order you to treat me in this way â_yes â but my purse will be exhausted â probably â come said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars will you take a million â no â two millions three four come four i will give them to you on condition that you let me go â why do you offer me 000 000 for what is worth 000 000 this is a kind of usury banker that i do not understand â take all thenâ take all i tell you and kill me â come come calm yourself you will excite your blood and that would produce an appetite it would require a million a day to satisfy be more economical â but when i have no more money left to pay you asked the infuriated mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars then you must suffer hunger â suffer hunger said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars becoming pale most likely replied luigi_vampa coolly but you say you do not wish to kill me â no â and yet you will let me perish with hunger â ah that is a different thing â well then wretches cried mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars i will defy your infamous calculationsâ i would rather die at once you may torture torment kill me but you shall not have my signature again â as
your excellency pleases said luigi_vampa as he left the cell mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars raving threw himself on the goat skin who could these man be who was the invisible chief what could be his intentions towards him and why when everyone else was allowed to be ransomed might he not also be oh yes certainly a speedy violent death would be a fine means of deceiving these remorseless enemies who appeared to pursue him with such incomprehensible vengeance but to die for the first time in his life mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars contemplated death with a mixture of dread and desire the time had come when the implacable spectre which exists in the mind of every human creature arrested his attention and called out with every pulsation of his heart thou shalt die mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars resembled a timid animal excited in the chase first it flies then despairs and at last by the very force of desperation sometimes succeeds in eluding its pursuers mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars meditated an escape but the wall were solid rock a man was sitting reading at the only outlet to the cell and behind that man shapes armed with guns continually passed his resolution not to sign lasted two day after which he offered a million for some food they sent him a magnificent supper and took his million from this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer but to have everything he wanted at the end of twelve day after having made a splendid dinner he reckoned his accounts and found that he had only 50 000 franc left
then a strange reaction took place he who had just abandoned 000 000 endeavored to save the 50 000 franc he had left and sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of privationâ he was deluded by the hopefulness that is a premonition of madness he who for so long a time had forgotten god began to think that miracles were possibleâ that the accursed cavern might be discovered by the officers of the papal states who would release him that then he would have 50 000 remaining which would be sufficient to save him from starvation and finally he prayed that this sum might be preserved to him and as he prayed he wept three day passed thus during which his prayers were frequent if not heartfelt sometimes he was delirious and fancied he saw an old man stretched on a pallet he also was dying of hunger on the fourth he was no longer a man but a living corpse he had picked up every crumb that had been left from his former meals and was beginning to eat the matting which covered the floor of his cell then he entreated peppino as he would a guardian angel to give him food he offered him 000 franc for a mouthful of bread but peppino did not answer on the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the cell are you not a christian he said falling on his knees do you wish to assassinate a man who in the eye of heaven is a brother oh my former friend my former friend he murmured and fell with his face to the ground then rising in despair he exclaimed the chief the chief â here i am said luigi_vampa instantly appearing
â what do you want â take my last gold muttered mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars holding out his pocket book and let me live here i ask no more for libertyâ i only ask to live â then you suffer a great deal â_oh yes yes cruelly â still there have been man who suffered more than you â i do not think so â_yes those who have died of hunger mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars thought of the old man whom in his hour of delirium he had seen groaning on his bed he struck his forehead on the ground and groaned â_yes he said there have been some who have suffered more than i have but then they must have been martyrs at least â do you repent asked a deep solemn voice which caused danglarsâ hair to stand on end his feeble eye endeavored to distinguish objects and behind the bandit he saw a man enveloped in a cloak half lost in the shadow of a stone column of what must i repent stammered mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars of the evil you have done said the voice â_oh yes oh yes i do indeed repent and he struck his breast with his emaciated fist then i forgive you said the man dropping his cloak and advancing to the light the count_of_monte_cristo said mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars more pale from terror than he had been just before from hunger and misery you are mistakenâ i am not the count_of_monte_cristo â then who are you 50261m i am he whom you sold and dishonoredâ i am he whose betrothed you prostitutedâ i am
he upon whom you trampled that you might raise yourself to fortuneâ i am he whose father you condemned to die of hungerâ i am he whom you also condemned to starvation and who yet forgives you because he hopes to be forgivenâ i am edmond_dantã_s mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars uttered a cry and fell prostrate rise said the count your life is safe the same good fortune has not happened to your accomplicesâ one is mad the other dead keep the 50 000 franc you have leftâ i give them to you the 000 000 you stole from the hospitals has been restored to them by an unknown hand and now eat and drink i will entertain you tonight luigi_vampa when this man is satisfied let him be free mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew when he raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow before which the bandits bowed according to the countâ directions mademoiselle_eugã_nie_danglars was waited on by luigi_vampa who brought him the best wine and fruits of italy then having conducted him to the road and pointed to the post chaise left him leaning against a tree he remained there all night not knowing where he was when daylight dawned he saw that he was near a stream he was thirsty and dragged himself towards it as he stooped down to drink he saw that his hair had become entirely white chapter 117 the fifth of october it was about six oâ clock in the evening an opal colored light through which an autumnal sun shed its golden rays descended on the blue ocean the heat of the day had gradually decreased and a light breeze arose seeming like the respiration of nature on awakening from the burning siesta of the south
a delicious zephyr played along the coasts of the mediterranean and wafted from shore to shore the sweet perfume of plants mingled with the fresh smell of the sea a light yacht chaste and elegant in its form was gliding amidst the first dews of night over the immense lake extending from gibraltar to the dardanelles and from tunis to venice the vessel resembled a swan with its wings opened towards the wind gliding on the water it advanced swiftly and gracefully leaving behind it a glittering stretch of foam by degrees the sun disappeared behind the western horizon but as though to prove the truth of the fanciful idea in heathen mythology its indiscreet rays reappeared on the summit of every wave as if the god of fire had just sunk upon the bosom of amphitrite who in vain endeavored to hide her lover beneath her azure mantle the yacht moved rapidly on though there did not appear to be sufficient wind to ruffle the curls on the head of a young girl standing on the prow was a tall man of a dark complexion who saw with dilating eye that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a cone which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of a catalan is that count_of_monte_cristo asked the traveller to whose order the yacht was for the time submitted in a melancholy voice â_yes your excellency said the captain we have reached it â we have reached it repeated the traveller in an accent of indescribable sadness then he added in a low tone â_yes that is the haven
and then he again plunged into a train of thought the character of which was better revealed by a sad smile than it would have been by tears a few minute afterwards a flash of light which was extinguished instantly was seen on the land and the sound of firearms reached the yacht your excellency said the captain that was the land signal will you answer yourself â what signal the captain pointed towards the island up the side of which ascended a volume of smoke increasing as it rose ah yes he said as if awaking from a dream give it to me the captain gave him a loaded carbine the traveller slowly raised it and fired in the air ten minute afterwards the sails were furled and they cast anchor about a hundred fathoms from the little harbor the gig was already lowered and in it were four oarsmen and a coxswain the traveller descended and instead of sitting down at the stern of the boat which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his accommodation stood up with his arm crossed the rowers waited their oars half lifted out of the water like birds drying their wings 50265m give way said the traveller the eight oars fell into the sea simultaneously without splashing a drop of water and the boat yielding to the impulsion glided forward in an instant they found themselves in a little harbor formed in a natural creek the boat grounded on the fine sand will your excellency be so good as to mount the shoulders of two of our man they will carry you ashore the young man answered this invitation with a gesture of indifference and stepped out of the boat the sea immediately rose to his waist
â ah your excellency murmured the pilot you should not have done so our master will scold us for it the young man continued to advance following the sailors who chose a firm footing thirty strides brought them to dry land the young man stamped on the ground to shake off the wet and looked around for someone to show him his road for it was quite dark just as he turned a hand rested on his shoulder and a voice which made him shudder exclaimed good evening m_maximilian_morrel you are punctual thank you â ah is it you count said the young man in an almost joyful accent pressing monte cristoâ hand with both his own â_yes you see i am as exact as you are but you are dripping my dear fellow you must change your clothes as calypso said to telemachus come i have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon forget fatigue and cold count_of_monte_cristo perceived that the young man had turned around indeed m_maximilian_morrel saw with surprise that the man who had brought him had left without being paid or uttering a word already the sound of their oars might be heard as they returned to the yacht â_oh yes said the count you are looking for the sailors â_yes i paid them nothing and yet they are gone â never mind that m_maximilian_morrel said count_of_monte_cristo smiling i have made an agreement with the navy that the access to my island shall be free of all charge i have made a bargain m_maximilian_morrel looked at the count with surprise count he said you are not the same here as in paris â how so â here you laugh the countâ brow became clouded
â you are right to recall me to myself m_maximilian_morrel he said i was delighted to see you again and forgot for the moment that all happiness is fleeting â_oh no no count cried m_maximilian_morrel seizing the countâ hand pray laugh be happy and prove to me by your indifference that life is endurable to sufferers oh how charitable kind and good you are you affect this gayety to inspire me with courage â you are wrong m_maximilian_morrel i was really happy â then you forget me so much the better â how so â_yes for as the gladiator said to the emperor when he entered the arena he who is about to die salutes you â then you are not consoled asked the count surprised â_oh exclaimed m_maximilian_morrel with a glance full of bitter reproach do you think it possible that i could be â listen said the count do you understand the meaning of my word you cannot take me for a commonplace man a mere rattle emitting a vague and senseless noise when i ask you if you are consoled i speak to you as a man for whom the human heart has no secrets well m_maximilian_morrel let us both examine the depths of your heart do you still feel the same feverish impatience of grief which made you start like a wounded lion have you still that devouring thirst which can only be appeased in the grave are you still actuated by the regret which drags the living to the pursuit of death or are you only suffering from the prostration of fatigue and the weariness of hope deferred has the loss of memory rendered it impossible for you to weep
oh my dear friend if this be the case if you can no longer weep if your frozen heart be dead if you put all your trust in god then m_maximilian_morrel you are consoledâ do not complain â count said m_maximilian_morrel in a firm and at the same time soft voice listen to me as to a man whose thoughts are raised to heaven though he remains on earth i come to die in the arm of a friend certainly there are people whom i love i love my sister mademoiselle_julie i love her husband m_emmanuel but i require a strong mind to smile on my last moment my sister would be bathed in tears and fainting i could not bear to see her suffer m_emmanuel would tear the weapon from my hand and alarm the house_of_peers with his cries you count who are more than mortal will i am sure lead me to death by a pleasant path will you not 50267m my friend said the count i have still one doubt are you weak enough to pride yourself upon your sufferings â no indeed i am calm said m_maximilian_morrel giving his hand to the count my pulse does not beat slower or faster than usual no i feel that i have reached the goal and i will go no farther you told me to wait and hope do you know what you did unfortunate adviser i waited a month or rather i suffered for a month i did hope man is a poor wretched creature i did hope what i cannot tell something wonderful an absurdity a miracle of what nature he alone can tell who has mingled with our reason that folly we call hope yes i did waitâ yes
i did hope count and during this quarter of an hour we have been talking together you have unconsciously wounded tortured my heart for every word you have uttered proved that there was no hope for me oh count i shall sleep calmly deliciously in the arm of death m_maximilian_morrel uttered these word with an energy which made the count shudder my friend continued m_maximilian_morrel you named the fifth of october as the end of the period of waiting today is the fifth of october he took out his watch â_it is now nine oâ clock i have yet three hour to live â be it so said the count come m_maximilian_morrel mechanically followed the count and they had entered the grotto before he perceived it he felt a carpet under his foot a door opened perfumes surrounded him and a brilliant light dazzled his eye m_maximilian_morrel hesitated to advance he dreaded the enervating effect of all that he saw count_of_monte_cristo drew him in gently why should we not spend the last three hour remaining to us of life like those ancient romans who when condemned by nero their emperor and heir sat down at a table covered with flowers and gently glided into death amid the perfume of heliotropes and roses m_maximilian_morrel smiled as you please he said death is always death that is forgetfulness repose exclusion from life and therefore from grief he sat down and count_of_monte_cristo placed himself opposite to him they were in the marvellous dining room before described where the statues had baskets on their head always filled with fruits and flowers m_maximilian_morrel had looked carelessly around and had probably noticed nothing let us talk like man he said looking at the count
â go on â count said m_maximilian_morrel you are the epitome of all human knowledge and you seem like a being descended from a wiser and more advanced world than ours â there is something true in what you say said the count with that smile which made him so handsome i have descended from a planet called grief 50269m i believe all you tell me without questioning its meaning for instance you told me to live and i did live you told me to hope and i almost did so i am almost inclined to ask you as though you had experienced death is it painful to die â count_of_monte_cristo looked upon m_maximilian_morrel with indescribable tenderness â_yes he said â_yes doubtless it is painful if you violently break the outer covering which obstinately begs for life if you plunge a dagger into your flesh if you insinuate a bullet into your brain which the least shock disorders then certainly you will suffer pain and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price â_yes i know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death as well as in life the only thing is to understand it â you have spoken truly m_maximilian_morrel according to the care we bestow upon it death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse or an enemy who violently drags the soul from the body
some day when the world is much older and when mankind will be masters of all the destructive powers in nature to serve for the general good of humanity when mankind as you were just saying have discovered the secrets of death then that death will become as sweet and voluptuous as a slumber in the arm of your beloved â and if you wished to die you would choose this death count â_yes m_maximilian_morrel extended his hand now i understand he said why you had me brought here to this desolate spot in the midst of the ocean to this subterranean palace it was because you loved me was it not count it was because you loved me well enough to give me one of those sweet means of death of which we were speaking a death without agony a death which allows me to fade away while pronouncing valentineâ name and pressing your hand â_yes you have guessed rightly m_maximilian_morrel said the count that is what i intended â thanks the idea that tomorrow i shall no longer suffer is sweet to my heart â do you then regret nothing â no replied m_maximilian_morrel not even me asked the count with deep emotion morrelâ clear eye was for the moment clouded then it shone with unusual lustre and a large tear rolled down his cheek what said the count do you still regret anything in the world and yet die â_oh i entreat you exclaimed m_maximilian_morrel in a low voice do not speak another word count do not prolong my punishment the count fancied that he was yielding and this belief revived the horrible doubt that had overwhelmed him at the chã teau dâ if
â i am endeavoring he thought to make this man happy i look upon this restitution as a weight thrown into the scale to balance the evil i have wrought now supposing i am deceived supposing this man has not been unhappy enough to merit happiness alas what would become of me who can only atone for evil by doing good 50271m then he said aloud listen m_maximilian_morrel i see your grief is great but still you do not like to risk your soul m_maximilian_morrel smiled sadly count he said i swear to you my soul is no longer my own â m_maximilian_morrel you know i have no relation in the world i have accustomed myself to regard you as my son well then to save my son i will sacrifice my life nay even my fortune â what do you mean â i mean that you wish to quit life because you do not understand all the enjoyments which are the fruits of a large fortune m_maximilian_morrel i possess nearly a hundred millions and i give them to you with such a fortune you can attain every wish are you ambitious every career is open to you overturn the world change its character yield to mad idea be even criminalâ but live â count i have your word said m_maximilian_morrel coldly then taking out his watch he added â_it is half past eleven â m_maximilian_morrel can you intend it in my house_of_peers under my very eye â then let me go said m_maximilian_morrel or i shall think you did not love me for my own sake but for yours and he arose â_it is well said count_of_monte_cristo whose countenance brightened at these word you wish itâ you are inflexible yes as you said you are indeed wretched and a miracle alone can cure you
sit down m_maximilian_morrel and wait m_maximilian_morrel obeyed the count arose and unlocking a closet with a key suspended from his gold chain took from it a little silver casket beautifully carved and chased the corners of which represented four bending figures similar to the caryatides the forms of woman symbols of the angels aspiring to heaven he placed the casket on the table then opening it took out a little golden box the top of which flew open when touched by a secret spring this box contained an unctuous substance partly solid of which it was impossible to discover the color owing to the reflection of the polished gold sapphires rubies emeralds which ornamented the box it was a mixed mass of blue red and gold the count took out a small quantity of this with a gilt spoon and offered it to m_maximilian_morrel fixing a long steadfast glance upon him it was then observable that the substance was greenish this is what you asked for he said and what i promised to give you â i thank you from the depths of my heart said the young man taking the spoon from the hand of count_of_monte_cristo the count took another spoon and again dipped it into the golden box what are you going to do my friend asked m_maximilian_morrel arresting his hand well the fact is m_maximilian_morrel i was thinking that i too am weary of life and since an opportunity presents itselfâ â stay said the young man you who love and are beloved you who have faith and hope â_oh do not follow my example in your case it would be a crime adieu my noble and generous friend adieu i will go and tell mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort what you have done for me
and slowly though without any hesitation only waiting to press the countâ hand fervently he swallowed the mysterious substance offered by count_of_monte_cristo then they were both silent ali_pasha_of_yanina mute and attentive brought the pipes and coffee and disappeared by degrees the light of the lamps gradually faded in the hand of the marble statues which held them and the perfumes appeared less powerful to m_maximilian_morrel seated opposite to him count_of_monte_cristo watched him in the shadow and m_maximilian_morrel saw nothing but the bright eye of the count an overpowering sadness took possession of the young man his hand relaxed their hold the objects in the room gradually lost their form and color and his disturbed vision seemed to perceive door and curtains open in the wall 50273m friend he cried i feel that i am dying thanks he made a last effort to extend his hand but it fell powerless beside him then it appeared to him that count_of_monte_cristo smiled not with the strange and fearful expression which had sometimes revealed to him the secrets of his heart but with the benevolent kindness of a father for a child at the same time the count appeared to increase in stature his form nearly double its usual height stood out in relief against the red tapestry his black hair was thrown back and he stood in the attitude of an avenging angel m_maximilian_morrel overpowered turned around in the armchair a delicious torpor permeated every vein a change of idea presented themselves to his brain like a new design on the kaleidoscope enervated prostrate and breathless he became unconscious of outward objects he seemed to be entering that vague delirium preceding death he wished once again to press the countâ hand but his own was immovable
he wished to articulate a last farewell but his tongue lay motionless and heavy in his throat like a stone at the mouth of a sepulchre involuntarily his languid eye closed and still through his eyelashes a well known form seemed to move amid the obscurity with which he thought himself enveloped the count had just opened a door immediately a brilliant light from the next room or rather from the palace adjoining shone upon the room in which he was gently gliding into his last sleep then he saw a woman of marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door separating the two room pale and sweetly smiling she looked like an angel of mercy conjuring the angel of vengeance is it heaven that opens before me thought the dying man that angel resembles the one i have lost count_of_monte_cristo pointed out m_maximilian_morrel to the young woman who advanced towards him with clasped hand and a smile upon her lip mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort valentine he mentally ejaculated but his lip uttered no sound and as though all his strength were centred in that internal emotion he sighed and closed his eye mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort rushed towards him his lip again moved he is calling you said the count he to whom you have confided your destinyâ he from whom death would have separated you calls you to him happily i vanquished death henceforth mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort you will never again be separated on earth since he has rushed into death to find you without me you would both have died may god accept my atonement in the preservation of these two existences mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort seized the countâ hand and in her irresistible impulse of joy carried it to her lip
50275m â_oh thank me again said the count tell me till you are weary that i have restored you to happiness you do not know how much i require this assurance â_oh yes yes i thank you with all my heart said mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and if you doubt the sincerity of my gratitude oh then ask haydã_e ask my beloved sister haydã_e who ever since our departure from france has caused me to wait patiently for this happy day while talking to me of you â you then love haydã_e asked count_of_monte_cristo with an emotion he in vain endeavored to dissimulate â_oh yes with all my soul â well then listen mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort said the count i have a favor to ask of you â of me oh am i happy enough for that â_yes you have called haydã_e your sister let her become so indeed mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort render her all the gratitude you fancy that you owe to me protect her forâ the countâ voice was thick with emotion henceforth she will be alone in the world â alone in the world repeated a voice behind the count and why count_of_monte_cristo turned around haydã_e was standing pale motionless looking at the count with an expression of fearful amazement because tomorrow haydã_e you will be free you will then assume your proper position in society for i will not allow my destiny to overshadow yours daughter of a prince i restore to you the riches and name of your father haydã_e became pale and lifting her transparent hand to heaven exclaimed in a voice stifled with tears then you leave me my lord â haydã e
haydã_e you are young and beautiful forget even my name and be happy â_it is well said haydã_e your order shall be executed my lord i will forget even your name and be happy and she stepped back to retire â_oh heavens exclaimed mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort who was supporting the head of m_maximilian_morrel on her shoulder do you not see how pale she is do you not see how she suffers haydã_e answered with a heartrending expression why should he understand this my sister he is my master and i am his slave he has the right to notice nothing the count shuddered at the tone of a voice which penetrated the inmost recesses of his heart his eye met those of the young girl and he could not bear their brilliancy â_oh heavens exclaimed count_of_monte_cristo can my suspicions be correct haydã_e would it please you not to leave me â i am young gently replied haydã_e i love the life you have made so sweet to me and i should be sorry to die â you mean then that if i leave you haydã eâ â i should die yes my lord â do you then love me â_oh mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort he asks if i love him mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort tell him if you love m_maximilian_morrel the count felt his heart dilate and throb he opened his arm and haydã_e uttering a cry sprang into them â_oh yes she cried i do love you i love you as one loves a father brother husband
i love you as my life for you are the best the noblest of created beings 50277m let it be then as you wish sweet angel god has sustained me in my struggle with my enemies and has given me this reward he will not let me end my triumph in suffering i wished to punish myself but he has pardoned me love me then haydã_e who knows perhaps your love will make me forget all that i do not wish to remember â what do you mean my lord â i mean that one word from you has enlightened me more than twenty year of slow experience i have but you in the world haydã_e through you i again take hold on life through you i shall suffer through you rejoice â do you hear him mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort exclaimed haydã_e he says that through me he will sufferâ through me who would yield my life for his the count withdrew for a moment have i discovered the truth he said but whether it be for recompense or punishment i accept my fate come haydã_e come and throwing his arm around the young girlâ waist he pressed the hand of mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort and disappeared 50279m an hour had nearly passed during which mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort breathless and motionless watched steadfastly over m_maximilian_morrel at length she felt his heart beat a faint breath played upon his lip a slight shudder announcing the return of life passed through the young manâ frame at length his eye opened but they were at first fixed and expressionless then sight returned and with it feeling and grief â_oh he cried in an accent of despair the count has deceived me i am yet living and extending his hand towards the table he seized a knife
