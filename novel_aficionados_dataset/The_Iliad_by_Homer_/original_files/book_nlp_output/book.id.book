If , in the absence of evidence , we may venture upon naming any more determinate period , the question a once suggests itself , What were the purposes which , in that state of society , a manuscript at its first commencement must have been intended to answer ? For whom was a written Iliad necessary ? Not for the rhapsodes ; for with them it was not only planted in the memory , but also interwoven with the feelings , and conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of voice , pauses , and other oral artifices which were required for emphatic delivery , and which the naked manuscript could never reproduce . Not for the general public -- they were accustomed to receive it with its rhapsodic delivery , and with its accompaniments of a solemn and crowded festival . The only persons for whom the written Iliad would be suitable would be a select few ; studious and curious men ; a class of readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had experienced as hearers in the crowd , and who would , on perusing the written words , realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the impression communicated by the reciter . Incredible as the statement may seem in an age like the present , there is in all early societies , and there was in early Greece , a time when no such reading class existed . If we could discover at what time such a class first began to be formed , we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poems were first committed to writing . Now the period which may with the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even of the narrowest reading class in Greece , is the middle of the seventh century before the Christian aera -LRB- B.C. 660 to B.C. 630 -RRB- , the age of Terpander , Kallinus , Archilochus , Simonides of Amorgus , & c. I ground this supposition on the change then operated in the character and tendencies of Grecian poetry and music -- the elegiac and the iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to the primitive hexameter , and poetical compositions having been transferred from the epical past to the affairs of present and real life . Such a change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of publication -LRB- to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable , yet the nearest approaching to the sense -RRB- . It argued a new way of looking at the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new poetical effect ; and the men who stood forward in it , may well be considered as desirous to study , and competent to criticize , from their own individual point of view , the written words of the Homeric rhapsodies , just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and eulogized the Thebais as the production of Homer . There seems , therefore , ground for conjecturing that -LRB- for the use of this newly-formed and important , but very narrow class -RRB- , manuscripts of the Homeric poems and other old epics , -- the Thebais and the Cypria , as well as the Iliad and the Odyssey , -- began to be compiled towards the middle of the seventh century -LRB- B.C. 1 -RRB- ; and the opening of Egypt to Grecian commerce , which took place about the same period , would furnish increased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to write upon . A reading class , when once formed , would doubtless slowly increase , and the number of manuscripts along with it ; so that before the time of Solon , fifty years afterwards , both readers and manuscripts , though still comparatively few , might have attained a certain recognized authority , and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness of individual rhapsodes .

The average would be eighty-five , and Thucydides supposes the troops to have rowed and navigated themselves ; and that very few , besides the chiefs , went as mere passengers or landsmen . In short , we have in the Homeric descriptions the complete picture of an Indian or African war canoe , many of which are considerably larger than the largest scale assigned to those of the Greeks . If the total number of the Greek ships be taken at twelve hundred , according to Thucydides , although in point of fact there are only eleven hundred and eighty-six in the Catalogue , the amount of the army , upon the foregoing average , will be about a hundred and two thousand men . The historian considers this a small force as representing all Greece . Bryant , comparing it with the allied army at Platae , thinks it so large as to prove the entire falsehood of the whole story ; and his reasonings and calculations are , for their curiosity , well worth a careful perusal . '' ","i":221442},{"w":"`` No trumpets , or any other instruments of sound , are used in the Homeric action itself ; but the trumpet was known , and is introduced for the purpose of illustration as employed in war . Hence arose the value of a loud voice in a commander ; Stentor was an indispensable officer ... In the early Saracen campaigns frequent mention is made of the service rendered by men of uncommonly strong voices ; the battle of Honain was restored by the shouts and menaces of Abbas , the uncle of Mohammed , '' ","i":224363},{"w":"`` In the mythology , also , of the Iliad , purely Pagan as it is , we discover one important truth unconsciously involved , which was almost entirely lost from view amidst the nearly equal scepticism and credulity of subsequent ages . Zeus or Jupiter is popularly to be taken as omnipotent . No distinct empire is assigned to fate or fortune ; the will of the father of gods and men is absolute and uncontrollable . This seems to be the true character of the Homeric deity , and it is very necessary that the student of Greek literature should bear it constantly in mind . A strong instance in the Iliad itself to illustrate this position , is the passage where Jupiter laments to Juno the approaching death of Sarpedon . ' Alas me ! ' says he ` since it is fated -LRB- moira -RRB- that Sarpedon , dearest to me of men , should be slain by Patroclus , the son of Menoetius ! Indeed , my heart is divided within me while I ruminate it in my mind , whether having snatched him up from out of the lamentable battle , I should not at once place him alive in the fertile land of his own Lycia , or whether I should now destroy him by the hands of the son of Menoetius ! ' To which Juno answers -- ` Dost thou mean to rescue from death a mortal man , long since destined by fate -LRB- palai pepromenon -RRB- ? You may do it -- but we , the rest of the gods , do not sanction it . ' Here it is clear from both speakers , that although Sarpedon is said to be fated to die , Jupiter might still , if he pleased , save him , and place him entirely out of the reach of any such event , and further , in the alternative , that Jupiter himself would destroy him by the hands of another . '' ","i":230391},{"w":"`` By a close study of life , and by a true and natural mode of expressing everything , Homer was enabled to venture upon the most peculiar and difficult situations , and to extricate himself from them with the completest success . The whole scene between Achilles and Priam , when the latter comes to the Greek camp for the purpose of redeeming the body of Hector , is at once the most profoundly skilful , and yet the simplest and most affecting passage in the Iliad . Quinctilian has taken notice of the following speech of Priam , the rhetorical artifice of which is so transcendent , that if genius did not often , especially in oratory , unconsciously fulfil the most subtle precepts of criticism , we might be induced , on this account alone , to consider the last book of the Iliad as what is called spurious , in other words , of later date than the rest of the poem . Observe the exquisite taste of Priam in occupying the mind of Achilles , from the outset , with the image of his father ; in gradually introducing the parallel of his own situation ; and , lastly , mentioning Hector 's name when he perceives that the hero is softened , and then only in such a manner as to flatter the pride of the conqueror . The ego d'eleeinoteros per , and the apusato aecha geronta , are not exactly like the tone of the earlier parts of the Iliad . They are almost too fine and pathetic . The whole passage defies translation , for there is that about the Greek which has no name , but which is of so fine and ethereal a subtlety that it can only be felt in the original , and is lost in an attempt to transfuse it into another language .

'' ","i":7704},{"w":"`` History of Greek Literature , '' ","i":217236},{"w":"`` The Catalogue is , perhaps , the portion of the poem in favour of which a claim to separate authorship has been most plausibly urged . Although the example of Homer has since rendered some such formal enumeration of the forces engaged , a common practice in epic poems descriptive of great warlike adventures , still so minute a statistical detail can neither be considered as imperatively required , nor perhaps such as would , in ordinary cases , suggest itself to the mind of a poet . Yet there is scarcely any portion of the Iliad where both historical and internal evidence are more clearly in favour of a connection from the remotest period , with the remainder of the work . The composition of the Catalogue , whensoever it may have taken place , necessarily presumes its author 's acquaintance with a previously existing Iliad . It were impossible otherwise to account for the harmony observable in the recurrence of so vast a number of proper names , most of them historically unimportant , and not a few altogether fictitious : or of so many geographical and genealogical details as are condensed in these few hundred lines , and incidentally scattered over the thousands which follow : equally inexplicable were the pointed allusions occurring in this episode to events narrated in the previous and subsequent text , several of which could hardly be of traditional notoriety , but through the medium of the Iliad . '' ","i":221171},{"w":"`` Language and Literature of Greece , '' ","i":221423},{"w":"`` A similar bond of connexion , in the military details of the narrative , is the decree issued by Jupiter , at the commencement of the eighth book , against any further interference of the gods in the battles . In the opening of the twentieth book this interdict is withdrawn . During the twelve intermediate books it is kept steadily in view . No interposition takes place but on the part of the specially authorised agents of Jove , or on that of one or two contumacious deities , described as boldly setting his commands at defiance , but checked and reprimanded for their disobedience ; while the other divine warriors , who in the previous and subsequent cantos are so active in support of their favourite heroes , repeatedly allude to the supreme edict as the cause of their present inactivity . '' ","i":226127},{"w":"`` Perhaps the boldest excursion of Homer into this region of poetical fancy is the collision into which , in the twenty-first of the Iliad , he has brought the river god Scamander , first with Achilles , and afterwards with Vulcan , when summoned by Juno to the hero 's aid . The overwhelming fury of the stream finds the natural interpretation in the character of the mountain torrents of Greece and Asia Minor . Their wide , shingly beds are in summer comparatively dry , so as to be easily forded by the foot passenger . But a thunder-shower in the mountains , unobserved perhaps by the traveller on the plain , may suddenly immerse him in the flood of a mighty river . The rescue of Achilles by the fiery arms of Vulcan scarcely admits of the same ready explanation from physical causes . Yet the subsiding of the flood at the critical moment when the hero 's destruction appeared imminent , might , by a slight extension of the figurative parallel , be ascribed to a god symbolic of the influences opposed to all atmospheric moisture . '' ","i":232597},{"w":"`` Achilles ' ferocious treatment of the corpse of Hector can not but offend as referred to the modern standard of humanity . The heroic age , however , must be judged by its own moral laws . Retributive vengeance on the dead , as well as the living , was a duty inculcated by the religion of those barbarous times which not only taught that evil inflicted on the author of evil was a solace to the injured man ; but made the welfare of the soul after death dependent on the fate of the body from which it had separated . Hence a denial of the rites essential to the soul 's admission into the more favoured regions of the lower world was a cruel punishment to the wanderer on the dreary shores of the infernal river . The complaint of the ghost of Patroclus to Achilles , of but a brief postponement of his own obsequies , shows how efficacious their refusal to the remains of his destroyer must have been in satiating the thirst of revenge , which , even after death , was supposed to torment the dwellers in Hades . Hence before yielding up the body of Hector to Priam , Achilles asks pardon of Patroclus for even this partial cession of his just rights of retribution .
