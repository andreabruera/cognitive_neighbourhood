according to michael nagler the iliad is more complicated epic poem than the odyssey influence on the #art# and literature the first verses of the iliad note book numbers are in parentheses and come before the synopsis of the book after an invocation to the muses the story launches in medias res towards the end of the trojan #war# between the $ye_trojans$ and the besieging greeks chryses trojan priest of apollo offers the greeks wealth for the return of his daughter chryseis held captive of agamemnon the greek leader although most of the greek army is in favour of the offer agamemnon refuses chryses prays for apollo help and apollo causes plague to afflict the greek army after nine #day# of plague $achilles$ the leader of the myrmidon contingent calls an assembly to deal with the problem under pressure agamemnon agrees to return chryseis to her father but decides to take $achilles$ captive briseis as compensation $achilles$ furiously declares that he and his #man# will no longer #fight# for agamemnon and will go home odysseus takes #ship# and returns chryseis to her father whereupon apollo ends the plague in the meantime agamemnon messengers take briseis away $achilles$ becomes very upset sits by the seashore and prays to his mother thetis $achilles$ asks his mother to ask zeus to bring the greeks to the breaking point by the $ye_trojans$ so agamemnon will realize how much the greeks need $achilles$ thetis does so and zeus agrees zeus sends dream to agamemnon urging him to attack $troy$ agamemnon heeds the dream but first decides to test the greek army morale by telling them to go home the plan backfires and only the intervention of odysseus inspired by athena stops rout

the #god# in traditional thought of fourth century athenians were not spoken of in terms familiar to us from $homer$ the classical era historian herodotus says that $homer$ and hesiod his contemporary were the first writers to name and describe the #god# appearance and character in greek #god# human lives what we can learn from myths mary lefkowitz discusses the relevance of divine action in the iliad attempting to answer the question of whether or not divine intervention is discrete occurrence for its own sake or if such godly behaviors are mere human character metaphors the intellectual interest of classic era authors such as thucydides and plato was limited to their utility as a #way# of talking about human life rather than description or truth because if the #god# remain religious figures rather than human metaphors their existence without the foundation of either dogma or bible of faithsâ then allowed greek culture the intellectual breadth and freedom to conjure #god# fitting any religious function they required as people the religion had no founder and was not the creation of an inspired teacher which were popular origins of existing religions in the world the individuals were free to believe what they wanted as the greek religion was created out of consensus of the people these beliefs coincide to the thoughts about the #god# in polytheistic greek religion in the article greek religion a h adkins agrees with this by saying the early greeks personalized every aspect of their world natural and cultural and their experiences in it
the #earth# the sea the mountains the rivers custom law themis and oneâ share in society and its goods were all seen in personal as well as naturalistic terms as result of this thinking each #god# or goddess in polytheistic greek religion is attributed to an aspect of the human world for example poseidon is the #god# of the sea aphrodite is the goddess of beauty ares is the #god# of #war# and so on and so forth for many other #god# this is how greek culture was defined as many athenians felt the presence of their #god# through divine intervention in significant events in their lives oftentimes they found these events to be mysterious and inexplicable in the origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind psychologist julian jaynes uses the iliad as major piece of evidence for his theory of bicameralism which posits that until about the time described in the iliad humans had far different mentality from present #day# humans he says that humans during that time were lacking what we today call consciousness he suggests that humans heard and obeyed commands from what they identified as #god# until the change in human mentality that incorporated the motivating #force# into the conscious self he points out that almost every action in the iliad is directed caused or influenced by #god# and that earlier translations show an astonishing lack of #word# suggesting thought planning or introspection those that do appear he argues are misinterpretations made by translators imposing modern mentality on the characters some scholars believe that the #god# may have intervened in the mortal world because of quarrels they may have had among each other
homer interprets the world at this time by using the passion and emotion of the #god# to be determining factors of what happens on the human level an example of one of these relationships in the iliad occurs between athena hera and aphrodite in the final book of the poem $homer$ writes he offended athena and heraâ both goddesses athena and hera are envious of aphrodite because of beauty pageant on mount $olympus$ in which paris chose aphrodite to be the most beautiful goddess over both hera and athena wolfgang kullmann further goes on to say heraâ and athenaâ disappointment over the victory of aphrodite in the judgement of paris determines the whole conduct of both goddesses in the iliad and is the cause of their hatred for paris the judge and his town $troy$ hera and athena then continue to support the achaean #force# throughout the poem because paris is #part# of the $ye_trojans$ while aphrodite aids paris and the $ye_trojans$ the emotions between the goddesses often translate to actions they take in the mortal world for example in book of the iliad paris challenges any of the achaeans to single combat and $great_menelaus$ steps forward $great_menelaus$ was dominating the battle and was on the verge of killing paris now heâ have hauled him off and won undying #glory# but aphrodite zeusâ daughter was quick to the mark snapped the rawhide strap aphrodite intervened out of her own self interest to save paris from the wrath of $great_menelaus$ because paris had helped her to win the beauty pageant the partisanship of aphrodite towards paris induces constant intervention by all of the #god# especially to give motivational speeches to their respective proteges while often appearing in the shape of human being they are familiar with
this connection of emotions to actions is just one example out of many that occur throughout the poem #fate# îºî kä fated #death# propels most of the events of the iliad once set #god# and #man# abide it neither truly able nor willing to contest it how #fate# is set is unknown but it is told by the #fate# and by zeus through sending omens to seers such as calchas #man# and their #god# continually speak of heroic acceptance and cowardly avoidance of one slated #fate# no deadly destiny with the #son# of leto has killed me and of #man# it was euphorbos you are only my third slayer and put away in your #heart# this other thing that tell you you yourself are not one who shall live long but now already #death# and powerful destiny are standing beside you to go down under the #hand# of aiakos great #son# achilleus here patroclus alludes to fated #death# by $stern_hector$ #hand# and $stern_hector$ fated #death# by $achilles$ #hand# each accepts the outcome of his life yet no one knows if the #god# can alter #fate# the first instance of this doubt occurs in book xvi seeing patroclus about to kill $sarpedon$ his mortal #son# zeus says ah me that it is destined that the dearest of #man# $sarpedon$ must go down under the #hand# of menoitios #son# patroclus about his dilemma hera asks zeus majesty #son# of kronos what sort of thing have you spoken do you wish to bring back #man# who is mortal one long since doomed by his destiny from ill sounding #death# and release him do it then but not all the rest of us #god# shall approve you in deciding between losing #son# or abiding #fate# zeus #king# of the #god# allows it
this motif recurs when he considers sparing $stern_hector$ whom he loves and respects this time it is athene who challenges him father of the shining bolt dark misted what is this you said do you wish to bring back #man# who is mortal one long since doomed by his destiny from ill sounding #death# and release him do it then but not all the rest of us #god# shall approve you again zeus appears capable of altering #fate# but does not deciding instead to abide set outcomes similarly #fate# spares aeneas after apollo convinces the over matched trojan to #fight# $achilles$ but come let us ourselves get him away from #death# for fear the #son# of kronos may be angered if now achilleus it is destined that he shall be the survivor that the generation of dardanos shall not die divinely aided aeneas escapes the wrath of $achilles$ and survives the trojan #war# whether or not the #god# can alter #fate# they do abide it despite its countering their human allegiances thus the mysterious origin of #fate# is #power# beyond the #god# #fate# implies the primeval tripartite division of the world that zeus poseidon and hades effected in deposing their father cronus for its dominion zeus took the air and the #sky# poseidon the waters and hades the underworld the land of the deadâ yet they share dominion of the #earth# despite the earthly #power# of the olympic #god# only the three #fate# set the destiny of #man# kleos îºî î #glory# fame is the concept of #glory# earned in heroic battle yet $achilles$ must choose only one of the two rewards either nostos or kleos in book ix ix he poignantly tells agamemnon envoysâ odysseus phoenix ajaxâ begging his reinstatement to battle about having to choose between two #fate# î¹ï î î ï

literature was central to the educational cultural function of the itinerant rhapsode who composed consistent epic poems from memory and improvisation and disseminated them via song and chant in his travels and at the panathenaic festival of athletics music poetics and sacrifice celebrating athena birthday originally classical scholars treated the iliad and the odyssey as written poetry and $homer$ as writer yet by the milman parry had launched movement claiming otherwise his investigation of the oral homeric styleâ stock epithets and reiteration #word# phrases stanzas established that these formulae were artifacts of oral tradition easily applied to hexametric line a two #word# stock epithet g resourceful odysseus reiteration may complement character name by filling half line thus freeing the poet to compose half line of original formulaic text to complete his meaning in yugoslavia parry and his assistant albert lord studied the oral formulaic composition of serbian oral poetry yielding the parry lord thesis that established oral tradition studies later developed by eric havelock marshall mcluhan walter ong and gregory nagy in the singer of tales lord presents likenesses between the tragedies of the greek patroclus in the iliad and of the sumerian enkidu in the epic of gilgamesh and claims to refute with careful analysis of the repetition of thematic patterns that the patroclus storyline upsets $homer$ established compositional formulae of wrath bride stealing and rescue thus stock phrase reiteration does not restrict his originality in fitting story to rhyme creates an atmosphere of smoothness wherein $homer$ distinguishes patroclus from $achilles$ and foreshadows the former #death# with positive and negative turns of phrase in the iliad occasional syntactic inconsistency may be an oral tradition effectâ for example

that how close they were to one another in describing infantry combat $homer$ names the phalanx formation but most scholars do not believe the historical trojan #war# was so fought in the bronze age the chariot was the main battle transport weapon g the available evidence from the dendra armour and the pylos palace paintings indicate the mycenaeans used two #man# chariots with long #spear# armed principal rider unlike the three #man# hittite chariots with short #spear# armed riders and unlike the arrow armed egyptian and assyrian two #man# chariots $wise_nestor$ spearheads his troops with chariots he advises them in your eagerness to engage the $ye_trojans$ don any of you charge ahead of others trusting in your strength and horsemanship any #man# whose chariot confronts an enemy should thrust with his #spear# at him from there that the most effective tactic the #way# #man# wiped out city strongholds long ago their chests full of that style and spirit although $homer$ depictions are graphic it can be seen in the very end that victory in #war# is far more somber occasion where all that is lost becomes apparent on the other #hand# the funeral games are lively for the dead #man# life is celebrated this overall depiction of #war# runs contrary to many other ancient greek depictions where #war# is an aspiration for greater #glory# while the homeric poems the iliad in particular were not necessarily revered scripture of the ancient greeks they were most certainly seen as guides that were important to the intellectual understanding of any educated greek citizen this is evidenced by the fact that in the late fifth century bc it was the sign of #man# of standing to be able to recite the iliad and odyssey by #heart#
moreover it can be argued that the warfare shown in the iliad and the #way# in which it was depicted had profound and very traceable effect on greek warfare in general in particular the effect of epic literature can be broken down into three categories tactics ideology and the mindset of commanders in order to discern these effects it is necessary to take look at few examples from each of these categories much of the detailed fighting in the iliad is done by the #hero# in an orderly one on one fashion much like the odyssey there is even set ritual which must be observed in each of these conflicts for example major #hero# may encounter lesser #hero# from the opposing #side# in which case the minor #hero# is introduced threats may be exchanged and then the minor #hero# is slain the victor often strips the body of its armor and military accoutrements here is an example of this ritual and this type of one on one combat in the iliad there telamonian $ajax_telamon$ struck down the #son# of anthemion simoeisios in his stripling beauty whom once his mother descending from $ida$ bore beside the banks of simoeis when she had followed her father and mother to tend the therefore they called him simoeisios but he could not render again the #care# of his dear parents he was short lived beaten down beneath the #spear# of high hearted $ajax_telamon$ who struck him as he first came forward beside the nipple of the right #breast# and the bronze spearhead drove clean the biggest issue in reconciling the connection between the epic fighting of the iliad and later greek warfare is the phalanx or hoplite warfare seen in greek history well after $homer$ iliad
while there are discussions of soldiers arrayed in semblances of the phalanx throughout the iliad the focus of the poem on the heroic fighting as mentioned above would seem to contradict the tactics of the phalanx however the phalanx did have its heroic aspects the masculine one on one fighting of epic is manifested in phalanx fighting on the emphasis of holding one position in formation this replaces the singular heroic competition found in the iliad one example of this is the spartan tale of picked #man# fighting against picked argives in this battle of champions only two #man# are left standing for the argives and one for the spartans othryades the remaining spartan goes back to stand in his formation with mortal #wound# while the remaining two argives go back to $argos$ to report their victory thus the spartans claimed this as victory as their last #man# displayed the ultimate feat of bravery by maintaining his position in the phalanx in terms of the ideology of commanders in later greek history the iliad has an interesting effect the iliad expresses definite disdain for tactical trickery when $stern_hector$ says before he challenges the great $ajax_telamon$ i know how to storm my #way# into the struggle of flying horses know how to tread the measures on the grim floor of the #war# #god# yet great as you are would not strike you by stealth watching for my chance but openly so if perhaps might hit you however despite examples of disdain for this tactical trickery there is reason to believe that the iliad as well as later greek warfare endorsed tactical genius on the #part# of their commanders
for example there are multiple passages in the iliad with commanders such as agamemnon or $wise_nestor$ discussing the arraying of troops so as to gain an advantage indeed the trojan #war# is won by notorious example of greek guile in the trojan horse this is even later referred to by $homer$ in the odyssey the connection in this case between guileful tactics of the greeks in the iliad and those of the later greeks is not difficult one to find spartan commanders often seen as the pinnacle of greek military prowess were known for their tactical trickery and for them this was feat to be desired in commander indeed this type of leadership was the standard advice of greek tactical writers ultimately while homeric or epic fighting is certainly not completely replicated in later greek warfare many of its ideals tactics and instruction are hans van wees argues that the period that the descriptions of warfare relate can be pinned down fairly specificallyâ to the first half of the century bc influence on the #art# and literature main article trojan #war# in popular culture the iliad was standard work of great importance already in classical greece and remained so throughout the hellenistic and byzantine periods subjects from the trojan #war# were favourite among ancient greek dramatists aeschylus trilogy the oresteia comprising agamemnon the libation bearers and the eumenides follows the story of agamemnon after his return from the #war# $homer$ also came to be of great influence in european culture with the resurgence of interest in greek antiquity during the renaissance and it remains the first and most influential work of the western canon in its full form the text made its return to italy and western europe beginning in the century primarily through translations into latin and the vernacular languages
prior to this reintroduction however shortened latin version of the poem known as the ilias latina was very widely studied and read as basic school text the west tended to view $homer$ as unreliable as they believed they possessed much more down to #earth# and realistic eyewitness accounts of the trojan #war# written by dares and dictys cretensis who were supposedly present at the events these late antique forged accounts formed the basis of several eminently popular medieval chivalric romances most notably those of benoã de sainte maure and guido delle colonne these in turn spawned many others in various european languages such as the first printed english book the recuyell of the historyes of troye other accounts read in the middle ages were antique latin retellings such as the excidium troiae and works in the vernaculars such as the icelandic $troy$ saga even without $homer$ the trojan #war# story had remained central to western european medieval literary culture and its sense of identity most nations and several royal houses traced their origins to #hero# at the trojan #war# britain was supposedly settled by the trojan brutus for instance william shakespeare used the plot of the iliad as source material for his play troilus and cressida but focused on medieval legend the love story of troilus #son# of #king# $priam$ of $troy$ and cressida daughter of the trojan soothsayer calchas the play often considered to be comedy reverses traditional views on events of the trojan #war# and depicts $achilles$ as coward $ajax_telamon$ as dull unthinking mercenary etc william theed the elder made an impressive bronze statue of thetis as she brought $achilles$ his new armor forged by hephaesthus it has been on display in the metropolitan museum of #art# in new york city since
