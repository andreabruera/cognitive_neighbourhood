I GO TO STYLES The intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the time as <div class="bookquote">``The Styles Case''  (<font color='red'><b>the public</b></font>)</div>has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless, in view of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked, both by my friend Poirot and the family themselves, to write an account of the whole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the sensational rumours which still persist. I will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my being connected with the affair. I had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending some months in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was given a month's sick leave. Having no near relations or friends, I was trying to make up my mind what to do, when I ran across John Cavendish. I had seen very little of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) for some years. Indeed, I had never known him (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) particularly well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) was a good fifteen years my senior, for one thing, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) hardly looked his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) forty-five years. As a boy, though, I had often stayed at Styles, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) mother's place in Essex.
<p/>We had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) inviting me down to Styles to spend my leave there. <div class="bookquote">``The mater will be delighted to see you again--after all those years,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) added. <div class="bookquote">``Your mother keeps well? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. '' Oh, yes. I suppose you know that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has married again? '' I am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly. Mrs. Cavendish, who had married John's father when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was a widower with two sons, had been a handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) certainly could not be a day less than seventy now. I recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as an energetic, autocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social notoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady Bountiful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable fortune of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) own. Their country-place, Styles Court, had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish early in their married life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) had been completely under his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) wife's ascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) left the place to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lifetime, as well as the larger part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) income; an arrangement that was distinctly unfair to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) two sons. Their step-mother, however, had always been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the time of their father's remarriage that they always thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as their own mother. Lawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) had qualified as a doctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at home while pursuing literary ambitions; though his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) verses never had any marked success. John practiced for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled down to the more congenial life of a country squire.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) had married two years ago, and had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) wife to live at Styles, though I entertained a shrewd suspicion that he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) would have preferred his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) mother to increase his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) allowance, which would have enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) to have a home of his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) own. Mrs. Cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) own plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this case she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings. John noticed my surprise at the news of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother's remarriage and smiled rather ruefully. '' Rotten little bounder too!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said savagely. <div class="bookquote">``I can tell you, Hastings, it's making life jolly difficult for us. As for Evie--you remember Evie?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) was after your time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>)'s the mater's factotum, companion, Jack of all trades! A great sport--old Evie! Not precisely young and beautiful, but as game as they make them.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You were going to say--?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, this fellow! He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a second cousin or something of Evie's, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) didn't seem particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. The fellow is an absolute outsider, anyone can see that. He (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>)'s got a great black beard, and wears patent leather boots in all weathers! But the mater cottoned to him (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) at once, took him (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) on as secretary--you know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>)'s always running a hundred societies? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I nodded. '' Well, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. No doubt the fellow was very useful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>). But you could have knocked us all down with a feather when, three months ago, she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) suddenly announced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) and Alfred were engaged! The fellow must be at least twenty years younger than she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) is!
<p/>It's simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but there you are-- she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) is her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) own mistress, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>)'s married him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``It must be a difficult situation for you all.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Difficult! It's damnable!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Thus it came about that, three days later, I descended from the train at Styles St. Mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason for existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country lanes. John Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out to the car. '' Got a drop or two of petrol still, you see,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) remarked. '' Mainly owing to the mater's activities. '' The village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from the little station, and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it. It was a still, warm day in early July. As one looked out over the flat Essex country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it seemed almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great war was running its appointed course. I felt I had suddenly strayed into another world. As we turned in at the lodge gates, John said: <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid you'll find it very quiet down here, Hastings.''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, that's just what I want.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. I drill with the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. My wife works regularly `on the land'. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is up at five every morning to milk, and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. It's a jolly good life taking it all round--if it weren't for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) checked the car suddenly, and glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder if we've time to pick up Cynthia.
<p/>No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)'ll have started from the hospital by now.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cynthia! That's not your wife?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Cynthia is a protegee of my mother's, the daughter of an old schoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. He (<font color='blue'><b>solicitor</b></font>) came a cropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. My mother came to the rescue, and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) works in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster, seven miles away.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Hospital</b></font>) spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house. A lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed, straightened herself at our approach. '' Hullo, Evie, here's our wounded hero! Mr. Hastings--Miss Howard.'' Miss Howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip. I had an impression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) was a pleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly in its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with feet to match--these last encased in good thick boots. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) conversation, I soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style. <div class="bookquote">``Weeds grow like house afire. Can't keep even with 'em. Shall press you in. Better be careful.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I responded. <div class="bookquote">``Don't say it. Never does. Wish you hadn't later.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're a cynic, Evie,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>said John, laughing. '' Where's tea to-day--inside or out?'' <div class="bookquote">``Out. Too fine a day to be cooped up in the house.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come on then, you've done enough gardening for to-day. ' The labourer is worthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) hire', you know. Come and be refreshed.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Howard</b></font>)</div>said Miss Howard, drawing off her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) gardening gloves, <div class="bookquote">``I'm inclined to agree with you. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Howard</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade of a large sycamore. A figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to meet us. '' My wife, Hastings,'' said John. I shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) tall, slender form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of slumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful tawny eyes of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman's that I have ever known; the intense power of stillness she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) possessed, which nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in an exquisitely civilised body--all these things are burnt into my memory. I shall never forget them. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear voice, and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I had accepted John's invitation. Mrs. Cavendish gave me some tea, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) as a thoroughly fascinating woman. An appreciative listener is always stimulating, and I described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents of my Convalescent Home, in a way which, I flatter myself, greatly amused my hostess. John, of course, good fellow though he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is, could hardly be called a brilliant conversationalist. At that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open French window near at hand: <div class="bookquote">``Then you'll write to the Princess after tea, Alfred? I'll write to Lady Tadminster for the second day, myself. Or shall we wait until we hear from the Princess? In case of a refusal, Lady Tadminster might open it the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second. Then there's the Duchess--about the school fete.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>There was the murmur of a man's voice, and then Mrs. Inglethorp's rose in reply: '' Yes, certainly. After tea will do quite well. You are so thoughtful, Alfred dear. '' The French window swung open a little wider, and a handsome white-haired old lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features, stepped out of it on to the lawn. A man followed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), a suggestion of deference in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner. Mrs. Inglethorp greeted me with effusion. <div class="bookquote">``Why, if it isn't too delightful to see you again, Mr. Hastings, after all these years. Alfred, darling, Mr. Hastings--my husband. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked with some curiosity at <div class="bookquote">``Alfred darling'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) certainly struck a rather alien note. I did not wonder at John objecting to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) beard. It was one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wore gold-rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature. It struck me that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) might look natural on a stage, but was strangely out of place in real life. His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) voice was rather deep and unctuous. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) placed a wooden hand in mine and said: <div class="bookquote">``This is a pleasure, Mr. Hastings.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Then, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hastings</b></font>) wife: <div class="bookquote">``Emily dearest, I think that cushion is a little damp.''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) beamed fondly on him (<font color='blue'><b>Hastings</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hastings</b></font>) substituted another with every demonstration of the tenderest care. Strange infatuation of an otherwise sensible woman! With the presence of Mr. Inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiled hostility seemed to settle down upon the company. Miss Howard, in particular, took no pains to conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) feelings. Mrs. Inglethorp, however, seemed to notice nothing unusual.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) volubility, which I remembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) poured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of the forthcoming bazaar which she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) was organizing and which was to take place shortly. Occasionally she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) referred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) husband over a question of days or dates. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) watchful and attentive manner never varied. From the very first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and I flatter myself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd. Presently Mrs. Inglethorp turned to give some instructions about letters to Evelyn Howard, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) husband addressed me in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) painstaking voice: <div class="bookquote">``Is soldiering your regular profession, Mr. Hastings?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, before the war I was in Lloyd's.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And you will return there after it is over?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps. Either that or a fresh start altogether. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Cavendish</b></font>)</div>Mary Cavendish leant forward. <div class="bookquote">``What would you really choose as a profession, if you could just consult your inclination?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, that depends.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No secret hobby? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) asked. '' Tell me--you're drawn to something? Every one is--usually something absurd.'' <div class="bookquote">``You'll laugh at me.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) smiled. '' Perhaps.'' <div class="bookquote">``Well, I've always had a secret hankering to be a detective!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The real thing--Scotland Yard? Or Sherlock Holmes?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sherlock Holmes by all means. But really, seriously, I am awfully drawn to it. I came across a man in Belgium once, a very famous detective, and he (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) quite inflamed me. He (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) was a marvellous little fellow. He (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of method. My system is based on his (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>)--though of course I have progressed rather further. He (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) was a funny little man, a great dandy, but wonderfully clever.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Like a good detective story myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Howard</b></font>)</div>remarked Miss Howard. <div class="bookquote">``Lots of nonsense written, though.
<p/>Criminal discovered in last chapter. Every one dumbfounded. Real crime--you'd know at once.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There have been a great number of undiscovered crimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I argued. <div class="bookquote">``Don't mean the police, but the people that are right in it. The family. You couldn't really hoodwink them. They'd know.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, much amused, <div class="bookquote">``you think that if you were mixed up in a crime, say a murder, you'd be able to spot the murderer right off?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course I should. Mightn't be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers. But I'm certain I'd know. I'd feel it in my fingertips if he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) came near me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It might be a `she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>),'''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I suggested. <div class="bookquote">``Might. But murder's a violent crime. Associate it more with a man.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not in a case of poisoning.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Cavendish's clear voice startled me. '' Dr. Bauerstein was saying yesterday that, owing to the general ignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession, there were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected.'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, Mary, what a gruesome conversation!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Inglethorp/Inglethorp</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Inglethorp. <div class="bookquote">``It makes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave. Oh, there's Cynthia!''  (<font color='red'><b>A girl</b></font>)</div>A young girl in V. A. D. uniform ran lightly across the lawn. '' Why, Cynthia, you are late to-day. This is Mr. Hastings--Miss Murdoch. '' Cynthia Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and vigour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Murdoch</b></font>) tossed off her (<font color='blue'><b>Murdoch</b></font>) little V. A. D. cap, and I admired the great loose waves of her (<font color='blue'><b>Murdoch</b></font>) auburn hair, and the smallness and whiteness of the hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Murdoch</b></font>) held out to claim her (<font color='blue'><b>Murdoch</b></font>) tea. With dark eyes and eyelashes she (<font color='blue'><b>Murdoch</b></font>) would have been a beauty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Murdoch</b></font>) flung herself down on the ground beside John, and as I handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Murdoch</b></font>) a plate of sandwiches she (<font color='blue'><b>Murdoch</b></font>) smiled up at me. ''
<p/>Sit down here on the grass, do. It's ever so much nicer. '' I dropped down obediently. <div class="bookquote">``You work at Tadminster, don't you, Miss Murdoch?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Murdoch</b></font>) nodded. '' For my sins.'' <div class="bookquote">``Do they bully you, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to see them!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>cried Cynthia with dignity. <div class="bookquote">``I have got a cousin who is nursing,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked. '' And she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is terrified of `Sisters'. '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't wonder. Sisters are , you know, Mr. Hastings. They simp--ly are ! You've no idea! But I'm not a nurse, thank heaven, I work in the dispensary.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How many people do you poison? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, smiling. Cynthia smiled too. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, hundreds!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Cynthia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Inglethorp/Inglethorp</b></font>)</div>called Mrs. Inglethorp, <div class="bookquote">``do you think you could write a few notes for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Inglethorp/Inglethorp</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, Aunt Emily. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) jumped up promptly, and something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) manner reminded me that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) position was a dependent one, and that Mrs. Inglethorp, kind as she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) might be in the main, did not allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) to forget it. My hostess turned to me. '' John will show you your room. Supper is at half-past seven. We have given up late dinner for some time now. Lady Tadminster, our Member's wife--she (<font color='blue'><b>Tadminster</b></font>) was the late Lord Abbotsbury's daughter--does the same. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tadminster</b></font>) agrees with me that one must set an example of economy. We are quite a war household; nothing is wasted here--every scrap of waste paper, even, is saved and sent away in sacks. '' I expressed my appreciation, and John took me into the house and up the broad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different wings of the building. My room was in the left wing, and looked out over the park.
<p/>John left me, and a few minutes later I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) from my window walking slowly across the grass arm in arm with Cynthia Murdoch. I heard Mrs. Inglethorp call <div class="bookquote">``Cynthia''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Inglethorp/Inglethorp</b></font>)</div>impatiently, and the girl started and ran back to the house. At the same moment, a man stepped out from the shadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked about forty, very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face. Some violent emotion seemed to be mastering him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked up at my window as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed, and I recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had changed much in the fifteen years that had elapsed since we last met. It was John's younger brother, Lawrence Cavendish. I wondered what it was that had brought that singular expression to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) face. Then I dismissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) from my mind, and returned to the contemplation of my own affairs. The evening passed pleasantly enough; and I dreamed that night of that enigmatical woman, Mary Cavendish. The next morning dawned bright and sunny, and I was full of the anticipation of a delightful visit. I did not see Mrs. Cavendish until lunch-time, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) volunteered to take me for a walk, and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the woods, returning to the house about five. As we entered the large hall, John beckoned us both into the smoking-room. I saw at once by his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) face that something disturbing had occurred. We followed him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) in, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shut the door after us. '' Look here, Mary, there's the deuce of a mess. Evie's had a row with Alfred Inglethorp, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>)'s off.'' <div class="bookquote">``Evie? Off?''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>John nodded gloomily. '' Yes; you see she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) went to the mater, and-- Oh, here's Evie herself. '' Miss Howard entered.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) lips were set grimly together, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) carried a small suit-case. She (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) looked excited and determined, and slightly on the defensive. '' At any rate,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) burst out, <div class="bookquote">``I've spoken my mind!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My dear Evelyn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Cavendish, <div class="bookquote">``this can't be true!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>Miss Howard nodded grimly. '' True enough! Afraid I said some things to Emily she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) won't forget or forgive in a hurry. Don't mind if they've only sunk in a bit. Probably water off a duck's back, though. I said right out: `You're an old woman, Emily, and there's no fool like an old fool. The man's twenty years younger than you, and don't you fool yourself as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) married you for. Money! Well, don't let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) have too much of it. Farmer Raikes has got a very pretty young wife. Just ask your Alfred how much time he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) spends over there.' She (<font color='blue'><b>Raikes</b></font>) was very angry. Natural! I went on, `I'm going to warn you, whether you like it or not. That man would as soon murder you in your bed as look at you. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a bad lot. You can say what you like to me, but remember what I've told you. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a bad lot!''' <div class="bookquote">``What did she (<font color='blue'><b>Raikes</b></font>) say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Howard</b></font>)</div>Miss Howard made an extremely expressive grimace. ''' Darling Alfred'--`dearest Alfred'--`wicked calumnies'--`wicked lies'--`wicked woman'--to accuse her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) `dear husband'! The sooner I left her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) house the better. So I'm off.'' <div class="bookquote">``But not now?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This minute!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>For a moment we sat and stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Finally John Cavendish, finding his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) persuasions of no avail, went off to look up the trains. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) wife followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>), murmuring something about persuading Mrs. Inglethorp to think better of it. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) left the room, Miss Howard's face changed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) leant towards me eagerly. '' Mr. Hastings, you're honest.
<p/>I can trust you? '' I was a little startled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) hand on my arm, and sank her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) voice to a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``Look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>), Mr. Hastings. My poor Emily. They're a lot of sharks--all of them. Oh, I know what I'm talking about. There isn't one of them that's not hard up and trying to get money out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>). I've protected her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) as much as I could. Now I'm out of the way, they'll impose upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course, Miss Howard,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``I'll do everything I can, but I'm sure you're excited and overwrought. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) interrupted me by slowly shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) forefinger. '' Young man, trust me. I've lived in the world rather longer than you have. All I ask you is to keep your eyes open. You'll see what I mean. '' The throb of the motor came through the open window, and Miss Howard rose and moved to the door. John's voice sounded outside. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) hand on the handle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) head over her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) shoulder, and beckoned to me. '' Above all, Mr. Hastings, watch that devil--her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) husband! '' There was no time for more. Miss Howard was swallowed up in an eager chorus of protests and good-byes. The Inglethorps did not appear. As the motor drove away, Mrs. Cavendish suddenly detached herself from the group, and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall bearded man who had been evidently making for the house. The colour rose in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) cheeks as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Who is that? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked sharply, for instinctively I distrusted the man. <div class="bookquote">``That's Dr. Bauerstein,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>said John shortly. <div class="bookquote">``And who is Dr. Bauerstein?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'s staying in the village doing a rest cure, after a bad nervous breakdown.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'s a London specialist; a very clever man--one of the greatest living experts on poisons, I believe.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a great friend of Mary's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)</div>put in Cynthia, the irrepressible. John Cavendish frowned and changed the subject. '' Come for a stroll, Hastings. This has been a most rotten business. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) always had a rough tongue, but there is no stauncher friend in England than Evelyn Howard.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) took the path through the plantation, and we walked down to the village through the woods which bordered one side of the estate. As we passed through one of the gates on our way home again, a pretty young woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and smiled. <div class="bookquote">``That's a pretty girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked appreciatively. John's face hardened. <div class="bookquote">``That is Mrs. Raikes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The one that Miss Howard--''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>said John, with rather unnecessary abruptness. I thought of the white-haired old lady in the big house, and that vivid wicked little face that had just smiled into ours, and a vague chill of foreboding crept over me. I brushed it aside. <div class="bookquote">``Styles is really a glorious old place,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said to John. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) nodded rather gloomily. '' Yes, it's a fine property. It'll be mine some day--should be mine now by rights, if my father had only made a decent will. And then I shouldn't be so damned hard up as I am now.'' <div class="bookquote">``Hard up, are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My dear Hastings, I don't mind telling you that I'm at my wits' end for money.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't your brother help you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Lawrence? He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>)'s gone through every penny he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) ever had, publishing rotten verses in fancy bindings. No, we're an impecunious lot. My mother's always been awfully good to us, I must say. That is, up to now.
<p/>Since her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) marriage, of course--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) broke off, frowning. For the first time I felt that, with Evelyn Howard, something indefinable had gone from the atmosphere. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) presence had spelt security. Now that security was removed--and the air seemed rife with suspicion. The sinister face of Dr. Bauerstein recurred to me unpleasantly. A vague suspicion of every one and everything filled my mind. Just for a moment I had a premonition of approaching evil. CHAPTER II. THE 16TH AND 17TH OF JULY I had arrived at Styles on the 5th of July. I come now to the events of the 16th and 17th of that month. For the convenience of the reader I will recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner as possible. They were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of long and tedious cross-examinations. I received a letter from Evelyn Howard a couple of days after her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) departure, telling me she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) was working as a nurse at the big hospital in Middlingham, a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away, and begging me to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) know if Mrs. Inglethorp should show any wish to be reconciled. The only fly in the ointment of my peaceful days was Mrs. Cavendish's extraordinary, and, for my part, unaccountable preference for the society of Dr. Bauerstein. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) saw in the man I cannot imagine, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) was always asking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up to the house, and often went off for long expeditions with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I must confess that I was quite unable to see his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attraction. The 16th of July fell on a Monday. It was a day of turmoil.
<p/>The famous bazaar had taken place on Saturday, and an entertainment, in connection with the same charity, at which Mrs. Inglethorp was to recite a War poem, was to be held that night. We were all busy during the morning arranging and decorating the Hall in the village where it was to take place. We had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the garden. I noticed that John's manner was somewhat unusual. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) seemed very excited and restless. After tea, Mrs. Inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) efforts in the evening and I challenged Mary Cavendish to a single at tennis. About a quarter to seven, Mrs. Inglethorp called us that we should be late as supper was early that night. We had rather a scramble to get ready in time; and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at the door. The entertainment was a great success, Mrs. Inglethorp's recitation receiving tremendous applause. There were also some tableaux in which Cynthia took part. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) did not return with us, having been asked to a supper party, and to remain the night with some friends who had been acting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) in the tableaux. The following morning, Mrs. Inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) was rather overtired; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) appeared in her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) briskest mood about 12.30, and swept Lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party. '' Such a charming invitation from Mrs. Rolleston. Lady Tadminster's sister, you know. The Rollestons came over with the Conqueror--one of our oldest families. '' Mary had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with Dr. Bauerstein.
<p/>We had a pleasant luncheon, and as we drove away Lawrence suggested that we should return by Tadminster, which was barely a mile out of our way, and pay a visit to Cynthia in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) dispensary. Mrs. Inglethorp replied that this was an excellent idea, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) had several letters to write she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) would drop us there, and we could come back with Cynthia in the pony-trap. We were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter, until Cynthia appeared to vouch for us, looking very cool and sweet in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) long white overall. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) took us up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sanctum, and introduced us to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) fellow dispenser, a rather awe-inspiring individual, whom Cynthia cheerily addressed as <div class="bookquote">``Nibs.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What a lot of bottles! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed, as my eye travelled round the small room. <div class="bookquote">``Do you really know what's in them all?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Say something original,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>groaned Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``Every single person who comes up here says that. We are really thinking of bestowing a prize on the first individual who does not say: `What a lot of bottles!' And I know the next thing you're going to say is: `How many people have you poisoned?' ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pleaded guilty with a laugh. <div class="bookquote">``If you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by mistake, you wouldn't joke about it. Come on, let's have tea. We've got all sorts of secret stories in that cupboard. No, Lawrence--that's the poison cupboard. The big cupboard--that's right. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>We had a very cheery tea, and assisted Cynthia to wash up afterwards. We had just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door. The countenances of Cynthia and Nibs were suddenly petrified into a stern and forbidding expression. <div class="bookquote">``Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, in a sharp professional tone.
<p/>A young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) proffered to Nibs, who waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) towards Cynthia with the somewhat enigmatical remark: '' I 'm not really here to-day.'' Cynthia took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge. <div class="bookquote">``This should have been sent up this morning.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sister is very sorry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) forgot.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sister should read the rules outside the door. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gathered from the little nurse's expression that there was not the least likelihood of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) having the hardihood to retail this message to the dreaded <div class="bookquote">``Sister'' (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>. <div class="bookquote">``So now it can't be done until to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>finished Cynthia. '' Don't you think you could possibly let us have it to-night?'' <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia graciously, <div class="bookquote">``we are very busy, but if we have time it shall be done. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>The little nurse withdrew, and Cynthia promptly took a jar from the shelf, refilled the bottle, and placed it on the table outside the door. I laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Discipline must be maintained?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Exactly. Come out on our little balcony. You can see all the outside wards there. '' I followed Cynthia and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) friend and they pointed out the different wards to me. Lawrence remained behind, but after a few moments Cynthia called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) over her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) shoulder to come and join us. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing more to do, Nibs?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' All right. Then we can lock up and go. '' I had seen Lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon. Compared to John, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was the opposite of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brother in almost every respect, being unusually shy and reserved.
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had a certain charm of manner, and I fancied that, if one really knew him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) well, one could have a deep affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). I had always fancied that his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) manner to Cynthia was rather constrained, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) side was inclined to be shy of him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). But they were both gay enough this afternoon, and chatted together like a couple of children. As we drove through the village, I remembered that I wanted some stamps, so accordingly we pulled up at the post office. As I came out again, I cannoned into a little man who was just entering. I drew aside and apologised, when suddenly, with a loud exclamation, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clasped me in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms and kissed me warmly. '' Mon ami Hastings!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``It is indeed mon ami Hastings!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Poirot!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed. I turned to the pony-trap. <div class="bookquote">``This is a very pleasant meeting for me, Miss Cynthia. This is my old friend, Monsieur Poirot, whom I have not seen for years.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, we know Monsieur Poirot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia gaily. <div class="bookquote">``But I had no idea he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was a friend of yours.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot seriously. <div class="bookquote">``I know Mademoiselle Cynthia. It is by the charity of that good Mrs. Inglethorp that I am here.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Then, as I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) inquiringly: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, my friend, she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) had kindly extended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who, alas, are refugees from their native land. We Belgians will always remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) with gratitude. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Poirot was an extraordinary looking little man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was hardly more than five feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. His (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) head was exactly the shape of an egg, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) always perched it a little on one side. His (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) moustache was very stiff and military.
<p/>The neatness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) attire was almost incredible. I believe a speck of dust would have caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified little man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) time one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police. As a detective, his (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) flair had been extraordinary, and he (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) had achieved triumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day. He (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) fellow Belgians, and I promised to go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) at an early date. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) hat with a flourish to Cynthia, and we drove away. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>)'s a dear little man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``I'd no idea you knew him (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You've been entertaining a celebrity unawares,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied. And, for the rest of the way home, I recited to them the various exploits and triumphs of Hercule Poirot. We arrived back in a very cheerful mood. As we entered the hall, Mrs. Inglethorp came out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) boudoir. She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) looked flushed and upset. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Is there anything the matter, Aunt Emily? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>asked Cynthia. '' Certainly not,'' said Mrs. Inglethorp sharply. <div class="bookquote">``What should there be?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorcas/Mademoiselle Dorcas</b></font>)</div>Then catching sight of Dorcas, the parlourmaid, going into the dining-room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) called to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) to bring some stamps into the boudoir. '' Yes, m'm. '' The old servant hesitated, then added diffidently: <div class="bookquote">``Don't you think, m'm, you'd better get to bed? You're looking very tired.''  (<font color='red'><b>The servant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you're right, Dorcas--yes--no--not now. I've some letters I must finish by post-time. Have you lighted the fire in my room as I told you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, m'm.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll go to bed directly after supper.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) went into the boudoir again, and Cynthia stared after her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Goodness gracious! I wonder what's up?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said to Lawrence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) did not seem to have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), for without a word he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) heel and went out of the house. I suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and, Cynthia agreeing, I ran upstairs to fetch my racquet. Mrs. Cavendish was coming down the stairs. It may have been my fancy, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>), too, was looking odd and disturbed. '' Had a good walk with Dr. Bauerstein? '' I asked, trying to appear as indifferent as I could. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) replied abruptly. '' Where is Mrs. Inglethorp?'' <div class="bookquote">``In the boudoir. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) hand clenched itself on the banisters, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) seemed to nerve herself for some encounter, and went rapidly past me down the stairs across the hall to the boudoir, the door of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) shut behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>). As I ran out to the tennis court a few moments later, I had to pass the open boudoir window, and was unable to help overhearing the following scrap of dialogue. Mary Cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman desperately controlling herself: <div class="bookquote">``Then you won't show it to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>To which Mrs. Inglethorp replied: <div class="bookquote">``My dear Mary, it has nothing to do with that matter.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Inglethorp/Inglethorp</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then show it to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I tell you it is not what you imagine. It does not concern you in the least.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Cavendish</b></font>)</div>To which Mary Cavendish replied, with a rising bitterness: <div class="bookquote">``Of course, I might have known you would shield him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Cavendish</b></font>)</div>Cynthia was waiting for me, and greeted me eagerly with: <div class="bookquote">``I say! There's been the most awful row! I've got it all out of Dorcas.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What kind of a row?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Between Aunt Emily and him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) .
<p/>I do hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>)'s found him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) out at last!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Was Dorcas there, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) `happened to be near the door'. It was a real old bust-up. I do wish I knew what it was all about. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought of Mrs. Raikes's gipsy face, and Evelyn Howard's warnings, but wisely decided to hold my peace, whilst Cynthia exhausted every possible hypothesis, and cheerfully hoped, <div class="bookquote">``Aunt Emily will send him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) away, and will never speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) again. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>I was anxious to get hold of John, but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was nowhere to be seen. Evidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon. I tried to forget the few words I had overheard; but, do what I would, I could not dismiss them altogether from my mind. What was Mary Cavendish's concern in the matter? Mr. Inglethorp was in the drawing-room when I came down to supper. His (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) face was impassive as ever, and the strange unreality of the man struck me afresh. Mrs. Inglethorp came down last. She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) still looked agitated, and during the meal there was a somewhat constrained silence. Inglethorp was unusually quiet. As a rule, he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) surrounded his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) wife with little attentions, placing a cushion at her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) back, and altogether playing the part of the devoted husband. Immediately after supper, Mrs. Inglethorp retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) boudoir again. '' Send my coffee in here, Mary,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) called. <div class="bookquote">``I've just five minutes to catch the post.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>Cynthia and I went and sat by the open window in the drawing-room. Mary Cavendish brought our coffee to us. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) seemed excited. <div class="bookquote">``Do you young people want lights, or do you enjoy the twilight?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) asked. '' Will you take Mrs. Inglethorp her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) coffee, Cynthia? I will pour it out.'' <div class="bookquote">``Do not trouble, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Inglethorp/Inglethorp</b></font>)</div>said Inglethorp.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will take it to Emily.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) poured it out, and went out of the room carrying it carefully. Lawrence followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>), and Mrs. Cavendish sat down by us. We three sat for some time in silence. It was a glorious night, hot and still. Mrs. Cavendish fanned herself gently with a palm leaf. <div class="bookquote">``It's almost too hot,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``We shall have a thunderstorm.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Alas, that these harmonious moments can never endure! My paradise was rudely shattered by the sound of a well known, and heartily disliked, voice in the hall. '' Dr. Bauerstein!'' exclaimed Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``What a funny time to come. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I glanced jealously at Mary Cavendish, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) seemed quite undisturbed, the delicate pallor of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) cheeks did not vary. In a few moments, Alfred Inglethorp had ushered the doctor in, the latter laughing, and protesting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) was in no fit state for a drawing-room. In truth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) presented a sorry spectacle, being literally plastered with mud. <div class="bookquote">``What have you been doing, doctor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Cavendish. <div class="bookquote">``I must make my apologies,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor. <div class="bookquote">``I did not really mean to come in, but Mr. Inglethorp insisted.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, Bauerstein, you are in a plight,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>said John, strolling in from the hall. <div class="bookquote">``Have some coffee, and tell us what you have been up to.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, I will.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) laughed rather ruefully, as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) described how he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had discovered a very rare species of fern in an inaccessible place, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) efforts to obtain it had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) footing, and slipped ignominiously into a neighbouring pond. <div class="bookquote">``The sun soon dried me off,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``but I'm afraid my appearance is very disreputable.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At this juncture, Mrs. Inglethorp called to Cynthia from the hall, and the girl ran out. <div class="bookquote">``Just carry up my despatch-case, will you, dear?
<p/>I'm going to bed.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The door into the hall was a wide one. I had risen when Cynthia did, John was close by me. There were therefore three witnesses who could swear that Mrs. Inglethorp was carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) coffee, as yet untasted, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) hand. My evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of Dr. Bauerstein. It seemed to me the man would never go. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rose at last, however, and I breathed a sigh of relief. <div class="bookquote">``I'll walk down to the village with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Inglethorp/Alfred Inglethorp/Alfred</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Inglethorp. <div class="bookquote">``I must see our agent over those estate accounts.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) turned to John. <div class="bookquote">``No one need sit up. I will take the latch-key.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER III. THE NIGHT OF THE TRAGEDY To make this part of my story clear, I append the following plan of the first floor of Styles. The servants' rooms are reached through the door B. They have no communication with the right wing, where the Inglethorps' rooms were situated. It seemed to be the middle of the night when I was awakened by Lawrence Cavendish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) had a candle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) hand, and the agitation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) face told me at once that something was seriously wrong. <div class="bookquote">``What's the matter? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, sitting up in bed, and trying to collect my scattered thoughts. <div class="bookquote">``We are afraid my mother is very ill. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seems to be having some kind of fit. Unfortunately she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has locked herself in.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll come at once. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sprang out of bed; and, pulling on a dressing-gown, followed Lawrence along the passage and the gallery to the right wing of the house. John Cavendish joined us, and one or two of the servants were standing round in a state of awe-stricken excitement. Lawrence turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) brother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think we had better do?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Never, I thought, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) indecision of character been more apparent. John rattled the handle of Mrs. Inglethorp's door violently, but with no effect. It was obviously locked or bolted on the inside. The whole household was aroused by now. The most alarming sounds were audible from the interior of the room. Clearly something must be done. '' Try going through Mr. Inglethorp's room, sir,'' cried Dorcas. '' Oh, the poor mistress!'' Suddenly I realized that Alfred Inglethorp was not with us--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) alone had given no sign of his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) presence. John opened the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) room. It was pitch dark, but Lawrence was following with the candle, and by its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in, and that there was no sign of the room having been occupied. We went straight to the connecting door. That, too, was locked or bolted on the inside. What was to be done? '' Oh, dear, sir,'' cried Dorcas, wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) hands, <div class="bookquote">``what ever shall we do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorcas/Mademoiselle Dorcas</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We must try and break the door in, I suppose. It'll be a tough job, though. Here, let one of the maids go down and wake Baily and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) to go for Dr. Wilkins at once. Now then, we'll have a try at the door. Half a moment, though, isn't there a door into Miss Cynthia's rooms?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, but that's always bolted. It's never been undone.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, we might just see.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilkins</b></font>) ran rapidly down the corridor to Cynthia's room. Mary Cavendish was there, shaking the girl--who must have been an unusually sound sleeper--and trying to wake her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>). In a moment or two he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilkins</b></font>) was back. '' No good. That's bolted too. We must break in the door.
<p/>I think this one is a shade less solid than the one in the passage. '' We strained and heaved together. The framework of the door was solid, and for a long time it resisted our efforts, but at last we felt it give beneath our weight, and finally, with a resounding crash, it was burst open. We stumbled in together, Lawrence still holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) candle. Mrs. Inglethorp was lying on the bed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) whole form agitated by violent convulsions, in one of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) must have overturned the table beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>). As we entered, however, her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) limbs relaxed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) fell back upon the pillows. John strode across the room, and lit the gas. Turning to Annie, one of the housemaids, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) downstairs to the dining-room for brandy. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) went across to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother whilst I unbolted the door that gave on the corridor. I turned to Lawrence, to suggest that I had better leave them now that there was no further need of my services, but the words were frozen on my lips. Never have I seen such a ghastly look on any man's face. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was white as chalk, the candle he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shaking hand was sputtering onto the carpet, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, petrified with terror, or some such kindred emotion, stared fixedly over my head at a point on the further wall. It was as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen something that turned him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to stone. I instinctively followed the direction of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, but I could see nothing unusual. The still feebly flickering ashes in the grate, and the row of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece, were surely harmless enough. The violence of Mrs. Inglethorp's attack seemed to be passing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) was able to speak in short gasps. ''
<p/>Better now--very sudden--stupid of me--to lock myself in.'' A shadow fell on the bed and, looking up, I saw Mary Cavendish standing near the door with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) arm around Cynthia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) seemed to be supporting the girl, who looked utterly dazed and unlike herself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) face was heavily flushed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) yawned repeatedly. '' Poor Cynthia is quite frightened,'' said Mrs. Cavendish in a low clear voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) herself, I noticed, was dressed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) white land smock. Then it must be later than I thought. I saw that a faint streak of daylight was showing through the curtains of the windows, and that the clock on the mantelpiece pointed to close upon five o'clock. A strangled cry from the bed startled me. A fresh access of pain seized the unfortunate old lady. The convulsions were of a violence terrible to behold. Everything was confusion. We thronged round her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), powerless to help or alleviate. A final convulsion lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) from the bed, until she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) appeared to rest upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heels, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) body arched in an extraordinary manner. In vain Mary and John tried to administer more brandy. The moments flew. Again the body arched itself in that peculiar fashion. At that moment, Dr. Bauerstein pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) way authoritatively into the room. For one instant he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) stopped dead, staring at the figure on the bed, and, at the same instant, Mrs. Inglethorp cried out in a strangled voice, her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) eyes fixed on the doctor: <div class="bookquote">``Alfred--Alfred--''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) fell back motionless on the pillows. With a stride, the doctor reached the bed, and seizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) arms worked them energetically, applying what I knew to be artificial respiration. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) issued a few short sharp orders to the servants.
<p/>An imperious wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hand drove us all to the door. We watched him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), fascinated, though I think we all knew in our hearts that it was too late, and that nothing could be done now. I could see by the expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) face that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) himself had little hope. Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) abandoned his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) task, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head gravely. At that moment, we heard footsteps outside, and Dr. Wilkins, Mrs. Inglethorp's own doctor, a portly, fussy little man, came bustling in. In a few words Dr. Bauerstein explained how he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilkins</b></font>) had happened to be passing the lodge gates as the car came out, and had run up to the house as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilkins</b></font>) could, whilst the car went on to fetch Dr. Wilkins. With a faint gesture of the hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilkins</b></font>) indicated the figure on the bed. '' Ve--ry sad. Ve --ry sad,'' murmured Dr. Wilkins. '' Poor dear lady. Always did far too much--far too much--against my advice. I warned her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart was far from strong. ' Take it easy,' I said to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), `Take--it--easy'. But no--her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) zeal for good works was too great. Nature rebelled. Na-- ture--re--belled.'' Dr. Bauerstein, I noticed, was watching the local doctor narrowly. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) still kept his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) eyes fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">``The convulsions were of a peculiar violence, Dr. Wilkins. I am sorry you were not here in time to witness them. They were quite--tetanic in character.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Wilkins/Wilkins</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Wilkins wisely. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to speak to you in private,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Bauerstein/Bauerstein</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Bauerstein. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilkins</b></font>) turned to John. <div class="bookquote">``You do not object?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctors</b></font>)</div>We all trooped out into the corridor, leaving the two doctors alone, and I heard the key turned in the lock behind us. We went slowly down the stairs.
<p/>I was violently excited. I have a certain talent for deduction, and Dr. Bauerstein's manner had started a flock of wild surmises in my mind. Mary Cavendish laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) hand upon my arm. <div class="bookquote">``What is it? Why did Dr. Bauerstein seem so--peculiar? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>). '' Do you know what I think?'' <div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Listen! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked round, the others were out of earshot. I lowered my voice to a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) has been poisoned! I'm certain Dr. Bauerstein suspects it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What ? '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) shrank against the wall, the pupils of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) eyes dilating wildly. Then, with a sudden cry that startled me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) cried out: <div class="bookquote">``No, no--not that--not that!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And breaking from me, fled up the stairs. I followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>), afraid that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) was going to faint. I found her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) leaning against the bannisters, deadly pale. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) waved me away impatiently. '' No, no--leave me. I'd rather be alone. Let me just be quiet for a minute or two. Go down to the others. '' I obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) reluctantly. John and Lawrence were in the dining-room. I joined them. We were all silent, but I suppose I voiced the thoughts of us all when I at last broke it by saying: <div class="bookquote">``Where is Mr. Inglethorp?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>John shook his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) head. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'s not in the house. '' Our eyes met. Where was Alfred Inglethorp? His (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) absence was strange and inexplicable. I remembered Mrs. Inglethorp's dying words. What lay beneath them? What more could she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) have told us, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) had had time? At last we heard the doctors descending the stairs. Dr. Wilkins was looking important and excited, and trying to conceal an inward exultation under a manner of decorous calm. Dr. Bauerstein remained in the background, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilkins</b></font>) grave bearded face unchanged.
<p/>Dr. Wilkins was the spokesman for the two. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilkins</b></font>) addressed himself to John: <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Cavendish, I should like your consent to a postmortem.''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is that necessary?''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>asked John gravely. A spasm of pain crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) face. '' Absolutely,'' said Dr. Bauerstein. <div class="bookquote">``You mean by that--?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That neither Dr. Wilkins nor myself could give a death certificate under the circumstances. ''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>John bent his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) head. '' In that case, I have no alternative but to agree.'' <div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Wilkins/Wilkins</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Wilkins briskly. <div class="bookquote">``We propose that it should take place to-morrow night--or rather to-night.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilkins</b></font>) glanced at the daylight. <div class="bookquote">``Under the circumstances, I am afraid an inquest can hardly be avoided--these formalities are necessary, but I beg that you won't distress yourselves. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Bauerstein/Bauerstein</b></font>)</div>There was a pause, and then Dr. Bauerstein drew two keys from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilkins</b></font>) pocket, and handed them to John. <div class="bookquote">``These are the keys of the two rooms. I have locked them and, in my opinion, they would be better kept locked for the present. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The doctors</b></font>)</div>The doctors then departed. I had been turning over an idea in my head, and I felt that the moment had now come to broach it. Yet I was a little chary of doing so. John, I knew, had a horror of any kind of publicity, and was an easygoing optimist, who preferred never to meet trouble half-way. It might be difficult to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>optimist</b></font>) of the soundness of my plan. Lawrence, on the other hand, being less conventional, and having more imagination, I felt I might count upon as an ally. There was no doubt that the moment had come for me to take the lead. '' John,'' I said, <div class="bookquote">``I am going to ask you something.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You remember my speaking of my friend Poirot? The Belgian who is here?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) has been a most famous detective.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I want you to let me call him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) in--to investigate this matter.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What--now? Before the post-mortem?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, time is an advantage if--if--there has been foul play.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Rubbish!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lawrence/Monsieur Lawrence</b></font>)</div>cried Lawrence angrily. <div class="bookquote">``In my opinion the whole thing is a mare's nest of Bauerstein's! Wilkins hadn't an idea of such a thing, until Bauerstein put it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) head. But, like all specialists, Bauerstein's got a bee in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) bonnet. Poisons are his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) hobby, so of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) sees them everywhere. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I confess that I was surprised by Lawrence's attitude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) was so seldom vehement about anything. John hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``I can't feel as you do, Lawrence,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``I'm inclined to give Hastings a free hand, though I should prefer to wait a bit. We don't want any unnecessary scandal.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried eagerly, <div class="bookquote">``you need have no fear of that. Poirot is discretion itself.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well, then, have it your own way. I leave it in your hands. Though, if it is as we suspect, it seems a clear enough case. God forgive me if I am wronging him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked at my watch. It was six o'clock. I determined to lose no time. Five minutes' delay, however, I allowed myself. I spent it in ransacking the library until I discovered a medical book which gave a description of strychnine poisoning. CHAPTER IV. POIROT INVESTIGATES The house which the Belgians occupied in the village was quite close to the park gates. One could save time by taking a narrow path through the long grass, which cut off the detours of the winding drive. So I, accordingly, went that way. I had nearly reached the lodge, when my attention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me.
<p/>It was Mr. Inglethorp. Where had he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) been? How did he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) intend to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) absence? He (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) accosted me eagerly. '' My God! This is terrible! My poor wife! I have only just heard.'' <div class="bookquote">``Where have you been? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. '' Denby kept me late last night. It was one o'clock before we'd finished. Then I found that I'd forgotten the latch-key after all. I didn't want to arouse the household, so Denby gave me a bed.'' <div class="bookquote">``How did you hear the news? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. '' Wilkins knocked Denby up to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Denby</b></font>). My poor Emily! She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) was so self-sacrificing--such a noble character. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) over-taxed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) strength. '' A wave of revulsion swept over me. What a consummate hypocrite the man was! <div class="bookquote">``I must hurry on,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, thankful that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not ask me whither I was bound. In a few minutes I was knocking at the door of Leastways Cottage. Getting no answer, I repeated my summons impatiently. A window above me was cautiously opened, and Poirot himself looked out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) gave an exclamation of surprise at seeing me. In a few brief words, I explained the tragedy that had occurred, and that I wanted his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) help. <div class="bookquote">``Wait, my friend, I will let you in, and you shall recount to me the affair whilst I dress. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In a few moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) had unbarred the door, and I followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) room. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) installed me in a chair, and I related the whole story, keeping back nothing, and omitting no circumstance, however insignificant, whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) himself made a careful and deliberate toilet.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) of my awakening, of Mrs. Inglethorp's dying words, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) husband's absence, of the quarrel the day before, of the scrap of conversation between Mary and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mother-in-law that I had overheard, of the former quarrel between Mrs. Inglethorp and Evelyn Howard, and of the latter's innuendoes. I was hardly as clear as I could wish. I repeated myself several times, and occasionally had to go back to some detail that I had forgotten. Poirot smiled kindly on me. <div class="bookquote">``The mind is confused? Is it not so? Take time, mon ami . You are agitated; you are excited--it is but natural. Presently, when we are calmer, we will arrange the facts, neatly, each in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) proper place. We will examine--and reject. Those of importance we will put on one side; those of no importance, pouf!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) screwed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) cherub-like face, and puffed comically enough--<div class="bookquote">``blow them away!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's all very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I objected, <div class="bookquote">``but how are you going to decide what is important, and what isn't? That always seems the difficulty to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Poirot shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) head energetically. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was now arranging his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) moustache with exquisite care. '' Not so. Voyons ! One fact leads to another--so we continue. Does the next fit in with that? A merveille ! Good! We can proceed. This next little fact-- no! Ah, that is curious! There is something missing--a link in the chain that is not there. We examine. We search. And that little curious fact, that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally, we put it here!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) made an extravagant gesture with his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``It is significant! It is tremendous!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Y--es--''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) forefinger so fiercely at me that I quailed before it. '' Beware!
<p/>Peril to the detective who says: `It is so small--it does not matter. It will not agree. I will forget it.' That way lies confusion! Everything matters.'' <div class="bookquote">``I know. You always told me that. That's why I have gone into all the details of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And I am pleased with you. You have a good memory, and you have given me the facts faithfully. Of the order in which you present them, I say nothing--truly, it is deplorable! But I make allowances--you are upset. To that I attribute the circumstance that you have omitted one fact of paramount importance.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">``You have not told me if Mrs. Inglethorp ate well last night. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). Surely the war had affected the little man's brain. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was carefully engaged in brushing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coat before putting it on, and seemed wholly engrossed in the task. <div class="bookquote">``I don't remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``And, anyway, I don't see--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You do not see? But it is of the first importance.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't see why,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, rather nettled. <div class="bookquote">``As far as I can remember, she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) didn't eat much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) was obviously upset, and it had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) appetite away. That was only natural.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot thoughtfully, <div class="bookquote">``it was only natural.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) opened a drawer, and took out a small despatch-case, then turned to me. '' Now I am ready. We will proceed to the chateau, and study matters on the spot. Excuse me, mon ami , you dressed in haste, and your tie is on one side. Permit me.'' With a deft gesture, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) rearranged it. '' Ça y est! Now, shall we start? '' We hurried up the village, and turned in at the lodge gates.
<p/>Poirot stopped for a moment, and gazed sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse of park, still glittering with morning dew. '' So beautiful, so beautiful, and yet, the poor family, plunged in sorrow, prostrated with grief.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) looked at me keenly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) spoke, and I was aware that I reddened under his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) prolonged gaze. Was the family prostrated by grief? Was the sorrow at Mrs. Inglethorp's death so great? I realized that there was an emotional lack in the atmosphere. The dead woman had not the gift of commanding love. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) death was a shock and a distress, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would not be passionately regretted. Poirot seemed to follow my thoughts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) head gravely. '' No, you are right,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it is not as though there was a blood tie. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has been kind and generous to these Cavendishes, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not their own mother. Blood tells--always remember that--blood tells.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Poirot,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if Mrs. Inglethorp ate well last night? I have been turning it over in my mind, but I can't see how it has anything to do with the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was silent for a minute or two as we walked along, but finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I do not mind telling you--though, as you know, it is not my habit to explain until the end is reached. The present contention is that Mrs. Inglethorp died of strychnine poisoning, presumably administered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) coffee.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, what time was the coffee served?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``About eight o'clock.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) drank it between then and half-past eight--certainly not much later. Well, strychnine is a fairly rapid poison. Its effects would be felt very soon, probably in about an hour.
<p/>Yet, in Mrs. Inglethorp's case, the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five o'clock the next morning: nine hours! But a heavy meal, taken at about the same time as the poison, might retard its effects, though hardly to that extent. Still, it is a possibility to be taken into account. But, according to you, she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) ate very little for supper, and yet the symptoms do not develop until early the next morning! Now that is a curious circumstance, my friend. Something may arise at the autopsy to explain it. In the meantime, remember it.''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>As we neared the house, John came out and met us. His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) face looked weary and haggard. <div class="bookquote">``This is a very dreadful business, Monsieur Poirot,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Hastings has explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I comprehend perfectly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You see, it is only suspicion so far. We have nothing to go upon.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Precisely. It is a matter of precaution only. '' John turned to me, taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) cigarette-case, and lighting a cigarette as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did so. <div class="bookquote">``You know that fellow Inglethorp is back?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. I met him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).'' John flung the match into an adjacent flower bed, a proceeding which was too much for Poirot's feelings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) retrieved it, and buried it neatly. <div class="bookquote">``It's jolly difficult to know how to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That difficulty will not exist long,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>pronounced Poirot quietly. John looked puzzled, not quite understanding the portent of this cryptic saying. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) handed the two keys which Dr. Bauerstein had given him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to me. '' Show Monsieur Poirot everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) wants to see.'' <div class="bookquote">``The rooms are locked? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>asked Poirot. '' Dr. Bauerstein considered it advisable.'' Poirot nodded thoughtfully. '' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) is very sure. Well, that simplifies matters for us.
<p/>'' We went up together to the room of the tragedy. For convenience I append a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in it. Poirot locked the door on the inside, and proceeded to a minute inspection of the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) darted from one object to the other with the agility of a grasshopper. I remained by the door, fearing to obliterate any clues. Poirot, however, did not seem grateful to me for my forbearance. <div class="bookquote">``What have you, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``that you remain there like--how do you say it?--ah, yes, the stuck pig? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I explained that I was afraid of obliterating any foot-marks. '' Foot-marks? But what an idea! There has already been practically an army in the room! What foot-marks are we likely to find? No, come here and aid me in my search. I will put down my little case until I need it.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did so, on the round table by the window, but it was an ill-advised proceeding; for, the top of it being loose, it tilted up, and precipitated the despatch-case on the floor. '' Eh voil une table! '' cried Poirot. '' Ah, my friend, one may live in a big house and yet have no comfort.'' After which piece of moralizing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) search. A small purple despatch-case, with a key in the lock, on the writing-table, engaged his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) attention for some time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) took out the key from the lock, and passed it to me to inspect. I saw nothing peculiar, however. It was an ordinary key of the Yale type, with a bit of twisted wire through the handle. Next, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) examined the framework of the door we had broken in, assuring himself that the bolt had really been shot.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) went to the door opposite leading into Cynthia's room. That door was also bolted, as I had stated. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) went to the length of unbolting it, and opening and shutting it several times; this he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) did with the utmost precaution against making any noise. Suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed to rivet his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) examined it carefully, and then, nimbly whipping out a pair of small forceps from his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) drew out some minute particle which he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope. On the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small saucepan on it. A small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the saucepan, and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood near it. I wondered how I could have been so unobservant as to overlook this. Here was a clue worth having. Poirot delicately dipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) finger into liquid, and tasted it gingerly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) made a grimace. '' Cocoa--with--I think--rum in it.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) passed on to the debris on the floor, where the table by the bed had been overturned. A reading-lamp, some books, matches, a bunch of keys, and the crushed fragments of a coffee-cup lay scattered about. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, this is curious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot. <div class="bookquote">``I must confess that I see nothing particularly curious about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You do not? Observe the lamp--the chimney is broken in two places; they lie there as they fell. But see, the coffee-cup is absolutely smashed to powder.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said wearily, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose someone must have stepped on it.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot, in an odd voice. <div class="bookquote">``Someone stepped on it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) knees, and walked slowly across to the mantelpiece, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments, and straightening them--a trick of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was agitated. '' Mon ami ,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said, turning to me, <div class="bookquote">``somebody stepped on that cup, grinding it to powder, and the reason they did so was either because it contained strychnine or--which is far more serious--because it did not contain strychnine! ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I made no reply. I was bewildered, but I knew that it was no good asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) to explain. In a moment or two he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) roused himself, and went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) investigations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) picked up the bunch of keys from the floor, and twirling them round in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) fingers finally selected one, very bright and shining, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) tried in the lock of the purple despatch-case. It fitted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) opened the box, but after a moment's hesitation, closed and relocked it, and slipped the bunch of keys, as well as the key that had originally stood in the lock, into his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) own pocket. <div class="bookquote">``I have no authority to go through these papers. But it should be done--at once!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the wash-stand. Crossing the room to the left-hand window, a round stain, hardly visible on the dark brown carpet, seemed to interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) particularly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) went down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) knees, examining it minutely--even going so far as to smell it. Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube, sealing it <div class="bookquote">``We have found in this room,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said, writing busily, <div class="bookquote">``six points of interest. Shall I enumerate them, or will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied hastily. '' Very well, then.
<p/>One, a coffee-cup that has been ground into powder; two, a despatch-case with a key in the lock; three, a stain on the floor.'' <div class="bookquote">``That may have been done some time ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interrupted. <div class="bookquote">``No, for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee. Four, a fragment of some dark green fabric--only a thread or two, but recognizable.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried. <div class="bookquote">``That was what you sealed up in the envelope.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. It may turn out to be a piece of one of Mrs. Inglethorp's own dresses, and quite unimportant. We shall see. Five, this !'' With a dramatic gesture, he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the floor by the writing-table. <div class="bookquote">``It must have been done since yesterday, otherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with blotting-paper and a hot iron. One of my best hats once--but that is not to the point.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was very likely done last night. We were very agitated. Or perhaps Mrs. Inglethorp herself dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) candle.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You brought only one candle into the room?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. Lawrence Cavendish was carrying it. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) was very upset. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) seemed to see something over here''--I indicated the mantelpiece--<div class="bookquote">``that absolutely paralysed him (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is interesting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is suggestive'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) eye sweeping the whole length of the wall--<div class="bookquote">``but it was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) candle that made this great patch, for you perceive that this is white grease; whereas Monsieur Lawrence's candle, which is still on the dressing-table, is pink. On the other hand, Mrs. Inglethorp had no candlestick in the room, only a reading-lamp.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``what do you deduce?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>To which my friend only made a rather irritating reply, urging me to use my own natural faculties. '' And the sixth point? '' I asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it is the sample of cocoa.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``I might have included that in the six, but I did not. No, the sixth point I will keep to myself for the present. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) looked quickly round the room. <div class="bookquote">``There is nothing more to be done here, I think, unless'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes in the grate. '' The fire burns--and it destroys. But by chance--there might be--let us see!'' Deftly, on hands and knees, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) began to sort the ashes from the grate into the fender, handling them with the greatest caution. Suddenly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) gave a faint exclamation. '' The forceps, Hastings! '' I quickly handed them to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hastings</b></font>), and with skill he (<font color='blue'><b>Hastings</b></font>) extracted a small piece of half charred paper. <div class="bookquote">``There, mon ami! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hastings</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``What do you think of that? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I scrutinized the fragment. This is an exact reproduction of it:-- I was puzzled. It was unusually thick, quite unlike ordinary notepaper. Suddenly an idea struck me. '' Poirot! '' I cried. <div class="bookquote">``This is a fragment of a will!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) sharply. <div class="bookquote">``You are not surprised?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said gravely, <div class="bookquote">``I expected it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I relinquished the piece of paper, and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) put it away in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) case, with the same methodical care that he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) bestowed on everything. My brain was in a whirl. What was this complication of a will? Who had destroyed it? The person who had left the candle grease on the floor? Obviously. But how had anyone gained admission? All the doors had been bolted on the inside. '' Now, my friend,'' said Poirot briskly, <div class="bookquote">``we will go. I should like to ask a few questions of the parlourmaid--Dorcas , her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) name is, is it not?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>We passed through Alfred Inglethorp's room, and Poirot delayed long enough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it. We went out through that door, locking both it and that of Mrs. Inglethorp's room as before. I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) down to the boudoir which he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) had expressed a wish to see, and went myself in search of Dorcas. When I returned with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>), however, the boudoir was empty. '' Poirot,'' I cried, <div class="bookquote">``where are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am here, my friend.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had stepped outside the French window, and was standing, apparently lost in admiration, before the various shaped flower beds. '' Admirable!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) murmured. '' Admirable! What symmetry! Observe that crescent; and those diamonds--their neatness rejoices the eye. The spacing of the plants, also, is perfect. It has been recently done; is it not so?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon. But come in-- Dorcas is here.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Eh bien, eh bien! Do not grudge me a moment's satisfaction of the eye.'' '' Yes, but this affair is more important.'' <div class="bookquote">``And how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal importance? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shrugged my shoulders. There was really no arguing with him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) chose to take that line. <div class="bookquote">``You do not agree? But such things have been. Well, we will come in and interview the brave Dorcas.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorcas/Mademoiselle Dorcas</b></font>)</div>Dorcas was standing in the boudoir, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) hands folded in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) grey hair rose in stiff waves under her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) white cap. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) was the very model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) attitude towards Poirot, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) was inclined to be suspicious, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) soon broke down her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) defences. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) drew forward a chair. <div class="bookquote">``Pray be seated, mademoiselle.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been with your mistress many years, is it not so?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ten years, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is a long time, and very faithful service. You were much attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), were you not?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was a very good mistress to me, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then you will not object to answering a few questions. I put them to you with Mr. Cavendish's full approval.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, certainly, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then I will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday afternoon. Your mistress had a quarrel?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. But I don't know that I ought--''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorcas/Mademoiselle Dorcas</b></font>)</div>Dorcas hesitated. Poirot looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) keenly. <div class="bookquote">``My good Dorcas, it is necessary that I should know every detail of that quarrel as fully as possible. Do not think that you are betraying your mistress's secrets. Your mistress lies dead, and it is necessary that we should know all--if we are to avenge her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). Nothing can bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) back to life, but we do hope, if there has been foul play, to bring the murderer to justice.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Amen to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorcas/Mademoiselle Dorcas</b></font>)</div>said Dorcas fiercely. '' And, naming no names, there's one in this house that none of us could ever abide! And an ill day it was when first he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) darkened the threshold. '' Poirot waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) indignation to subside, and then, resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) business-like tone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) asked: '' Now, as to this quarrel? What is the first you heard of it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, I happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What time was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't say exactly, sir, but it wasn't tea-time by a long way. Perhaps four o'clock-- or it may have been a bit later. Well, sir, as I said, I happened to be passing along, when I heard voices very loud and angry in here.
<p/>I didn't exactly mean to listen, but--well, there it is. I stopped. The door was shut, but the mistress was speaking very sharp and clear, and I heard what she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) said quite plainly. ' You have lied to me, and deceived me,' she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) said. I didn't hear what Mr. Inglethorp replied. He (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) spoke a good bit lower than she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) did--but she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) answered: `How dare you? I have kept you and clothed you and fed you! You owe everything to me! And this is how you repay me! By bringing disgrace upon our name!' Again I didn't hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) said, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) went on: `Nothing that you can say will make any difference. I see my duty clearly. My mind is made up. You need not think that any fear of publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.' Then I thought I heard them coming out, so I went off quickly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are sure it was Mr. Inglethorp's voice you heard?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, sir, whose else's could it be?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, what happened next?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Later, I came back to the hall; but it was all quiet. At five o'clock, Mrs. Inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) a cup of tea--nothing to eat--to the boudoir. She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) was looking dreadful--so white and upset. ' Dorcas,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) says, `I've had a great shock.' `I'm sorry for that, m'm,' I says. `You'll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea, m'm.' She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) had something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) hand. I don't know if it was a letter, or just a piece of paper, but it had writing on it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) kept staring at it, almost as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) couldn't believe what was written there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) whispered to herself, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) had forgotten I was there: '
<p/>These few words--and everything's changed.' And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) says to me: `Never trust a man, Dorcas, they're not worth it!' I hurried off, and got her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) a good strong cup of tea, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) thanked me, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>)'d feel better when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>)'d drunk it. ' I don't know what to do,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) says. ' Scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing, Dorcas. I'd rather hush it up if I could.' Mrs. Cavendish came in just then, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) didn't say any more.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) still had the letter, or whatever it was, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) hand?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What would she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) be likely to do with it afterwards?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't know, sir, I expect she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) would lock it up in that purple case of hers.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is that where she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) usually kept important papers?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) brought it down with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) every morning, and took it up every night.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``When did she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) lose the key of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) missed it yesterday at lunch-time, sir, and told me to look carefully for it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) was very much put out about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) had a duplicate key?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorcas/Mademoiselle Dorcas</b></font>)</div>Dorcas was looking very curiously at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) and, to tell the truth, so was I. What was all this about a lost key? Poirot smiled. '' Never mind, Dorcas, it is my business to know things. Is this the key that was lost?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) drew from his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) pocket the key that he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) had found in the lock of the despatch-case upstairs. Dorcas's eyes looked as though they would pop out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``That's it, sir, right enough. But where did you find it? I looked everywhere for it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Ah, but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was to-day.
<p/>Now, to pass to another subject, had your mistress a dark green dress in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) wardrobe?'' Dorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question. '' No, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Are you quite sure?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Has anyone else in the house got a green dress?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorcas/Mademoiselle Dorcas</b></font>)</div>Dorcas reflected. '' Miss Cynthia has a green evening dress.'' <div class="bookquote">``Light or dark green?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A light green, sir; a sort of chiffon, they call it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that is not what I want. And nobody else has anything green?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, sir--not that I know of. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot's face did not betray a trace of whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was disappointed or otherwise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) merely remarked: <div class="bookquote">``Good, we will leave that and pass on. Have you any reason to believe that your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not last night, sir, I know she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) didn't.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why do you know so positively?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because the box was empty. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) took the last one two days ago, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) didn't have any more made up.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are quite sure of that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Positive, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then that is cleared up! By the way, your mistress didn't ask you to sign any paper yesterday?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To sign a paper? No, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``When Mr. Hastings and Mr. Lawrence came in yesterday evening, they found your mistress busy writing letters. I suppose you can give me no idea to whom these letters were addressed?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I couldn't, sir. I was out in the evening. Perhaps Annie could tell you, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)'s a careless girl. Never cleared the coffee-cups away last night. That's what happens when I'm not here to look after things.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) hand. '' Since they have been left, Dorcas, leave them a little longer, I pray you. I should like to examine them.'' '' Very well, sir.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What time did you go out last evening?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``About six o'clock, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Dorcas, that is all I have to ask you.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) rose and strolled to the window. <div class="bookquote">``I have been admiring these flower beds. How many gardeners are employed here, by the way?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Only three now, sir. Five, we had, before the war, when it was kept as a gentleman's place should be. I wish you could have seen it then, sir. A fair sight it was. But now there's only old Manning, and young William, and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such-like. Ah, these are dreadful times!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The good times will come again, Dorcas. At least, we hope so. Now, will you send Annie to me here?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How did you know that Mrs. Inglethorp took sleeping powders? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, in lively curiosity, as Dorcas left the room. '' And about the lost key and the duplicate?'' <div class="bookquote">``One thing at a time. As to the sleeping powders, I knew by this.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) suddenly produced a small cardboard box, such as chemists use for powders. <div class="bookquote">``Where did you find it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Inglethorp/Inglethorp</b></font>)</div>'' In the wash-stand drawer in Mrs. Inglethorp's bedroom. It was Number Six of my catalogue.'' <div class="bookquote">``But I suppose, as the last powder was taken two days ago, it is not of much importance?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Probably not, but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar about this box? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I examined it closely. '' No, I can't say that I do.'' <div class="bookquote">``Look at the label. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I read the label carefully: ''`One powder to be taken at bedtime, if required. Mrs. Inglethorp.' No, I see nothing unusual.'' <div class="bookquote">``Not the fact that there is no chemist's name?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``To be sure, that is odd!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that, without his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) printed name?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I can't say that I have. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was becoming quite excited, but Poirot damped my ardour by remarking: <div class="bookquote">``Yet the explanation is quite simple. So do not intrigue yourself, my friend.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>An audible creaking proclaimed the approach of Annie, so I had no time to reply. Annie was a fine, strapping girl, and was evidently labouring under intense excitement, mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the tragedy. Poirot came to the point at once, with a business-like briskness. <div class="bookquote">``I sent for you, Annie, because I thought you might be able to tell me something about the letters Mrs. Inglethorp wrote last night. How many were there? And can you tell me any of the names and addresses?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>Annie considered. <div class="bookquote">``There were four letters, sir. One was to Miss Howard, and one was to Mr. Wells, the lawyer, and the other two I don't think I remember, sir -- oh, yes, one was to Ross's, the caterers in Tadminster. The other one, I don't remember.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>urged Poirot. Annie racked her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) brains in vain. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry, sir, but it's clean gone. I don't think I can have noticed it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It does not matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot, not betraying any sign of disappointment. <div class="bookquote">``Now I want to ask you about something else. There is a saucepan in Mrs. Inglethorp's room with some cocoa in it. Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) have that every night?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, it was put in her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) room every evening, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) warmed it up in the night--whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) fancied it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What was it? Plain cocoa?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, made with milk, with a teaspoonful of sugar, and two teaspoonfuls of rum in it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who took it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) room?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I did, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Always?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``At what time?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``When I went to draw the curtains, as a rule, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did you bring it straight up from the kitchen then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, you see there's not much room on the gas stove, so Cook used to make it early, before putting the vegetables on for supper. Then I used to bring it up, and put it on the table by the swing door, and take it into her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) room later.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The swing door is in the left wing, is it not?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And the table, is it on this side of the door, or on the farther--servants' side?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's this side, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What time did you bring it up last night?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``About quarter-past seven, I should say, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And when did you take it into Mrs. Inglethorp's room?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' When I went to shut up, sir. About eight o'clock. Mrs. Inglethorp came up to bed before I'd finished.'' <div class="bookquote">``Then, between 7.15 and 8 o'clock, the cocoa was standing on the table in the left wing?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>Annie had been growing redder and redder in the face, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) blurted out unexpectedly: '' And if there was salt in it, sir, it wasn't me. I never took the salt near it.'' <div class="bookquote">``What makes you think there was salt in it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>asked Poirot. '' Seeing it on the tray, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``You saw some salt on the tray?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Coarse kitchen salt, it looked. I never noticed it when I took the tray up, but when I came to take it into the mistress's room I saw it at once, and I suppose I ought to have taken it down again, and asked Cook to make some fresh.
<p/>But I was in a hurry, because Dorcas was out, and I thought maybe the cocoa itself was all right, and the salt had only gone on the tray. So I dusted it off with my apron, and took it in. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement. Unknown to herself, Annie had provided us with an important piece of evidence. How she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) would have gaped if she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) had realized that her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``coarse kitchen salt''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was strychnine, one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind. I marvelled at Poirot's calm. His (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) self-control was astonishing. I awaited his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) next question with impatience, but it disappointed me. <div class="bookquote">``When you went into Mrs. Inglethorp's room, was the door leading into Miss Cynthia's room bolted?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Yes, sir; it always was. It had never been opened.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And the door into Mr. Inglethorp's room? Did you notice if that was bolted too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>Annie hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't rightly say, sir; it was shut but I couldn't say whether it was bolted or not.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``When you finally left the room, did Mrs. Inglethorp bolt the door after you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, not then, but I expect she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) did later. She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) usually did lock it at night. The door into the passage, that is.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the room yesterday?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Candle grease? Oh, no, sir. Mrs. Inglethorp didn't have a candle, only a reading-lamp.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then, if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor, you think you would have been sure to have seen it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, and I would have taken it out with a piece of blotting-paper and a hot iron.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Then Poirot repeated the question he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) had put to Dorcas: <div class="bookquote">``Did your mistress ever have a green dress?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorcas/Mademoiselle Dorcas</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nor a mantle, nor a cape, nor a--how do you call it?--a sports coat?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not green, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nor anyone else in the house?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>Annie reflected. '' No, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``You are sure of that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Quite sure.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Bien! That is all I want to know. Thank you very much.'' With a nervous giggle, Annie took herself creakingly out of the room. My pent-up excitement burst forth. '' Poirot,'' I cried, <div class="bookquote">``I congratulate you! This is a great discovery.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What is a great discovery?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned. That explains everything! Of course it did not take effect until the early morning, since the cocoa was only drunk in the middle of the night.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So you think that the cocoa--mark well what I say, Hastings, the cocoa --contained strychnine? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course! That salt on the tray, what else could it have been?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It might have been salt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>replied Poirot placidly. I shrugged my shoulders. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was going to take the matter that way, it was no good arguing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>). The idea crossed my mind, not for the first time, that poor old Poirot was growing old. Privately I thought it lucky that he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) had associated with him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) someone of a more receptive type of mind. Poirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes. <div class="bookquote">``You are not pleased with me, mon ami? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My dear Poirot,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said coldly, <div class="bookquote">``it is not for me to dictate to you. You have a right to your own opinion, just as I have to mine.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A most admirable sentiment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>remarked Poirot, rising briskly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``Now I have finished with this room. By the way, whose is the smaller desk in the corner?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Inglethorp's.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) tried the roll top tentatively. '' Locked. But perhaps one of Mrs. Inglethorp's keys would open it.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) tried several, twisting and turning them with a practiced hand, and finally uttering an ejaculation of satisfaction. '' Voil ! It is not the key, but it will open it at a pinch.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) slid back the roll top, and ran a rapid eye over the neatly filed papers. To my surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) did not examine them, merely remarking approvingly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) relocked the desk: <div class="bookquote">``Decidedly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) is a man of method, this Mr. Inglethorp!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>A <div class="bookquote">``man of method''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>was, in Poirot's estimation, the highest praise that could be bestowed on any individual. I felt that my friend was not what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) rambled on disconnectedly: <div class="bookquote">``There were no stamps in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) desk, but there might have been, eh, mon ami? There might have been? Yes'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyes wandered round the room--<div class="bookquote">``this boudoir has nothing more to tell us. It did not yield much. Only this.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pulled a crumpled envelope out of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pocket, and tossed it over to me. It was rather a curious document. A plain, dirty looking old envelope with a few words scrawled across it, apparently at random. The following is a facsimile of it. CHAPTER V. <div class="bookquote">``IT ISN'T STRYCHNINE, IS IT?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where did you find this? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked Poirot, in lively curiosity. '' In the waste-paper basket. You recognise the handwriting?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is Mrs. Inglethorp's. But what does it mean? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot say--but it is suggestive. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>A wild idea flashed across me. Was it possible that Mrs. Inglethorp's mind was deranged? Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) some fantastic idea of demoniacal possession?
<p/>And, if that were so, was it not also possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) might have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) own life? I was about to expound these theories to Poirot, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) own words distracted me. '' Come,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``now to examine the coffee-cups!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' My dear Poirot! What on earth is the good of that, now that we know about the cocoa?'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, l l ! That miserable cocoa! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>cried Poirot flippantly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) laughed with apparent enjoyment, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) arms to heaven in mock despair, in what I could not but consider the worst possible taste. '' And, anyway,'' I said, with increasing coldness, <div class="bookquote">``as Mrs. Inglethorp took her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) coffee upstairs with her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>), I do not see what you expect to find, unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of strychnine on the coffee tray!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Poirot was sobered at once. '' Come, come, my friend,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said, slipping his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) arms through mine. '' Ne vous fâchez pas! Allow me to interest myself in my coffee-cups, and I will respect your cocoa. There! Is it a bargain?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was so quaintly humorous that I was forced to laugh; and we went together to the drawing-room, where the coffee-cups and tray remained undisturbed as we had left them. Poirot made me recapitulate the scene of the night before, listening very carefully, and verifying the position of the various cups. '' So Mrs. Cavendish stood by the tray--and poured out. Yes. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) came across to the window where you sat with Mademoiselle Cynthia. Yes. Here are the three cups. And the cup on the mantel-piece, half drunk, that would be Mr. Lawrence Cavendish's. And the one on the tray?'' <div class="bookquote">``John Cavendish's. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) put it down there.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good.
<p/>One, two, three, four, five--but where, then, is the cup of Mr. Inglethorp?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) does not take coffee.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then all are accounted for. One moment, my friend.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With infinite care, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) took a drop or two from the grounds in each cup, sealing them up in separate test tubes, tasting each in turn as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did so. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) physiognomy underwent a curious change. An expression gathered there that I can only describe as half puzzled, and half relieved. '' Bien! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``It is evident! I had an idea--but clearly I was mistaken. Yes, altogether I was mistaken. Yet it is strange. But no matter!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And, with a characteristic shrug, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) dismissed whatever it was that was worrying him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mind. I could have told him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) from the beginning that this obsession of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) over the coffee was bound to end in a blind alley, but I restrained my tongue. After all, though he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was old, Poirot had been a great man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) day. '' Breakfast is ready,'' said John Cavendish, coming in from the hall. <div class="bookquote">``You will breakfast with us, Monsieur Poirot?''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot acquiesced. I observed John. Already he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was almost restored to his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) normal self. The shock of the events of the last night had upset him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) temporarily, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) equable poise soon swung back to the normal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was a man of very little imagination, in sharp contrast with his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) brother, who had, perhaps, too much. Ever since the early hours of the morning, John had been hard at work, sending telegrams--one of the first had gone to Evelyn Howard--writing notices for the papers, and generally occupying himself with the melancholy duties that a death entails. '' May I ask how things are proceeding?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do your investigations point to my mother having died a natural death--or--or must we prepare ourselves for the worst?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think, Mr. Cavendish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot gravely, <div class="bookquote">``that you would do well not to buoy yourself up with any false hopes. Can you tell me the views of the other members of the family?''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My brother Lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) says that everything points to its being a simple case of heart failure.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) does, does he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>)? That is very interesting--very interesting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>murmured Poirot softly. '' And Mrs. Cavendish? '' A faint cloud passed over John's face. <div class="bookquote">``I have not the least idea what my wife's views on the subject are.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The answer brought a momentary stiffness in its train. John broke the rather awkward silence by saying with a slight effort: <div class="bookquote">``I told you, didn't I, that Mr. Inglethorp has returned?''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>Poirot bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``It's an awkward position for all of us. Of course one has to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) as usual--but, hang it all, one's gorge does rise at sitting down to eat with a possible murderer!''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot nodded sympathetically. <div class="bookquote">``I quite understand. It is a very difficult situation for you, Mr. Cavendish. I would like to ask you one question. Mr. Inglethorp's reason for not returning last night was, I believe, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) had forgotten the latch-key. Is not that so?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you are quite sure that the latch-key was forgotten--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) did not take it after all?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have no idea. I never thought of looking. We always keep it in the hall drawer. I'll go and see if it's there now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot held up his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) hand with a faint smile. '' No, no, Mr. Cavendish, it is too late now.
<p/>I am certain that you would find it. If Mr. Inglethorp did take it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) has had ample time to replace it by now.'' <div class="bookquote">``But do you think--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think nothing. If anyone had chanced to look this morning before his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) return, and seen it there, it would have been a valuable point in his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) favour. That is all.''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>John looked perplexed. '' Do not worry,'' said Poirot smoothly. <div class="bookquote">``I assure you that you need not let it trouble you. Since you are so kind, let us go and have some breakfast. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Every one was assembled in the dining-room. Under the circumstances, we were naturally not a cheerful party. The reaction after a shock is always trying, and I think we were all suffering from it. Decorum and good breeding naturally enjoined that our demeanour should be much as usual, yet I could not help wondering if this self-control were really a matter of great difficulty. There were no red eyes, no signs of secretly indulged grief. I felt that I was right in my opinion that Dorcas was the person most affected by the personal side of the tragedy. I pass over Alfred Inglethorp, who acted the bereaved widower in a manner that I felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) know that we suspected him (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>), I wondered. Surely he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) could not be unaware of the fact, conceal it as we would. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) feel some secret stirring of fear, or was he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) confident that his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) crime would go unpunished? Surely the suspicion in the atmosphere must warn him (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) was already a marked man. But did every one suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>)? What about Mrs. Cavendish? I watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) sat at the head of the table, graceful, composed, enigmatic.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) soft grey frock, with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) slender hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) looked very beautiful. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) chose, however, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) face could be sphinx-like in its inscrutability. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) was very silent, hardly opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) lips, and yet in some queer way I felt that the great strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) personality was dominating us all. And little Cynthia? Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) suspect? She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) looked very tired and ill, I thought. The heaviness and languor of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) manner were very marked. I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) were feeling ill, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) answered frankly: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I've got the most beastly headache.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Have another cup of coffee, mademoiselle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot solicitously. <div class="bookquote">``It will revive you. It is unparalleled for the mal de tête .''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) jumped up and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) cup. '' No sugar,'' said Cynthia, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) picked up the sugar-tongs. '' No sugar? You abandon it in the war-time, eh?'' <div class="bookquote">``No, I never take it in coffee.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Sacré! '' murmured Poirot to himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) brought back the replenished cup. Only I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>), and glancing up curiously at the little man I saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face was working with suppressed excitement, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes were as green as a cat's. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had heard or seen something that had affected him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strongly--but what was it? I do not usually label myself as dense, but I must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted my attention. In another moment, the door opened and Dorcas appeared. '' Mr. Wells to see you, sir,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) said to John. I remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom Mrs. Inglethorp had written the night before. John rose immediately. <div class="bookquote">``Show him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) into my study.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) turned to us. <div class="bookquote">``My mother's lawyer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) explained.
<p/>And in a lower voice: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is also Coroner--you understand. Perhaps you would like to come with me? ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>We acquiesced and followed him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) out of the room. John strode on ahead and I took the opportunity of whispering to Poirot: <div class="bookquote">``There will be an inquest then? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot nodded absently. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) seemed absorbed in thought; so much so that my curiosity was aroused. <div class="bookquote">``What is it? You are not attending to what I say.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is true, my friend. I am much worried.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because Mademoiselle Cynthia does not take sugar in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) coffee.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What? You cannot be serious?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I am most serious. Ah, there is something there that I do not understand. My instinct was right.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What instinct?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee-cups. Chut ! no more now! ''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>We followed John into his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) study, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) closed the door behind us. Mr. Wells was a pleasant man of middle-age, with keen eyes, and the typical lawyer's mouth. John introduced us both, and explained the reason of our presence. <div class="bookquote">``You will understand, Wells,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``that this is all strictly private. We are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for investigation of any kind.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Quite so, quite so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wells/Wells</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wells soothingly. <div class="bookquote">``I wish we could have spared you the pain and publicity of an inquest, but of course it's quite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor's certificate.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I suppose so.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Clever man, Bauerstein. Great authority on toxicology, I believe.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>said John with a certain stiffness in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) manner. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) added rather hesitatingly: <div class="bookquote">``Shall we have to appear as witnesses--all of us, I mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You, of course--and ah--er--Mr.--er--Inglethorp. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>A slight pause ensued before the lawyer went on in his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) soothing manner: <div class="bookquote">``Any other evidence will be simply confirmatory, a mere matter of form.''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I see. ''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>A faint expression of relief swept over John's face. It puzzled me, for I saw no occasion for it. <div class="bookquote">``If you know of nothing to the contrary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wells/Wells</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Wells, <div class="bookquote">``I had thought of Friday. That will give us plenty of time for the doctor's report. The post-mortem is to take place to-night, I believe?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wells/Wells</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then that arrangement will suit you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I need not tell you, my dear Cavendish, how distressed I am at this most tragic affair.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can you give us no help in solving it, monsieur?''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>interposed Poirot, speaking for the first time since we had entered the room. <div class="bookquote">``I?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we heard that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote to you last night. You should have received the letter this morning.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I did, but it contains no information. It is merely a note asking me to call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) this morning, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) wanted my advice on a matter of great importance.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) gave you no hint as to what that matter might be?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Unfortunately, no.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is a pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>said John. '' A great pity,'' agreed Poirot gravely. There was silence. Poirot remained lost in thought for a few minutes. Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) turned to the lawyer again. '' Mr. Wells, there is one thing I should like to ask you--that is, if it is not against professional etiquette. In the event of Mrs. Inglethorp's death, who would inherit her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) money?'' The lawyer hesitated a moment, and then replied: <div class="bookquote">``The knowledge will be public property very soon, so if Mr. Cavendish does not object--''  (<font color='red'><b>The lawyer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>The lawyer</b></font>)</div>interpolated John.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not see any reason why I should not answer your question. By her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) last will, dated August of last year, after various unimportant legacies to servants, etc., she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) entire fortune to her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) stepson, Mr. John Cavendish.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Was not that--pardon the question, Mr. Cavendish--rather unfair to her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) other stepson, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I do not think so. You see, under the terms of their father's will, while John inherited the property, Lawrence, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) stepmother's death, would come into a considerable sum of money. Mrs. Inglethorp left her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) money to her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) elder stepson, knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>stepson</b></font>) would have to keep up Styles. It was, to my mind, a very fair and equitable distribution.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot nodded thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``I see. But I am right in saying, am I not, that by your English law that will was automatically revoked when Mrs. Inglethorp remarried?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wells/Wells</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wells bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``As I was about to proceed, Monsieur Poirot, that document is now null and void.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hein</b></font>)</div>'' Hein! '' said Poirot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) reflected for a moment, and then asked: <div class="bookquote">``Was Mrs. Inglethorp herself aware of that fact?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do not know. She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) may have been.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) was,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>said John unexpectedly. <div class="bookquote">``We were discussing the matter of wills being revoked by marriage only yesterday.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah! One more question, Mr. Wells. You say `her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) last will.'

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``On an average, she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) made a new will at least once a year,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wells/Wells</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wells imperturbably. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) was given to changing her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) mind as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) testamentary dispositions, now benefiting one, now another member of her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) family.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>suggested Poirot, <div class="bookquote">``that, unknown to you, she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) had made a new will in favour of someone who was not, in any sense of the word, a member of the family--we will say Miss Howard , for instance--would you be surprised?''

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>John Cavendish had turned to Poirot. <div class="bookquote">``Will you come with us, Monsieur Poirot?

(<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the lawyer, <div class="bookquote">``it is quite possible that there may be a later will than the one in my possession.''

(<font color='red'><b>both men</b></font>)</div>broke simultaneously from both men.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, of course--but I don't see--''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) hand. '' Do as I ask you. Afterwards you shall question as much as you please.'' <div class="bookquote">``Very well.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) rang the bell. Dorcas answered it in due course. '' Dorcas, will you tell Manning to come round and speak to me here.'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorcas/Mademoiselle Dorcas</b></font>)</div>Dorcas withdrew. We waited in a tense silence. Poirot alone seemed perfectly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) ease, and dusted a forgotten corner of the bookcase. The clumping of hobnailed boots on the gravel outside proclaimed the approach of Manning. John looked questioningly at Poirot. The latter nodded. '' Come inside, Manning,'' said John, <div class="bookquote">``I want to speak to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>Manning came slowly and hesitatingly through the French window, and stood as near it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Manning</b></font>) could. He (<font color='blue'><b>Manning</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Manning</b></font>) cap in his (<font color='blue'><b>Manning</b></font>) hands, twisting it very carefully round and round. His (<font color='blue'><b>Manning</b></font>) back was much bent, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Manning</b></font>) was probably not as old as he (<font color='blue'><b>Manning</b></font>) looked, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Manning</b></font>) eyes were sharp and intelligent, and belied his (<font color='blue'><b>Manning</b></font>) slow and rather cautious speech. '' Manning,'' said John, <div class="bookquote">``this gentleman will put some questions to you which I want you to answer.''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Manning</b></font>)</div>mumbled Manning. Poirot stepped forward briskly. Manning's eye swept over him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) with a faint contempt. <div class="bookquote">``You were planting a bed of begonias round by the south side of the house yesterday afternoon, were you not, Manning?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, me and Willum.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And Mrs. Inglethorp came to the window and called you, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) not?''

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) slipped it into a long envelope, and put it inside a sort of purple box that was standing on the desk.''

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Manning, that will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot pleasantly. The gardener glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) master, who nodded, whereupon Manning lifted a finger to his (<font color='blue'><b>Manning</b></font>) forehead with a low mumble, and backed cautiously out of the window. We all looked at each other. '' Good heavens! '' murmured John. <div class="bookquote">``What an extraordinary coincidence.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How--a coincidence?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That my mother should have made a will on the very day of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) death!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wells/Wells</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wells cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) throat and remarked drily: <div class="bookquote">``Are you so sure it is a coincidence, Cavendish?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wells/Wells</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your mother, you tell me, had a violent quarrel with--someone yesterday afternoon--''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean? ''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>cried John again. There was a tremor in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) voice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had gone very pale. '' In consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and hurriedly makes a new will. The contents of that will we shall never know. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told no one of its provisions. This morning, no doubt, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have consulted me on the subject--but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had no chance. The will disappears, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) takes its secret with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grave. Cavendish, I much fear there is no coincidence there. Monsieur Poirot, I am sure you agree with me that the facts are very suggestive.'' <div class="bookquote">``Suggestive, or not,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>interrupted John, <div class="bookquote">``we are most grateful to Monsieur Poirot for elucidating the matter. But for him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>), we should never have known of this will. I suppose, I may not ask you, monsieur, what first led you to suspect the fact?''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>Poirot smiled and answered: <div class="bookquote">``A scribbled over old envelope, and a freshly planted bed of begonias.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>John, I think, would have pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) questions further, but at that moment the loud purr of a motor was audible, and we all turned to the window as it swept past. '' Evie! '' cried John. '' Excuse me, Wells.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) went hurriedly out into the hall. Poirot looked inquiringly at me. '' Miss Howard,'' I explained. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, I am glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) has come. There is a woman with a head and a heart too, Hastings. Though the good God gave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) no beauty!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I followed John's example, and went out into the hall, where Miss Howard was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass of veils that enveloped her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) head. As her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) eyes fell on me, a sudden pang of guilt shot through me. This was the woman who had warned me so earnestly, and to whose warning I had, alas, paid no heed! How soon, and how contemptuously, I had dismissed it from my mind. Now that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been proved justified in so tragic a manner, I felt ashamed. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had known Alfred Inglethorp only too well. I wondered whether, if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had remained at Styles, the tragedy would have taken place, or would the man have feared her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) watchful eyes? I was relieved when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shook me by the hand, with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) well remembered painful grip. The eyes that met mine were sad, but not reproachful; that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been crying bitterly, I could tell by the redness of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyelids, but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) manner was unchanged from its old gruffness. '' Started the moment I got the wire. Just come off night duty. Hired car. Quickest way to get here. '' <div class="bookquote">``Have you had anything to eat this morning, Evie? ''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>asked John. '' No.'' <div class="bookquote">``I thought not. Come along, breakfast's not cleared away yet, and they'll make you some fresh tea.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) turned to me. '' Look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>), Hastings, will you? Wells is waiting for me. Oh, here's Monsieur Poirot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>)'s helping us, you know, Evie.'' Miss Howard shook hands with Poirot, but glanced suspiciously over her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) shoulder at John. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean--helping us?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Helping us to investigate.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing to investigate.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who? Alfred Inglethorp, of course!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My dear Evie, do be careful.
<p/>Lawrence is of the opinion that my mother died from heart seizure.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``More fool, Lawrence!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Howard</b></font>)</div>retorted Miss Howard. <div class="bookquote">``Of course Alfred Inglethorp murdered poor Emily--as I always told you he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) would.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My dear Evie, don't shout so. Whatever we may think or suspect, it is better to say as little as possible for the present. The inquest isn't until Friday.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not until fiddlesticks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Howard</b></font>)</div>The snort Miss Howard gave was truly magnificent. <div class="bookquote">``You're all off your heads. The man will be out of the country by then. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s any sense, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't stay here tamely and wait to be hanged.''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>John Cavendish looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) helplessly. <div class="bookquote">``I know what it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) accused him (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you've been listening to the doctors.

Anyone with any sense could see at once that her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) husband had poisoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>). I always said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'d murder her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) bed, poor soul. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s done it. And all you can do is to murmur silly things about `heart seizure' and `inquest on Friday.' You ought to be ashamed of yourself, John Cavendish.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What do you want me to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>asked John, unable to help a faint smile. <div class="bookquote">``Dash it all, Evie, I can't haul him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) down to the local police station by the scruff of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) neck.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, you might do something. Find out how he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did it. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'s a crafty beggar. Dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) soaked fly papers. Ask Cook if she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>)'s missed any.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>It occurred to me very forcibly at that moment that to harbour Miss Howard and Alfred Inglethorp under the same roof, and keep the peace between them, was likely to prove a Herculean task, and I did not envy John. I could see by the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) face that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) fully appreciated the difficulty of the position. For the moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sought refuge in retreat, and left the room precipitately. Dorcas brought in fresh tea. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) left the room, Poirot came over from the window where he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) had been standing, and sat down facing Miss Howard. <div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said gravely, <div class="bookquote">``I want to ask you something.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ask away,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady, eyeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) with some disfavour. <div class="bookquote">``I want to be able to count upon your help.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll help you to hang Alfred with pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) replied gruffly. <div class="bookquote">``Hanging's too good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>).

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We are at one then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot, <div class="bookquote">``for I, too, want to hang the criminal.''

But it was only her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) purse they were after. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) life was safe enough.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Believe me, Miss Howard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot very earnestly, <div class="bookquote">``if Mr. Inglethorp is the man, he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) shall not escape me.

Now your help may be very valuable to me. I will tell you why. Because, in all this house of mourning, yours are the only eyes that have wept.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Howard</b></font>)</div>Miss Howard blinked, and a new note crept into the gruffness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``If you mean that I was fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>)--yes, I was. You know, Emily was a selfish old woman in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) was very generous, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) always wanted a return. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) never let people forget what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) had done for them--and, that way she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) missed love. Don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) ever realized it, though, or felt the lack of it. Hope not, anyway. I was on a different footing. I took my stand from the first. ' So many pounds a year I'm worth to you. Well and good. But not a penny piece besides--not a pair of gloves, nor a theatre ticket.' She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) didn't understand--was very offended sometimes. Said I was foolishly proud. It wasn't that--but I couldn't explain. Anyway, I kept my self-respect. And so, out of the whole bunch, I was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>). I watched over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>). I guarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) from the lot of them, and then a glib-tongued scoundrel comes along, and pooh! all my years of devotion go for nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot nodded sympathetically. <div class="bookquote">``I understand, mademoiselle, I understand all you feel. It is most natural. You think that we are lukewarm--that we lack fire and energy--but trust me, it is not so.''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>John stuck his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) head in at this juncture, and invited us both to come up to Mrs. Inglethorp's room, as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) and Mr. Wells had finished looking through the desk in the boudoir. As we went up the stairs, John looked back to the dining-room door, and lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) voice confidentially: <div class="bookquote">``Look here, what's going to happen when these two meet? ''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>I shook my head helplessly. <div class="bookquote">``I've told Mary to keep them apart if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) be able to do so?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Lord only knows.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You've got the keys still, haven't you, Poirot? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, as we reached the door of the locked room. Taking the keys from Poirot, John unlocked it, and we all passed in. The lawyer went straight to the desk, and John followed him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``My mother kept most of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) important papers in this despatch-case, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But it's not locked now.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Impossible!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``See.''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>And John lifted the lid as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) spoke. '' Milles tonnerres! '' cried Poirot, dumfounded. '' And I--who have both the keys in my pocket!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) flung himself upon the case. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) stiffened. '' Eh voil une affaire! This lock has been forced.'' <div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot laid down the case again. '' But who forced it? Why should they? When? But the door was locked?'' These exclamations burst from us disjointedly. Poirot answered them categorically--almost mechanically. '' Who? That is the question. Why? Ah, if I only knew. When? Since I was here an hour ago. As to the door being locked, it is a very ordinary lock. Probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it. '' We stared at one another blankly. Poirot had walked over to the mantel-piece. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was outwardly calm, but I noticed his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) hands, which from long force of habit were mechanically straightening the spill vases on the mantel-piece, were shaking violently. '' See here, it was like this,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said at last.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was something in that case--some piece of evidence, slight in itself perhaps, but still enough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime. It was vital to him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) that it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its significance appreciated. Therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) took the risk, the great risk, of coming in here. Finding the case locked, he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) was obliged to force it, thus betraying his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) presence. For him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) to take that risk, it must have been something of great importance.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But what was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>cried Poirot, with a gesture of anger. <div class="bookquote">``That, I do not know!

And I--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) anger burst forth freely--<div class="bookquote">``miserable animal that I am! I guessed nothing! I have behaved like an imbecile! I should never have left that case here. I should have carried it away with me. Ah, triple pig! And now it is gone. It is destroyed--but is it destroyed? Is there not yet a chance--we must leave no stone unturned--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) rushed like a madman from the room, and I followed him (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) as soon as I had sufficiently recovered my wits. But, by the time I had reached the top of the stairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) was out of sight. Mary Cavendish was standing where the staircase branched, staring down into the hall in the direction in which he (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) had disappeared. <div class="bookquote">``What has happened to your extraordinary little friend, Mr. Hastings?

<p/>As I saw a faint smile gather on Mrs. Cavendish's expressive mouth, I endeavoured to try and turn the conversation by saying: <div class="bookquote">``They haven't met yet, have they?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Inglethorp and Miss Howard.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, don't you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, rather taken aback. '' No. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) was smiling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) quiet way. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to see a good flare up. It would clear the air. At present we are all thinking so much, and saying so little.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``John doesn't think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'s anxious to keep them apart.'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, John! ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) tone fired me, and I blurted out: <div class="bookquote">``Old John's an awfully good sort. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) studied me curiously for a minute or two, and then said, to my great surprise: <div class="bookquote">``You are loyal to your friend. I like you for that.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you my friend too?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am a very bad friend.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why do you say that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because it is true. I am charming to my friends one day, and forget all about them the next. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I don't know what impelled me, but I was nettled, and I said foolishly and not in the best of taste: <div class="bookquote">``Yet you seem to be invariably charming to Dr. Bauerstein!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Instantly I regretted my words. Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) face stiffened. I had the impression of a steel curtain coming down and blotting out the real woman. Without a word, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned and went swiftly up the stairs, whilst I stood like an idiot gaping after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below. I could hear Poirot shouting and expounding.
<p/>I was vexed to think that my diplomacy had been in vain. The little man appeared to be taking the whole house into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) confidence, a proceeding of which I, for one, doubted the wisdom. Once again I could not help regretting that my friend was so prone to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) head in moments of excitement. I stepped briskly down the stairs. The sight of me calmed Poirot almost immediately. I drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) aside. <div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``is this wise? Surely you don't want the whole house to know of this occurrence? You are actually playing into the criminal's hands.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You think so, Hastings?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am sure of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, my friend, I will be guided by you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good. Although, unfortunately, it is a little too late now.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) looked so crestfallen and abashed that I felt quite sorry, though I still thought my rebuke a just and wise one. '' Well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``let us go, mon ami .''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You have finished here?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``For the moment, yes. You will walk back with me to the village?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Willingly.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) little suit-case, and we went out through the open window in the drawing-room. Cynthia Murdoch was just coming in, and Poirot stood aside to let her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pass. '' Excuse me, mademoiselle, one minute.'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) turned inquiringly. <div class="bookquote">``Did you ever make up Mrs. Inglethorp's medicines? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>A slight flush rose in her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) face, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) answered rather constrainedly: <div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Only her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) powders? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>The flush deepened as Cynthia replied: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I did make up some sleeping powders for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) once.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``These?''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot produced the empty box which had contained powders. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) nodded. '' Can you tell me what they were? Sulphonal? Veronal?'' <div class="bookquote">``No, they were bromide powders.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>Thank you, mademoiselle; good morning.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>As we walked briskly away from the house, I glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) more than once. I had often before noticed that, if anything excited him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) eyes turned green like a cat's. They were shining like emeralds now. '' My friend,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) broke out at last, <div class="bookquote">``I have a little idea, a very strange, and probably utterly impossible idea. And yet--it fits in. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I shrugged my shoulders. I privately thought that Poirot was rather too much given to these fantastic ideas. In this case, surely, the truth was only too plain and apparent. '' So that is the explanation of the blank label on the box,'' I remarked. '' Very simple, as you said. I really wonder that I did not think of it myself. '' Poirot did not appear to be listening to me. <div class="bookquote">``They have made one more discovery, la-bas,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) observed, jerking his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) thumb over his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) shoulder in the direction of Styles. '' Mr. Wells told me as we were going upstairs.'' <div class="bookquote">``What was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Locked up in the desk in the boudoir, they found a will of Mrs. Inglethorp's, dated before her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) marriage, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) fortune to Alfred Inglethorp. It must have been made just at the time they were engaged. It came quite as a surprise to Wells--and to John Cavendish also. It was written on one of those printed will forms, and witnessed by two of the servants--not Dorcas.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did Mr. Inglethorp know of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) says not.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``One might take that with a grain of salt,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked sceptically. <div class="bookquote">``All these wills are very confusing. Tell me, how did those scribbled words on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made yesterday afternoon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot smiled. ''
<p/>Mon ami , have you ever, when writing a letter, been arrested by the fact that you did not know how to spell a certain word?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, often. I suppose every one has.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Exactly. And have you not, in such a case, tried the word once or twice on the edge of the blotting-paper, or a spare scrap of paper, to see if it looked right? Well, that is what Mrs. Inglethorp did. You will notice that the word `possessed' is spelt first with one 's' and subsequently with two--correctly. To make sure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) had further tried it in a sentence, thus: 'I am possessed.' Now, what did that tell me? It told me that Mrs. Inglethorp had been writing the word `possessed' that afternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh in my mind, the possibility of a will---LRB-a document almost certain to contain that word-RRB---occurred to me at once. This possibility was confirmed by a further circumstance. In the general confusion, the boudoir had not been swept that morning, and near the desk were several traces of brown mould and earth. The weather had been perfectly fine for some days, and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy deposit. <div class="bookquote">``I strolled to the window, and saw at once that the begonia beds had been newly planted. The mould in the beds was exactly similar to that on the floor of the boudoir, and also I learnt from you that they had been planted yesterday afternoon.
<p/>I was now sure that one, or possibly both of the gardeners--for there were two sets of footprints in the bed--had entered the boudoir, for if Mrs. Inglethorp had merely wished to speak to them she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) would in all probability have stood at the window, and they would not have come into the room at all. I was now quite convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) had made a fresh will, and had called the two gardeners in to witness her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) signature. Events proved that I was right in my supposition.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That was very ingenious,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could not help admitting. <div class="bookquote">``I must confess that the conclusions I drew from those few scribbled words were quite erroneous.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) smiled. '' You gave too much rein to your imagination. Imagination is a good servant, and a bad master. The simplest explanation is always the most likely.'' '' Another point--how did you know that the key of the despatch-case had been lost?'' <div class="bookquote">``I did not know it. It was a guess that turned out to be correct. You observed that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle. That suggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy key-ring. Now, if it had been lost and recovered, Mrs. Inglethorp would at once have replaced it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) bunch; but on her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) bunch I found what was obviously the duplicate key, very new and bright, which led me to the hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the lock of the despatch-case.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``Alfred Inglethorp, without doubt.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Poirot looked at me curiously. <div class="bookquote">``You are very sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) guilt?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, naturally. Every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more clearly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot quietly, <div class="bookquote">``there are several points in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) favour.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come now!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I see only one.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was not in the house last night.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>''`Bad shot!' as you English say! You have chosen the one point that to my mind tells against him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``How is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because if Mr. Inglethorp knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) wife would be poisoned last night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) would certainly have arranged to be away from the house. His (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) excuse was an obviously trumped up one. That leaves us two possibilities: either he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) knew what was going to happen or he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) had a reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) own for his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) absence.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And that reason? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked sceptically. Poirot shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``How should I know? Discreditable, without doubt. This Mr. Inglethorp, I should say, is somewhat of a scoundrel--but that does not of necessity make him (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) a murderer. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shook my head, unconvinced. <div class="bookquote">``We do not agree, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot. '' Well, let us leave it. Time will show which of us is right. Now let us turn to other aspects of the case. What do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom were bolted on the inside?'' <div class="bookquote">``Well--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I considered. <div class="bookquote">``One must look at it logically.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``True.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I should put it this way. The doors were bolted-- our own eyes have told us that--yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor, and the destruction of the will, prove that during the night someone entered the room. You agree so far?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Perfectly. Put with admirable clearness. Proceed.'' <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, encouraged, <div class="bookquote">``as the person who entered did not do so by the window, nor by miraculous means, it follows that the door must have been opened from inside by Mrs. Inglethorp herself. That strengthens the conviction that the person in question was her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) husband.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) would naturally open the door to her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) own husband.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Poirot shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) head. '' Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) had bolted the door leading into his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) room--a most unusual proceeding on her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) part--she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) had had a most violent quarrel with him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) that very afternoon. No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was the last person she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) would admit.'' <div class="bookquote">``But you agree with me that the door must have been opened by Mrs. Inglethorp herself?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There is another possibility. She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) may have forgotten to bolt the door into the passage when she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) went to bed, and have got up later, towards morning, and bolted it then.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Poirot, is that seriously your opinion?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I do not say it is so, but it might be. Now, to turn to another feature, what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overheard between Mrs. Cavendish and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) mother-in-law?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I had forgotten that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``That is as enigmatical as ever. It seems incredible that a woman like Mrs. Cavendish, proud and reticent to the last degree, should interfere so violently in what was certainly not her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) affair.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Precisely. It was an astonishing thing for a woman of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breeding to do.'' <div class="bookquote">``It is certainly curious,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I agreed. '' Still, it is unimportant, and need not be taken into account. '' A groan burst from Poirot. <div class="bookquote">``What have I always told you? Everything must be taken into account. If the fact will not fit the theory--let the theory go.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, we shall see,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, nettled. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, we shall see. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>We had reached Leastways Cottage, and Poirot ushered me upstairs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) own room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) offered me one of the tiny Russian cigarettes he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) himself occasionally smoked.
<p/>I was amused to notice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) stowed away the used matches most carefully in a little china pot. My momentary annoyance vanished. Poirot had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which commanded a view of the village street. The fresh air blew in warm and pleasant. It was going to be a hot day. Suddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing down the street at a great pace. It was the expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face that was extraordinary--a curious mingling of terror and agitation. '' Look, Poirot!'' I said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) leant forward. '' Tiens! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It is Mr. Mace, from the chemist's shop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mace</b></font>) is coming here. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The young man came to a halt before Leastways Cottage, and, after hesitating a moment, pounded vigorously at the door. '' A little minute,'' cried Poirot from the window. <div class="bookquote">``I come. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Motioning to me to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) ran swiftly down the stairs and opened the door. Mr. Mace began at once. '' Oh, Mr. Poirot, I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I heard that you'd just come back from the Hall?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, we have. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The young man moistened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dry lips. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face was working curiously. <div class="bookquote">``It's all over the village about old Mrs. Inglethorp dying so suddenly. They do say--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice cautiously--<div class="bookquote">``that it's poison? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Poirot's face remained quite impassive. '' Only the doctors can tell us that, Mr. Mace.'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, exactly--of course-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The young man hesitated, and then his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) agitation was too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clutched Poirot by the arm, and sank his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) voice to a whisper: <div class="bookquote">``Just tell me this, Mr. Poirot, it isn't-- it isn't strychnine, is it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>I hardly heard what Poirot replied.
<p/>Something evidently of a non-committal nature. The young man departed, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) closed the door Poirot's eyes met mine. '' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said, nodding gravely. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) will have evidence to give at the inquest. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We went slowly upstairs again. I was opening my lips, when Poirot stopped me with a gesture of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) hand. '' Not now, not now, mon ami . I have need of reflection. My mind is in some disorder--which is not well.'' For about ten minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) sat in dead silence, perfectly still, except for several expressive motions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) eyebrows, and all the time his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) eyes grew steadily greener. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) heaved a deep sigh. <div class="bookquote">``It is well. The bad moment has passed. Now all is arranged and classified. One must never permit confusion. The case is not clear yet--no. For it is of the most complicated! It puzzles me . Me , Hercule Poirot! There are two facts of significance.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And what are they?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The first is the state of the weather yesterday. That is very important.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But it was a glorious day! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interrupted. <div class="bookquote">``Poirot, you're pulling my leg!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. The thermometer registered 80 degrees in the shade. Do not forget that, my friend. It is the key to the whole riddle!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And the second point? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. '' The important fact that Monsieur Inglethorp wears very peculiar clothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses.'' <div class="bookquote">``Poirot, I cannot believe you are serious.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am absolutely serious, my friend.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But this is childish!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, it is very momentous.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And supposing the Coroner's jury returns a verdict of Wilful Murder against Alfred Inglethorp. What becomes of your theories, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to make a mistake!
<p/>But that will not occur. For one thing, a country jury is not anxious to take responsibility upon itself, and Mr. Inglethorp stands practically in the position of local squire. Also,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) added placidly, '' I should not allow it!'' '' You would not allow it?'' <div class="bookquote">``No. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked at the extraordinary little man, divided between annoyance and amusement. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so tremendously sure of himself. As though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read my thoughts, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nodded gently. '' Oh, yes, mon ami , I would do what I say. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got up and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand on my shoulder. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) physiognomy underwent a complete change. Tears came into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``In all this, you see, I think of that poor Mrs. Inglethorp who is dead. She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) was not extravagantly loved--no. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) was very good to us Belgians--I owe her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) a debt. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I endeavoured to interrupt, but Poirot swept on. '' Let me tell you this, Hastings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) would never forgive me if I let Alfred Inglethorp, her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) husband, be arrested now --when a word from me could save him (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>)!'' CHAPTER VI. THE INQUEST In the interval before the inquest, Poirot was unfailing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) activity. Twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was closeted with Mr. Wells. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) also took long walks into the country. I rather resented his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) not taking me into his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) confidence, the more so as I could not in the least guess what he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was driving at. It occurred to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) might have been making inquiries at Raikes's farm; so, finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) out when I called at Leastways Cottage on Wednesday evening, I walked over there by the fields, hoping to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>). But there was no sign of him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>), and I hesitated to go right up to the farm itself.
<p/>As I walked away, I met an aged rustic, who leered at me cunningly. '' You'm from the Hall, bain't you? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) asked. '' Yes. I'm looking for a friend of mine whom I thought might have walked this way.'' <div class="bookquote">``A little chap? As waves his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) hands when he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) talks? One of them Belgies from the village?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said eagerly. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) has been here, then?'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, ay, he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s been here, right enough. More'n once too. Friend of yours, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Friend</b></font>)? Ah, you gentlemen from the Hall-- you'n a pretty lot!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Friend</b></font>) leered more jocosely than ever. <div class="bookquote">``Why, do the gentlemen from the Hall come here often? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, as carelessly as I could. He (<font color='blue'><b>Friend</b></font>) winked at me knowingly. '' One does, mister. Naming no names, mind. And a very liberal gentleman too! Oh, thank you, sir, I'm sure. '' I walked on sharply. Evelyn Howard had been right then, and I experienced a sharp twinge of disgust, as I thought of Alfred Inglethorp's liberality with another woman's money. Had that piquant gipsy face been at the bottom of the crime, or was it the baser mainspring of money? Probably a judicious mixture of both. On one point, Poirot seemed to have a curious obsession. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) once or twice observed to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) thought Dorcas must have made an error in fixing the time of the quarrel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) suggested to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) repeatedly that it was 4.30, and not 4 o'clock when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) had heard the voices. But Dorcas was unshaken. Quite an hour, or even more, had elapsed between the time when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) had heard the voices and 5 o'clock, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) had taken tea to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) mistress. The inquest was held on Friday at the Stylites Arms in the village.
<p/>Poirot and I sat together, not being required to give evidence. The preliminaries were gone through. The jury viewed the body, and John Cavendish gave evidence of identification. Further questioned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) described his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) awakening in the early hours of the morning, and the circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) mother's death. The medical evidence was next taken. There was a breathless hush, and every eye was fixed on the famous London specialist, who was known to be one of the greatest authorities of the day on the subject of toxicology. In a few brief words, he (<font color='blue'><b>specialist</b></font>) summed up the result of the post-mortem. Shorn of its medical phraseology and technicalities, it amounted to the fact that Mrs. Inglethorp had met her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) death as the result of strychnine poisoning. Judging from the quantity recovered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) must have taken not less than three-quarters of a grain of strychnine, but probably one grain or slightly over. '' Is it possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) could have swallowed the poison by accident? '' asked the Coroner. <div class="bookquote">``I should consider it very unlikely. Strychnine is not used for domestic purposes, as some poisons are, and there are restrictions placed on its sale.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Does anything in your examination lead you to determine how the poison was administered?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You arrived at Styles before Dr. Wilkins, I believe?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is so. The motor met me just outside the lodge gates, and I hurried there as fast as I could.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Will you relate to us exactly what happened next?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I entered Mrs. Inglethorp's room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) was at that moment in a typical tetanic convulsion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) turned towards me, and gasped out: `Alfred--Alfred--'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Could the strychnine have been administered in Mrs. Inglethorp's after-dinner coffee which was taken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) husband?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Possibly, but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action.
<p/>The symptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed. It is retarded under certain conditions, none of which, however, appear to have been present in this case. I presume Mrs. Inglethorp took the coffee after dinner about eight o'clock, whereas the symptoms did not manifest themselves until the early hours of the morning, which, on the face of it, points to the drug having been taken much later in the evening.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Inglethorp was in the habit of drinking a cup of cocoa in the middle of the night. Could the strychnine have been administered in that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I myself took a sample of the cocoa remaining in the saucepan and had it analysed. There was no strychnine present. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I heard Poirot chuckle softly beside me. <div class="bookquote">``How did you know? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered. <div class="bookquote">``Listen.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I should say'' (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>--the doctor was continuing--<div class="bookquote">``that I would have been considerably surprised at any other result.''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Simply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste. It can be detected in a solution of 1 in 70,000, and can only be disguised by some strongly flavoured substance. Cocoa would be quite powerless to mask it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>One of the jury wanted to know if the same objection applied to coffee. '' No. Coffee has a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover the taste of strychnine.'' <div class="bookquote">``Then you consider it more likely that the drug was administered in the coffee, but that for some unknown reason its action was delayed.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, but, the cup being completely smashed, there is no possibility of analyzing its contents. '' This concluded Dr. Bauerstein's evidence. Dr. Wilkins corroborated it on all points. Sounded as to the possibility of suicide, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilkins</b></font>) repudiated it utterly.
<p/>The deceased, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilkins</b></font>) said, suffered from a weak heart, but otherwise enjoyed perfect health, and was of a cheerful and well-balanced disposition. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bauerstein</b></font>) would be one of the last people to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Bauerstein</b></font>) own life. Lawrence Cavendish was next called. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) evidence was quite unimportant, being a mere repetition of that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) brother. Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) was about to step down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) paused, and said rather hesitatingly: <div class="bookquote">``I should like to make a suggestion if I may?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) glanced deprecatingly at the Coroner, who replied briskly: <div class="bookquote">``Certainly, Mr. Cavendish, we are here to arrive at the truth of this matter, and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Coroner</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is just an idea of mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lawrence/Monsieur Lawrence</b></font>)</div>explained Lawrence. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I may be quite wrong, but it still seems to me that my mother's death might be accounted for by natural means.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How do you make that out, Mr. Cavendish?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My mother, at the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) death, and for some time before it, was taking a tonic containing strychnine.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Coroner</b></font>)</div>said the Coroner. The jury looked up, interested. <div class="bookquote">``I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lawrence/Monsieur Lawrence</b></font>)</div>continued Lawrence, <div class="bookquote">``that there have been cases where the cumulative effect of a drug, administered for some time, has ended by causing death. Also, is it not possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) may have taken an overdose of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) medicine by accident?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lawrence/Monsieur Lawrence</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) death. We are much obliged to you, Mr. Cavendish.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Wilkins/Wilkins</b></font>)</div>Dr. Wilkins was recalled and ridiculed the idea. <div class="bookquote">``What Mr. Cavendish suggests is quite impossible. Any doctor would tell you the same. Strychnine is, in a certain sense, a cumulative poison, but it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in this way.
<p/>There would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms which would at once have attracted my attention. The whole thing is absurd.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And the second suggestion? That Mrs. Inglethorp may have inadvertently taken an overdose?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Three, or even four doses, would not have resulted in death. Mrs. Inglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a time, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) dealt with Coot's, the Cash Chemists in Tadminster. She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) would have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the amount of strychnine found at the post-mortem.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any way instrumental in causing her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) death?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. The supposition is ridiculous. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The juryman</b></font>)</div>The same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the chemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error. <div class="bookquote">``That, of course, is always possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor. But Dorcas, who was the next witness called, dispelled even that possibility. The medicine had not been newly made up. On the contrary, Mrs. Inglethorp had taken the last dose on the day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) death. So the question of the tonic was finally abandoned, and the Coroner proceeded with his (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) task. Having elicited from Dorcas how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) had been awakened by the violent ringing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) mistress's bell, and had subsequently roused the household, he (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) passed to the subject of the quarrel on the preceding afternoon. Dorcas's evidence on this point was substantially what Poirot and I had already heard, so I will not repeat it here. The next witness was Mary Cavendish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) stood very upright, and spoke in a low, clear, and perfectly composed voice.
<p/>In answer to the Coroner's question, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) told how, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) alarm clock having aroused her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) at 4.30 as usual, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) was dressing, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) was startled by the sound of something heavy falling. <div class="bookquote">``That would have been the table by the bed?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Coroner</b></font>)</div>commented the Coroner. <div class="bookquote">``I opened my door,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Cavendish</b></font>)</div>continued Mary, <div class="bookquote">``and listened. In a few minutes a bell rang violently. Dorcas came running down and woke my husband, and we all went to my mother-in-law's room, but it was locked--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Cavendish</b></font>)</div>The Coroner interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I really do not think we need trouble you further on that point. We know all that can be known of the subsequent happenings. But I should be obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the day before.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a faint insolence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) hand and adjusted the ruffle of lace at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) neck, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) head a little as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) did so. And quite spontaneously the thought flashed across my mind: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) is gaining time!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Coroner</b></font>)</div>continued the Coroner deliberately, <div class="bookquote">``that you were sitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the boudoir. That is so, is it not? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Coroner</b></font>)</div>This was news to me and glancing sideways at Poirot, I fancied that it was news to him (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) as well. There was the faintest pause, the mere hesitation of a moment, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) answered: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, that is so.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And the boudoir window was open, was it not?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Surely her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) face grew a little paler as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) answered: <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside, especially as they were raised in anger. In fact, they would be more audible where you were than in the hall.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Possibly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Will you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I really do not remember hearing anything.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to say you did not hear voices?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I heard the voices, but I did not hear what they said. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A faint spot of colour came into her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) cheek. <div class="bookquote">``I am not in the habit of listening to private conversations.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Coroner</b></font>)</div>The Coroner persisted. '' And you remember nothing at all? Nothing , Mrs. Cavendish? Not one stray word or phrase to make you realize that it was a private conversation? '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) paused, and seemed to reflect, still outwardly as calm as ever. '' Yes; I remember. Mrs. Inglethorp said something--I do not remember exactly what--about causing scandal between husband and wife.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Coroner</b></font>)</div>the Coroner leant back satisfied. '' That corresponds with what Dorcas heard. But excuse me, Mrs. Cavendish, although you realized it was a private conversation, you did not move away? You remained where you were? '' I caught the momentary gleam of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) tawny eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) raised them. I felt certain that at that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) would willingly have torn the little lawyer, with his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) insinuations, into pieces, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) replied quietly enough: '' No. I was very comfortable where I was. I fixed my mind on my book.'' <div class="bookquote">``And that is all you can tell us?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is all. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The examination was over, though I doubted if the Coroner was entirely satisfied with it. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) suspected that Mary Cavendish could tell more if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) chose. Amy Hill, shop assistant, was next called, and deposed to having sold a will form on the afternoon of the 17th to William Earl, under-gardener at Styles. William Earl and Manning succeeded her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>), and testified to witnessing a document.
<p/>Manning fixed the time at about 4.30, William was of the opinion that it was rather earlier. Cynthia Murdoch came next. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) had, however, little to tell. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) had known nothing of the tragedy, until awakened by Mrs. Cavendish. <div class="bookquote">``You did not hear the table fall?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. I was fast asleep. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The Coroner</b></font>)</div>The Coroner smiled. '' A good conscience makes a sound sleeper,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) observed. '' Thank you, Miss Murdoch, that is all.'' <div class="bookquote">``Miss Howard. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Howard</b></font>)</div>Miss Howard produced the letter written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) by Mrs. Inglethorp on the evening of the 17th. Poirot and I had, of course already seen it. It added nothing to our knowledge of the tragedy. The following is a facsimile: STYLES COURT ESSEX hand written note: July 17th My dear Evelyn Can we not bury the hachet? I have found it hard to forgive the things you said against my dear husband but I am an old woman and very fond of you Yours affectionately, Emily Inglethorpe It was handed to the jury who scrutinized it attentively. <div class="bookquote">``I fear it does not help us much,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Coroner</b></font>)</div>said the Coroner, with a sigh. <div class="bookquote">``There is no mention of any of the events of that afternoon.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Plain as a pikestaff to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Howard</b></font>)</div>said Miss Howard shortly. <div class="bookquote">``It shows clearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>)'d been made a fool of!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It says nothing of the kind in the letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Coroner</b></font>)</div>the Coroner pointed out. '' No, because Emily never could bear to put herself in the wrong. But I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) wanted me back. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) wasn't going to own that I'd been right. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) went round about. Most people do. Don't believe in it myself.'' Mr. Wells smiled faintly. So, I noticed, did several of the jury.
<p/>Miss Howard was obviously quite a public character. <div class="bookquote">``Anyway, all this tomfoolery is a great waste of time,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>continued the lady, glancing up and down the jury disparagingly. '' Talk--talk--talk! When all the time we know perfectly well-- '' The Coroner interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in an agony of apprehension: <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Miss Howard, that is all. ''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>I fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) breathed a sigh of relief when she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) complied. Then came the sensation of the day. The Coroner called Albert Mace, chemist's assistant. It was our agitated young man of the pale face. In answer to the Coroner's questions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) explained that he (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) was a qualified pharmacist, but had only recently come to this particular shop, as the assistant formerly there had just been called up for the army. These preliminaries completed, the Coroner proceeded to business. '' Mr. Mace, have you lately sold strychnine to any unauthorized person?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``When was this?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Last Monday night.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Monday? Not Tuesday?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, Monday, the 16th.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Will you tell us to whom you sold it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>You could have heard a pin drop. '' Yes, sir. It was to Mr. Inglethorp. '' Every eye turned simultaneously to where Alfred Inglethorp was sitting, impassive and wooden. He (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) started slightly, as the damning words fell from the young man's lips. I half thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) was going to rise from his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) chair, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) remained seated, although a remarkably well acted expression of astonishment rose on his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``You are sure of what you say?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Coroner</b></font>)</div>asked the Coroner sternly. '' Quite sure, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Are you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the counter?''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The wretched young man wilted visibly under the Coroner's frown. '' Oh, no, sir--of course not.
<p/>But, seeing it was Mr. Inglethorp of the Hall, I thought there was no harm in it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) said it was to poison a dog.'' Inwardly I sympathized. It was only human nature to endeavour to please '' The Hall''--especially when it might result in custom being transferred from Coot's to the local establishment. <div class="bookquote">``Is it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, Mr. Inglethorp did so.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Have you got the book here?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was produced; and, with a few words of stern censure, the Coroner dismissed the wretched Mr. Mace. Then, amidst a breathless silence, Alfred Inglethorp was called. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) realize, I wondered, how closely the halter was being drawn around his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) neck? The Coroner went straight to the point. '' On Monday evening last, did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of poisoning a dog?'' Inglethorp replied with perfect calmness: <div class="bookquote">``No, I did not. There is no dog at Styles, except an outdoor sheepdog, which is in perfect health.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Inglethorp/Inglethorp</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You deny absolutely having purchased strychnine from Albert Mace on Monday last?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you also deny this ?''  (<font color='red'><b>The Coroner</b></font>)</div>The Coroner handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) the register in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) signature was inscribed. '' Certainly I do. The hand-writing is quite different from mine. I will show you.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) took an old envelope out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) pocket, and wrote his (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) name on it, handing it to the jury. It was certainly utterly dissimilar. '' Then what is your explanation of Mr. Mace's statement?'' Alfred Inglethorp replied imperturbably: <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Mace must have been mistaken.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Inglethorp/Alfred Inglethorp/Alfred</b></font>)</div>The Coroner hesitated for a moment, and then said: <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Inglethorp, as a mere matter of form, would you mind telling us where you were on the evening of Monday, July 16th?''  (<font color='red'><b>The Coroner</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Really--I can't remember.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is absurd, Mr. Inglethorp,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Coroner</b></font>)</div>said the Coroner sharply. <div class="bookquote">``Think again. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Inglethorp/Inglethorp</b></font>)</div>Inglethorp shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell you. I have an idea that I was out walking.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``In what direction?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I really can't remember.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Coroner</b></font>)</div>The Coroner's face grew graver. <div class="bookquote">``Were you in company with anyone?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did you meet anyone on your walk?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is a pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Coroner</b></font>)</div>said the Coroner dryly. <div class="bookquote">``I am to take it then that you decline to say where you were at the time that Mr. Mace positively recognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If you like to take it that way, yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Be careful, Mr. Inglethorp. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot was fidgeting nervously. '' Sacre! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``Does this imbecile of a man want to be arrested? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Inglethorp/Inglethorp</b></font>)</div>Inglethorp was indeed creating a bad impression. His (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) futile denials would not have convinced a child. The Coroner, however, passed briskly to the next point, and Poirot drew a deep breath of relief. <div class="bookquote">``You had a discussion with your wife on Tuesday afternoon?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Inglethorp/Alfred Inglethorp/Alfred</b></font>)</div>interrupted Alfred Inglethorp, <div class="bookquote">``you have been misinformed.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You have my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Inglethorp/Inglethorp</b></font>)</div>said Inglethorp haughtily. The Coroner did not trouble to reply. <div class="bookquote">``There are two witnesses who will swear to having heard your disagreement with Mrs. Inglethorp.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Those witnesses were mistaken. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was puzzled. The man spoke with such quiet assurance that I was staggered. I looked at Poirot. There was an expression of exultation on his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) face which I could not understand. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) at last convinced of Alfred Inglethorp's guilt? ''
<p/>Mr. Inglethorp,'' said the Coroner, <div class="bookquote">``you have heard your wife's dying words repeated here. Can you explain them in any way?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Coroner</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I can.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You can?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me very simple. The room was dimly lighted. Dr. Bauerstein is much of my height and build, and, like me, wears a beard. In the dim light, and suffering as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was, my poor wife mistook him (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) for me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>murmured Poirot to himself. '' But it is an idea, that!'' <div class="bookquote">``You think it is true? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered. <div class="bookquote">``I do not say that. But it is truly an ingenious supposition.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You read my wife's last words as an accusation'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Inglethorp/Inglethorp</b></font>)</div>--Inglethorp was continuing--<div class="bookquote">``they were, on the contrary, an appeal to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Inglethorp/Inglethorp</b></font>)</div>The Coroner reflected a moment, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I believe, Mr. Inglethorp, that you yourself poured out the coffee, and took it to your wife that evening?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I poured it out, yes. But I did not take it to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). I meant to do so, but I was told that a friend was at the hall door, so I laid down the coffee on the hall table. When I came through the hall again a few minutes later, it was gone. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>This statement might, or might not, be true, but it did not seem to me to improve matters much for Inglethorp. In any case, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had had ample time to introduce the poison. At that point, Poirot nudged me gently, indicating two men who were sitting together near the door. One was a little, sharp, dark, ferret-faced man, the other was tall and fair. I questioned Poirot mutely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) lips to my ear. '' Do you know who that little man is? '' I shook my head. ''
<p/>That is Detective Inspector James Japp of Scotland Yard--Jimmy Japp. The other man is from Scotland Yard too. Things are moving quickly, my friend. '' I stared at the two men intently. There was certainly nothing of the policeman about them. I should never have suspected them of being official personages. I was still staring, when I was startled and recalled by the verdict being given: <div class="bookquote">``Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER VII. POIROT PAYS HIS (<font color='blue'><b>POIROT</b></font>) DEBTS As we came out of the Stylites Arms, Poirot drew me aside by a gentle pressure of the arm. I understood his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) object. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was waiting for the Scotland Yard men. In a few moments, they emerged, and Poirot at once stepped forward, and accosted the shorter of the two. <div class="bookquote">``I fear you do not remember me, Inspector Japp.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, if it isn't Mr. Poirot!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Inspector</b></font>)</div>cried the Inspector. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) turned to the other man. <div class="bookquote">``You've heard me speak of Mr. Poirot? It was in 1904 he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) and I worked together--the Abercrombie forgery case--you remember, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was run down in Brussels. Ah, those were great days, moosier. Then, do you remember `Baron' Altara? There was a pretty rogue for you! He (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) eluded the clutches of half the police in Europe. But we nailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) in Antwerp--thanks to Mr. Poirot here.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>As these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in, I drew nearer, and was introduced to Detective-Inspector Japp, who, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) turn, introduced us both to his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) companion, Superintendent Summerhaye. <div class="bookquote">``I need hardly ask what you are doing here, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>remarked Poirot. Japp closed one eye knowingly. '' No, indeed. Pretty clear case I should say. '' But Poirot answered gravely: <div class="bookquote">``There I differ from you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Summerhaye</b></font>)</div>said Summerhaye, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) lips for the first time. ''
<p/>Surely the whole thing is clear as daylight. The man's caught red-handed. How he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could be such a fool beats me!'' But Japp was looking attentively at Poirot. '' Hold your fire, Summerhaye,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) remarked jocularly. <div class="bookquote">``Me and Moosier here have met before--and there's no man's judgment I'd sooner take than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). If I'm not greatly mistaken, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s got something up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleeve. Isn't that so, moosier?''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I have drawn certain conclusions--yes. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Summerhaye</b></font>)</div>Summerhaye was still looking rather sceptical, but Japp continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) scrutiny of Poirot. <div class="bookquote">``It's this way,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``so far, we've only seen the case from the outside. That's where the Yard's at a disadvantage in a case of this kind, where the murder's only out, so to speak, after the inquest. A lot depends on being on the spot first thing, and that's where Mr. Poirot's had the start of us. We shouldn't have been here as soon as this even, if it hadn't been for the fact that there was a smart doctor on the spot, who gave us the tip through the Coroner. But you've been on the spot from the first, and you may have picked up some little hints. From the evidence at the inquest, Mr. Inglethorp murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) wife as sure as I stand here, and if anyone but you hinted the contrary I'd laugh in his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) face. I must say I was surprised the jury didn't bring it in Wilful Murder against him (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) right off. I think they would have, if it hadn't been for the Coroner--he (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) seemed to be holding them back.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, though, you have a warrant for his (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) arrest in your pocket now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>suggested Poirot. A kind of wooden shutter of officialdom came down from Japp's expressive countenance. ''
<p/>Perhaps I have, and perhaps I haven't,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) remarked dryly. Poirot looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``I am very anxious, Messieurs, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) should not be arrested.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dare say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Summerhaye</b></font>)</div>observed Summerhaye sarcastically. Japp was regarding Poirot with comical perplexity. <div class="bookquote">``Can't you go a little further, Mr. Poirot? A wink's as good as a nod--from you. You've been on the spot--and the Yard doesn't want to make any mistakes, you know. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot nodded gravely. <div class="bookquote">``That is exactly what I thought. Well, I will tell you this. Use your warrant: Arrest Mr. Inglethorp. But it will bring you no kudos--the case against him (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) will be dismissed at once! Comme ça! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) snapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) fingers expressively. Japp's face grew grave, though Summerhaye gave an incredulous snort. As for me, I was literally dumb with astonishment. I could only conclude that Poirot was mad. Japp had taken out a handkerchief, and was gently dabbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) brow. <div class="bookquote">``I daren't do it, Mr. Poirot. I'd take your word, but there's others over me who'll be asking what the devil I mean by it. Can't you give me a little more to go on?''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot reflected a moment. <div class="bookquote">``It can be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``I admit I do not wish it. It forces my hand. I would have preferred to work in the dark just for the present, but what you say is very just--the word of a Belgian policeman, whose day is past, is not enough! And Alfred Inglethorp must not be arrested. That I have sworn, as my friend Hastings here knows. See, then, my good Japp, you go at once to Styles?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, in about half an hour. We're seeing the Coroner and the doctor first.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good. Call for me in passing--the last house in the village.
<p/>I will go with you. At Styles, Mr. Inglethorp will give you, or if he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) refuses--as is probable--I will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the case against him (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) could not possibly be sustained. Is that a bargain?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's a bargain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Japp</b></font>)</div>said Japp heartily. '' And, on behalf of the Yard, I'm much obliged to you, though I'm bound to confess I can't at present see the faintest possible loop-hole in the evidence, but you always were a marvel! So long, then, moosier. '' The two detectives strode away, Summerhaye with an incredulous grin on his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Well, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>cried Poirot, before I could get in a word, <div class="bookquote">``what do you think? Mon Dieu! I had some warm moments in that court; I did not figure to myself that the man would be so pig-headed as to refuse to say anything at all. Decidedly, it was the policy of an imbecile.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``H'm! There are other explanations besides that of imbecility,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked. '' For, if the case against him (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) is true, how could he (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) defend himself except by silence?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, in a thousand ingenious ways,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>cried Poirot. '' See; say that it is I who have committed this murder, I can think of seven most plausible stories! Far more convincing than Mr. Inglethorp's stony denials! '' I could not help laughing. '' My dear Poirot, I am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy! But, seriously, in spite of what I heard you say to the detectives, you surely cannot still believe in the possibility of Alfred Inglethorp's innocence?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why not now as much as before? Nothing has changed.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But the evidence is so conclusive.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, too conclusive.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We turned in at the gate of Leastways Cottage, and proceeded up the now familiar stairs. '' Yes, yes, too conclusive,'' continued Poirot, almost to himself. '' Real evidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory. It has to be examined--sifted. But here the whole thing is cut and dried. No, my friend, this evidence has been very cleverly manufactured--so cleverly that it has defeated its own ends.'' <div class="bookquote">``How do you make that out?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because, so long as the evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was vague and intangible, it was very hard to disprove. But, in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) anxiety, the criminal has drawn the net so closely that one cut will set Inglethorp free. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was silent. And in a minute or two, Poirot continued: <div class="bookquote">``Let us look at the matter like this. Here is a man, let us say, who sets out to poison his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has lived by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wits as the saying goes. Presumably, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has some wits. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not altogether a fool. Well, how does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) set about it? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes boldly to the village chemist's and purchases strychnine under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own name, with a trumped up story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not employ the poison that night. No, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waits until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has had a violent quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), of which the whole household is cognisant, and which naturally directs their suspicions upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prepares no defence--no shadow of an alibi, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows the chemist's assistant must necessarily come forward with the facts. Bah! Do not ask me to believe that any man could be so idiotic! Only a lunatic, who wished to commit suicide by causing himself to be hanged, would act so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Still--I do not see-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I began. <div class="bookquote">``Neither do I see.
<p/>I tell you, mon ami , it puzzles me. Me --Hercule Poirot!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But if you believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) innocent, how do you explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) buying the strychnine?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very simply. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) did not buy it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But Mace recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Mace</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mace</b></font>) saw a man with a black beard like Mr. Inglethorp's, and wearing glasses like Mr. Inglethorp, and dressed in Mr. Inglethorp's rather noticeable clothes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) could not recognize a man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) had probably only seen in the distance, since, you remember, he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) himself had only been in the village a fortnight, and Mrs. Inglethorp dealt principally with Coot's in Tadminster.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then you think--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mon</b></font>)</div>'' Mon ami , do you remember the two points I laid stress upon? Leave the first one for the moment, what was the second?'' <div class="bookquote">``The important fact that Alfred Inglethorp wears peculiar clothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I quoted. '' Exactly. Now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as John or Lawrence Cavendish. Would it be easy?'' <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``Of course an actor--''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>But Poirot cut me short ruthlessly. '' And why would it not be easy? I will tell you, my friend: Because they are both clean-shaven men. To make up successfully as one of these two in broad daylight, it would need an actor of genius, and a certain initial facial resemblance. But in the case of Alfred Inglethorp, all that is changed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) clothes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) beard, the glasses which hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) eyes--those are the salient points about his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) personal appearance. Now, what is the first instinct of the criminal? To divert suspicion from himself, is it not so? And how can he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) best do that? By throwing it on someone else. In this instance, there was a man ready to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Everybody was predisposed to believe in Mr. Inglethorp's guilt. It was a foregone conclusion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) would be suspected; but, to make it a sure thing there must be tangible proof--such as the actual buying of the poison, and that, with a man of the peculiar appearance of Mr. Inglethorp, was not difficult. Remember, this young Mace had never actually spoken to Mr. Inglethorp. How should he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) doubt that the man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clothes, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beard and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glasses, was not Alfred Inglethorp?'' <div class="bookquote">``It may be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, fascinated by Poirot's eloquence. '' But, if that was the case, why does he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) not say where he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was at six o'clock on Monday evening?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, why indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot, calming down. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) were arrested, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) probably would speak, but I do not want it to come to that. I must make him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) see the gravity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) position. There is, of course, something discreditable behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) silence. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) did not murder his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) is, nevertheless, a scoundrel, and has something of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) own to conceal, quite apart from the murder.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What can it be? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I mused, won over to Poirot's views for the moment, although still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction was the correct one. <div class="bookquote">``Can you not guess?''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>asked Poirot, smiling. '' No, can you?'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I had a little idea sometime ago--and it has turned out to be correct.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You never told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said reproachfully. Poirot spread out his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) hands apologetically. '' Pardon me, mon ami , you were not precisely sympathique .'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) turned to me earnestly. '' Tell me--you see now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) must not be arrested?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said doubtfully, for I was really quite indifferent to the fate of Alfred Inglethorp, and thought that a good fright would do him (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) no harm. Poirot, who was watching me intently, gave a sigh. '' Come, my friend,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said, changing the subject, <div class="bookquote">``apart from Mr. Inglethorp, how did the evidence at the inquest strike you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, pretty much what I expected.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did nothing strike you as peculiar about it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Cavendish</b></font>)</div>My thoughts flew to Mary Cavendish, and I hedged: <div class="bookquote">``In what way?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish's evidence for instance? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was relieved. '' Oh, Lawrence! No, I don't think so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>)'s always a nervous chap.'' <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) suggestion that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) mother might have been poisoned accidentally by means of the tonic she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was taking, that did not strike you as strange-- hein? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I can't say it did. The doctors ridiculed it of course. But it was quite a natural suggestion for a layman to make.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But Monsieur Lawrence is not a layman. You told me yourself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) had started by studying medicine, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) degree.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's true. I never thought of that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was rather startled. <div class="bookquote">``It is odd.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot nodded. '' From the first, his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) behaviour has been peculiar. Of all the household, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) alone would be likely to recognize the symptoms of strychnine poisoning, and yet we find him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) the only member of the family to uphold strenuously the theory of death from natural causes. If it had been Monsieur John, I could have understood it. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) has no technical knowledge, and is by nature unimaginative. But Monsieur Lawrence--no! And now, to-day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) puts forward a suggestion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) himself must have known was ridiculous. There is food for thought in this, mon ami! ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very confusing,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I agreed. <div class="bookquote">``Then there is Mrs. Cavendish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>continued Poirot. <div class="bookquote">``That's another who is not telling all she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) knows! What do you make of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) attitude?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what to make of it. It seems inconceivable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) should be shielding Alfred Inglethorp. Yet that is what it looks like.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot nodded reflectively. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is queer. One thing is certain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) overheard a good deal more of that `private conversation' than she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) was willing to admit.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) is the last person one would accuse of stooping to eavesdrop!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Exactly. One thing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) evidence has shown me. I made a mistake. Dorcas was quite right. The quarrel did take place earlier in the afternoon, about four o'clock, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) said. '' I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) curiously. I had never understood his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) insistence on that point. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, a good deal that was peculiar came out to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>continued Poirot. '' Dr. Bauerstein, now, what was he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) doing up and dressed at that hour in the morning? It is astonishing to me that no one commented on the fact.'' <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) has insomnia, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said doubtfully. '' Which is a very good, or a very bad explanation,'' remarked Poirot. <div class="bookquote">``It covers everything, and explains nothing. I shall keep my eye on our clever Dr. Bauerstein.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Any more faults to find with the evidence? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired satirically. '' Mon ami ,'' replied Poirot gravely, <div class="bookquote">``when you find that people are not telling you the truth--look out! Now, unless I am much mistaken, at the inquest to-day only one--at most, two persons were speaking the truth without reservation or subterfuge.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come now, Poirot! I won't cite Lawrence, or Mrs. Cavendish. But there's John--and Miss Howard, surely they were speaking the truth?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Both of them, my friend?
<p/>One, I grant you, but both--!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) words gave me an unpleasant shock. Miss Howard's evidence, unimportant as it was, had been given in such a downright straightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) sincerity. Still, I had a great respect for Poirot's sagacity--except on the occasions when he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was what I described to myself as <div class="bookquote">``foolishly pig-headed.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you really think so? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. '' Miss Howard had always seemed to me so essentially honest--almost uncomfortably so.'' Poirot gave me a curious look, which I could not quite fathom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) seemed to speak, and then checked himself. '' Miss Murdoch too,'' I continued, <div class="bookquote">``there's nothing untruthful about her (<font color='blue'><b>Murdoch</b></font>) .''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. But it was strange that she (<font color='blue'><b>Murdoch</b></font>) never heard a sound, sleeping next door; whereas Mrs. Cavendish, in the other wing of the building, distinctly heard the table fall.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>)'s young. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) sleeps soundly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes, indeed! She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) must be a famous sleeper, that one! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I did not quite like the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Murdoch</b></font>) voice, but at that moment a smart knock reached our ears, and looking out of the window we perceived the two detectives waiting for us below. Poirot seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) hat, gave a ferocious twist to his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) moustache, and, carefully brushing an imaginary speck of dust from his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) sleeve, motioned me to precede him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) down the stairs; there we joined the detectives and set out for Styles. I think the appearance of the two Scotland Yard men was rather a shock--especially to John, though of course after the verdict, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had realized that it was only a matter of time. Still, the presence of the detectives brought the truth home to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) more than anything else could have done.
<p/>Poirot had conferred with Japp in a low tone on the way up, and it was the latter functionary who requested that the household, with the exception of the servants, should be assembled together in the drawing-room. I realized the significance of this. It was up to Poirot to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) boast good. Personally, I was not sanguine. Poirot might have excellent reasons for his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) belief in Inglethorp's innocence, but a man of the type of Summerhaye would require tangible proofs, and these I doubted if Poirot could supply. Before very long we had all trooped into the drawing-room, the door of which Japp closed. Poirot politely set chairs for every one. The Scotland Yard men were the cynosure of all eyes. I think that for the first time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream, but a tangible reality. We had read of such things--now we ourselves were actors in the drama. To-morrow the daily papers, all over England, would blazon out the news in staring headlines: <div class="bookquote">``MYSTERIOUS TRAGEDY IN ESSEX''  (<font color='red'><b>photographer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``WEALTHY LADY POISONED ''  (<font color='red'><b>photographer</b></font>)</div>There would be pictures of Styles, snap-shots of <div class="bookquote">``The family leaving the Inquest'' (<font color='red'><b>photographer</b></font>)</div>--the village photographer had not been idle! All the things that one had read a hundred times--things that happen to other people, not to oneself. And now, in this house, a murder had been committed. In front of us were <div class="bookquote">``the detectives in charge of the case. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>The well-known glib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before Poirot opened the proceedings. I think every one was a little surprised that it should be he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) and not one of the official detectives who took the initiative. ''
<p/>Mesdames and messieurs ,'' said Poirot, bowing as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) were a celebrity about to deliver a lecture, <div class="bookquote">``I have asked you to come here all together, for a certain object. That object, it concerns Mr. Alfred Inglethorp. ''  (<font color='red'><b>a celebrity</b></font>)</div>Inglethorp was sitting a little by himself--I think, unconsciously, every one had drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) chair slightly away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>)--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) gave a faint start as Poirot pronounced his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) name. '' Mr. Inglethorp,'' said Poirot, addressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) directly, <div class="bookquote">``a very dark shadow is resting on this house--the shadow of murder. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Inglethorp shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) head sadly. <div class="bookquote">``My poor wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) murmured. '' Poor Emily! It is terrible.'' <div class="bookquote">``I do not think, monsieur,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot pointedly, <div class="bookquote">``that you quite realize how terrible it may be--for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>And as Inglethorp did not appear to understand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Inglethorp, you are standing in very grave danger. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The two detectives fidgeted. I saw the official caution <div class="bookquote">``Anything you say will be used in evidence against you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>actually hovering on Summerhaye's lips. Poirot went on. '' Do you understand now, monsieur?'' <div class="bookquote">``No; What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot deliberately, <div class="bookquote">``that you are suspected of poisoning your wife. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>A little gasp ran round the circle at this plain speaking. <div class="bookquote">``Good heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Inglethorp/Inglethorp</b></font>)</div>cried Inglethorp, starting up. '' What a monstrous idea! I --poison my dearest Emily!'' <div class="bookquote">``I do not think'' (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>--Poirot watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) narrowly--<div class="bookquote">``that you quite realize the unfavourable nature of your evidence at the inquest. Mr. Inglethorp, knowing what I have now told you, do you still refuse to say where you were at six o'clock on Monday afternoon? ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>With a groan, Alfred Inglethorp sank down again and buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) hands. Poirot approached and stood over him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>). '' Speak!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) cried menacingly.
<p/>With an effort, Inglethorp raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) face from his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) hands. Then, slowly and deliberately, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``You will not speak?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. I do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me of what you say. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot nodded thoughtfully, like a man whose mind is made up. '' Soit! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Then I must speak for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Inglethorp/Alfred Inglethorp/Alfred</b></font>)</div>Alfred Inglethorp sprang up again. '' You? How can you speak? You do not know--'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) broke off abruptly. Poirot turned to face us. '' Mesdames and messieurs ! I speak! Listen! I, Hercule Poirot, affirm that the man who entered the chemist's shop, and purchased strychnine at six o'clock on Monday last was not Mr. Inglethorp, for at six o'clock on that day Mr. Inglethorp was escorting Mrs. Raikes back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Raikes</b></font>) home from a neighbouring farm. I can produce no less than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together, either at six or just after and, as you may know, the Abbey Farm, Mrs. Raikes's home, is at least two and a half miles distant from the village. There is absolutely no question as to the alibi!'' CHAPTER VIII. FRESH SUSPICIONS There was a moment's stupefied silence. Japp, who was the least surprised of any of us, was the first to speak. <div class="bookquote">``My word,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raikes</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``you're the goods! And no mistake, Mr. Poirot! These witnesses of yours are all right, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Voil ! I have prepared a list of them--names and addresses. You must see them, of course. But you will find it all right.'' <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure of that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Japp</b></font>)</div>Japp lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``I'm much obliged to you. A pretty mare's nest arresting him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) would have been.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) turned to Inglethorp. ''
<p/>But, if you'll excuse me, sir, why couldn't you say all this at the inquest?'' <div class="bookquote">``I will tell you why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>interrupted Poirot. <div class="bookquote">``There was a certain rumour--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Inglethorp/Alfred Inglethorp/Alfred</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A most malicious and utterly untrue one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Inglethorp/Alfred Inglethorp/Alfred</b></font>)</div>interrupted Alfred Inglethorp in an agitated voice. '' And Mr. Inglethorp was anxious to have no scandal revived just at present. Am I right?'' <div class="bookquote">``Quite right. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Inglethorp/Inglethorp</b></font>)</div>Inglethorp nodded. '' With my poor Emily not yet buried, can you wonder I was anxious that no more lying rumours should be started.'' <div class="bookquote">``Between you and me, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Japp</b></font>)</div>remarked Japp, <div class="bookquote">``I'd sooner have any amount of rumours than be arrested for murder. And I venture to think your poor lady would have felt the same. And, if it hadn't been for Mr. Poirot here, arrested you would have been, as sure as eggs is eggs!''  (<font color='red'><b>Japp</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was foolish, no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Inglethorp/Inglethorp</b></font>)</div>murmured Inglethorp. <div class="bookquote">``But you do not know, inspector, how I have been persecuted and maligned.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) shot a baleful glance at Evelyn Howard. <div class="bookquote">``Now, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Japp</b></font>)</div>said Japp, turning briskly to John, <div class="bookquote">``I should like to see the lady's bedroom, please, and after that I'll have a little chat with the servants. Don't you bother about anything. Mr. Poirot, here, will show me the way.''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>As they all went out of the room, Poirot turned and made me a sign to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) upstairs. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) caught me by the arm, and drew me aside. '' Quick, go to the other wing. Stand there--just this side of the baize door. Do not move till I come.'' Then, turning rapidly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) rejoined the two detectives. I followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) instructions, taking up my position by the baize door, and wondering what on earth lay behind the request. Why was I to stand in this particular spot on guard?
<p/>I looked thoughtfully down the corridor in front of me. An idea struck me. With the exception of Cynthia Murdoch's, every one's room was in this left wing. Had that anything to do with it? Was I to report who came or went? I stood faithfully at my post. The minutes passed. Nobody came. Nothing happened. It must have been quite twenty minutes before Poirot rejoined me. <div class="bookquote">``You have not stirred?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I've stuck here like a rock. Nothing's happened.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) pleased, or disappointed? <div class="bookquote">``You've seen nothing at all?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you have probably heard something? A big bump--eh, mon ami? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is it possible? Ah, but I am vexed with myself! I am not usually clumsy. I made but a slight gesture'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--I know Poirot's gestures--<div class="bookquote">``with the left hand, and over went the table by the bed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) looked so childishly vexed and crest-fallen that I hastened to console him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>). '' Never mind, old chap. What does it matter? Your triumph downstairs excited you. I can tell you, that was a surprise to us all. There must be more in this affair of Inglethorp's with Mrs. Raikes than we thought, to make him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) hold his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) tongue so persistently. What are you going to do now? Where are the Scotland Yard fellows?'' <div class="bookquote">``Gone down to interview the servants. I showed them all our exhibits. I am disappointed in Japp. He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) has no method!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hullo!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, looking out of the window. <div class="bookquote">``Here's Dr. Bauerstein. I believe you're right about that man, Poirot. I don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) is clever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>observed Poirot meditatively. '' Oh, clever as the devil! I must say I was overjoyed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) in the plight he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was in on Tuesday. You never saw such a spectacle!'' And I described the doctor's adventure. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) looked a regular scarecrow! Plastered with mud from head to foot.'' <div class="bookquote">``You saw him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) didn't want to come in--it was just after dinner--but Mr. Inglethorp insisted.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot caught me violently by the shoulders. '' Was Dr. Bauerstein here on Tuesday evening? Here? And you never told me? Why did you not tell me? Why? Why?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) appeared to be in an absolute frenzy. '' My dear Poirot,'' I expostulated, <div class="bookquote">``I never thought it would interest you. I didn't know it was of any importance.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Importance? It is of the first importance! So Dr. Bauerstein was here on Tuesday night--the night of the murder. Hastings, do you not see? That alters everything--everything! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Hastings</b></font>) so upset. Loosening his (<font color='blue'><b>Hastings</b></font>) hold of me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hastings</b></font>) mechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks, still murmuring to himself: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, that alters everything--everything.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Hastings</b></font>) seemed to come to a decision. '' Allons! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hastings</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We must act at once. Where is Mr. Cavendish? ''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>John was in the smoking-room. Poirot went straight to him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>). '' Mr. Cavendish, I have some important business in Tadminster. A new clue. May I take your motor?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, of course. Do you mean at once?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' If you please.'' John rang the bell, and ordered round the car. In another ten minutes, we were racing down the park and along the high road to Tadminster. '' Now, Poirot,'' I remarked resignedly, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps you will tell me what all this is about?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, mon ami , a good deal you can guess for yourself. Of course you realize that, now Mr. Inglethorp is out of it, the whole position is greatly changed. We are face to face with an entirely new problem.
<p/>We know now that there is one person who did not buy the poison. We have cleared away the manufactured clues. Now for the real ones. I have ascertained that anyone in the household, with the exception of Mrs. Cavendish, who was playing tennis with you, could have personated Mr. Inglethorp on Monday evening. In the same way, we have his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) statement that he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) put the coffee down in the hall. No one took much notice of that at the inquest--but now it has a very different significance. We must find out who did take that coffee to Mrs. Inglethorp eventually, or who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there. From your account, there are only two people whom we can positively say did not go near the coffee--Mrs. Cavendish, and Mademoiselle Cynthia.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that is so. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I felt an inexpressible lightening of the heart. Mary Cavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion. '' In clearing Alfred Inglethorp,'' continued Poirot, <div class="bookquote">``I have been obliged to show my hand sooner than I intended. As long as I might be thought to be pursuing him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>), the criminal would be off his (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) guard. Now, he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) will be doubly careful. Yes--doubly careful.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) turned to me abruptly. '' Tell me, Hastings, you yourself--have you no suspicions of anybody? '' I hesitated. To tell the truth, an idea, wild and extravagant in itself, had once or twice that morning flashed through my brain. I had rejected it as absurd, nevertheless it persisted. <div class="bookquote">``You couldn't call it a suspicion,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I murmured. <div class="bookquote">``It's so utterly foolish.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>urged Poirot encouragingly. '' Do not fear. Speak your mind. You should always pay attention to your instincts.'' <div class="bookquote">``Well then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I blurted out, <div class="bookquote">``it's absurd-- but I suspect Miss Howard of not telling all she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) knows!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Howard?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes--you'll laugh at me--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. Why should I?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't help feeling,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued blunderingly; <div class="bookquote">``that we've rather left her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) out of the possible suspects, simply on the strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) having been away from the place. But, after all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) was only fifteen miles away. A car would do it in half an hour. Can we say positively that she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) was away from Styles on the night of the murder?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot unexpectedly, <div class="bookquote">``we can. One of my first actions was to ring up the hospital where she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) was working.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I learnt that Miss Howard had been on afternoon duty on Tuesday, and that--a convoy coming in unexpectedly--she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) had kindly offered to remain on night duty, which offer was gratefully accepted. That disposes of that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, rather nonplussed. '' Really,'' I continued, <div class="bookquote">``it's her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) extraordinary vehemence against Inglethorp that started me off suspecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>). I can't help feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>)'d do anything against him (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>). And I had an idea she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) might know something about the destroying of the will. She (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) might have burnt the new one, mistaking it for the earlier one in his (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) favour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) is so terribly bitter against him (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You consider her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) vehemence unnatural?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Y--es. She (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) is so very violent. I wondered really whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) is quite sane on that point. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) head energetically. '' No, no, you are on a wrong tack there. There is nothing weak-minded or degenerate about Miss Howard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) is an excellent specimen of well-balanced English beef and brawn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) is sanity itself.'' <div class="bookquote">``Yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) hatred of Inglethorp seems almost a mania. My idea was--a very ridiculous one, no doubt--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) had intended to poison him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>)--and that, in some way, Mrs. Inglethorp got hold of it by mistake.
<p/>But I don't at all see how it could have been done. The whole thing is absurd and ridiculous to the last degree.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Still you are right in one thing. It is always wise to suspect everybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction, that they are innocent. Now, what reasons are there against Miss Howard's having deliberately poisoned Mrs. Inglethorp?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) was devoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed. '' Tcha! Tcha! '' cried Poirot irritably. '' You argue like a child. If Miss Howard were capable of poisoning the old lady, she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) would be quite equally capable of simulating devotion. No, we must look elsewhere. You are perfectly correct in your assumption that her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) vehemence against Alfred Inglethorp is too violent to be natural; but you are quite wrong in the deduction you draw from it. I have drawn my own deductions, which I believe to be correct, but I will not speak of them at present.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) paused a minute, then went on. '' Now, to my way of thinking, there is one insuperable objection to Miss Howard's being the murderess.'' <div class="bookquote">``And that is?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That in no possible way could Mrs. Inglethorp's death benefit Miss Howard. Now there is no murder without a motive. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I reflected. <div class="bookquote">``Could not Mrs. Inglethorp have made a will in her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) favour?''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) head. '' But you yourself suggested that possibility to Mr. Wells?'' Poirot smiled. <div class="bookquote">``That was for a reason. I did not want to mention the name of the person who was actually in my mind. Miss Howard occupied very much the same position, so I used her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) name instead.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Still, Mrs. Inglethorp might have done so. Why, that will, made on the afternoon of her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) death may--''
 (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div><p/>But Poirot's shake of the head was so energetic that I stopped. '' No, my friend. I have certain little ideas of my own about that will. But I can tell you this much--it was not in Miss Howard's favour. '' I accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) assurance, though I did not really see how he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could be so positive about the matter. '' Well,'' I said, with a sigh, <div class="bookquote">``we will acquit Miss Howard, then. It is partly your fault that I ever came to suspect her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>). It was what you said about her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) evidence at the inquest that set me off.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Poirot looked puzzled. <div class="bookquote">``What did I say about her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) evidence at the inquest?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't you remember? When I cited her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) and John Cavendish as being above suspicion?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh--ah--yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) seemed a little confused, but recovered himself. <div class="bookquote">``By the way, Hastings, there is something I want you to do for me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Certainly. What is it?'' ``Next time you happen to be alone with Lawrence Cavendish, I want you to say this to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>). ' I have a message for you, from Poirot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>' Nothing more. Nothing less.'' ''`Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.' Is that right? '' I asked, much mystified. <div class="bookquote">``Excellent.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But what does it mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that I will leave you to find out. You have access to the facts. Just say that to him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>), and see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) says. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well--but it's all extremely mysterious. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>We were running into Tadminster now, and Poirot directed the car to the <div class="bookquote">``Analytical Chemist.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot hopped down briskly, and went inside. In a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was back again. '' There,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``That is all my business.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What were you doing there?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, in lively curiosity. <div class="bookquote">``I left something to be analysed.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, but what?'' <div class="bookquote">``The sample of cocoa I took from the saucepan in the bedroom.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But that has already been tested! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, stupefied. '' Dr. Bauerstein had it tested, and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there being strychnine in it.'' <div class="bookquote">``I know Dr. Bauerstein had it tested,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>replied Poirot quietly. '' Well, then?'' <div class="bookquote">``Well, I have a fancy for having it analysed again , that is all.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And not another word on the subject could I drag out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>). This proceeding of Poirot's, in respect of the cocoa, puzzled me intensely. I could see neither rhyme nor reason in it. However, my confidence in him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>), which at one time had rather waned, was fully restored since his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) belief in Alfred Inglethorp's innocence had been so triumphantly vindicated. The funeral of Mrs. Inglethorp took place the following day, and on Monday, as I came down to a late breakfast, John drew me aside, and informed me that Mr. Inglethorp was leaving that morning, to take up his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) quarters at the Stylites Arms until he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) should have completed his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) plans. '' And really it's a great relief to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>)'s going, Hastings,'' continued my honest friend. <div class="bookquote">``It was bad enough before, when we thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Hastings</b></font>)'d done it, but I'm hanged if it isn't worse now, when we all feel guilty for having been so down on the fellow. The fact is, we've treated him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) abominably. Of course, things did look black against him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). I don't see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we did. Still, there it is, we were in the wrong, and now there's a beastly feeling that one ought to make amends;
<p/>which is difficult, when one doesn't like the fellow a bit better than one did before. The whole thing's damned awkward! And I'm thankful he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s had the tact to take himself off. It's a good thing Styles wasn't the mater's to leave to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). Couldn't bear to think of the fellow lording it here. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s welcome to her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) money.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You'll be able to keep up the place all right? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. '' Oh, yes. There are the death duties, of course, but half my father's money goes with the place, and Lawrence will stay with us for the present, so there is his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) share as well. We shall be pinched at first, of course, because, as I once told you, I am in a bit of a hole financially myself. Still, the Johnnies will wait now.'' In the general relief at Inglethorp's approaching departure, we had the most genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy. Cynthia, whose young spirits were naturally buoyant, was looking quite her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) pretty self again, and we all, with the exception of Lawrence, who seemed unalterably gloomy and nervous, were quietly cheerful, at the opening of a new and hopeful future. The papers, of course, had been full of the tragedy. Glaring headlines, sandwiched biographies of every member of the household, subtle innuendoes, the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue. Nothing was spared us. It was a slack time. The war was momentarily inactive, and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in fashionable life: '' The Mysterious Affair at Styles'' was the topic of the moment. Naturally it was very annoying for the Cavendishes.
<p/>The house was constantly besieged by reporters, who were consistently denied admission, but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds, where they lay in wait with cameras, for any unwary members of the household. We all lived in a blast of publicity. The Scotland Yard men came and went, examining, questioning, lynx-eyed and reserved of tongue. Towards what end they were working, we did not know. Had they any clue, or would the whole thing remain in the category of undiscovered crimes? After breakfast, Dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously, and asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) might have a few words with me. '' Certainly. What is it, Dorcas?'' <div class="bookquote">``Well, it's just this, sir. You'll be seeing the Belgian gentleman to-day perhaps? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I nodded. '' Well, sir, you know how he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) asked me so particular if the mistress, or anyone else, had a green dress?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes. You have found one? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My interest was aroused. '' No, not that, sir. But since then I've remembered what the young gentlemen''--John and Lawrence were still the <div class="bookquote">``young gentlemen''  (<font color='red'><b>Lawrence/Monsieur Lawrence</b></font>)</div>to Dorcas--<div class="bookquote">``call the `dressing-up box.' It's up in the front attic, sir. A great chest, full of old clothes and fancy dresses, and what not. And it came to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst them. So, if you'd tell the Belgian gentleman--''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorcas/Mademoiselle Dorcas</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), Dorcas,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I promised. '' Thank you very much, sir. A very nice gentleman he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is, sir. And quite a different class from them two detectives from London, what goes prying about, and asking questions.
<p/>I don't hold with foreigners as a rule, but from what the newspapers say I make out as how these brave Belges isn't the ordinary run of foreigners, and certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s a most polite spoken gentleman.'' Dear old Dorcas! As she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) stood there, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) honest face upturned to mine, I thought what a fine specimen she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) was of the old-fashioned servant that is so fast dying out. I thought I might as well go down to the village at once, and look up Poirot; but I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) half-way, coming up to the house, and at once gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) Dorcas's message. '' Ah, the brave Dorcas! We will look at the chest, although--but no matter--we will examine it all the same. '' We entered the house by one of the windows. There was no one in the hall, and we went straight up to the attic. Sure enough, there was the chest, a fine old piece, all studded with brass nails, and full to overflowing with every imaginable type of garment. Poirot bundled everything out on the floor with scant ceremony. There were one or two green fabrics of varying shades; but Poirot shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) head over them all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) seemed somewhat apathetic in the search, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) expected no great results from it. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) gave an exclamation. <div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Look!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The chest was nearly empty, and there, reposing right at the bottom, was a magnificent black beard. '' Ohó! '' said Poirot. '' Ohó! '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) turned it over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) hands, examining it closely. <div class="bookquote">``New,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) remarked. '' Yes, quite new. '' After a moment's hesitation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) replaced it in the chest, heaped all the other things on top of it as before, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) way briskly downstairs.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) went straight to the pantry, where we found Dorcas busily polishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) silver. Poirot wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) good morning with Gallic politeness, and went on: <div class="bookquote">``We have been looking through that chest, Dorcas. I am much obliged to you for mentioning it. There is, indeed, a fine collection there. Are they often used, may I ask?''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, not very often nowadays, though from time to time we do have what the young gentlemen call 'a dress-up night.' And very funny it is sometimes, sir. Mr. Lawrence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>)'s wonderful. Most comic! I shall never forget the night he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) came down as the Char of Persia, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) called it--a sort of Eastern King it was. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had the big paper knife in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hand, and `Mind, Dorcas,' he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) says, `you'll have to be very respectful. This is my specially sharpened scimitar, and it's off with your head if I'm at all displeased with you!' Miss Cynthia, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was what they call an Apache, or some such name--a Frenchified sort of cut-throat, I take it to be. A real sight she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) looked. You'd never have believed a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into such a ruffian. Nobody would have known her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``These evenings must have been great fun,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot genially. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose Mr. Lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) was Shah of Persia?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) did have a beard, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorcas/Mademoiselle Dorcas</b></font>)</div>replied Dorcas, smiling. '' And well I know it, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with! And I'm sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance. I didn't know as there was a beard up there at all. It must have been got quite lately, I think.
<p/>There was a red wig, I know, but nothing else in the way of hair. Burnt corks they use mostly-- though 'tis messy getting it off again. Miss Cynthia was a nigger once, and, oh, the trouble she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had.'' <div class="bookquote">``So Dorcas knows nothing about that black beard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot thoughtfully, as we walked out into the hall again. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think it is the one? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered eagerly. Poirot nodded. <div class="bookquote">``I do. You notice it had been trimmed?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. It was cut exactly the shape of Mr. Inglethorp's, and I found one or two snipped hairs. Hastings, this affair is very deep.'' <div class="bookquote">``Who put it in the chest, I wonder?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Someone with a good deal of intelligence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>remarked Poirot dryly. <div class="bookquote">``You realize that he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) chose the one place in the house to hide it where its presence would not be remarked? Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) is intelligent. But we must be more intelligent. We must be so intelligent that he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) does not suspect us of being intelligent at all. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I acquiesced. <div class="bookquote">``There, mon ami , you will be of great assistance to me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was pleased with the compliment. There had been times when I hardly thought that Poirot appreciated me at my true worth. '' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) continued, staring at me thoughtfully, <div class="bookquote">``you will be invaluable. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>This was naturally gratifying, but Poirot's next words were not so welcome. <div class="bookquote">``I must have an ally in the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) observed reflectively. <div class="bookquote">``You have me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I protested. '' True, but you are not sufficient. '' I was hurt, and showed it. Poirot hurried to explain himself. <div class="bookquote">``You do not quite take my meaning. You are known to be working with me. I want somebody who is not associated with us in any way.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I see.
<p/>How about John?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I think not.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The dear fellow isn't perhaps very bright,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``Here comes Miss Howard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) is the very person. But I am in her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) black books, since I cleared Mr. Inglethorp. Still, we can but try. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Howard</b></font>)</div>With a nod that was barely civil, Miss Howard assented to Poirot's request for a few minutes' conversation. We went into the little morning-room, and Poirot closed the door. '' Well, Monsieur Poirot,'' said Miss Howard impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``what is it? Out with it. I'm busy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Howard</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember, mademoiselle, that I once asked you to help me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div>The lady nodded. '' And I told you I'd help you with pleasure--to hang Alfred Inglethorp.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot studied her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seriously. '' Miss Howard, I will ask you one question. I beg of you to reply to it truthfully.'' <div class="bookquote">``Never tell lies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Howard</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Howard. <div class="bookquote">``It is this. Do you still believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) husband?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) asked sharply. <div class="bookquote">``You needn't think your pretty explanations influence me in the slightest. I'll admit that it wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) who bought strychnine at the chemist's shop. What of that? I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) soaked fly paper, as I told you at the beginning.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is arsenic--not strychnine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot mildly. <div class="bookquote">``What does that matter? Arsenic would put poor Emily out of the way just as well as strychnine. If I'm convinced he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) did it, it doesn't matter a jot to me how he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) did it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Exactly. If you are convinced he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) did it,'' said Poirot quietly. <div class="bookquote">``I will put my question in another form. Did you ever in your heart of hearts believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) husband?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Howard</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Howard. <div class="bookquote">``Haven't I always told you the man is a villain? Haven't I always told you he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would murder her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) bed? Haven't I always hated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) like poison?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot. '' That bears out my little idea entirely.'' <div class="bookquote">``What little idea?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Miss Howard, do you remember a conversation that took place on the day of my friend's arrival here? He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) repeated it to me, and there is a sentence of yours that has impressed me very much. Do you remember affirming that if a crime had been committed, and anyone you loved had been murdered, you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the criminal was, even if you were quite unable to prove it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I remember saying that. I believe it too. I suppose you think it nonsense?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at all.''

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot curtly. <div class="bookquote">``Because your instinct is not against Mr. Inglethorp.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. You wish to believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) committed the crime. You believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) capable of committing it. But your instinct tells you he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) did not commit it. It tells you more--shall I go on?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>), fascinated, and made a slight affirmative movement of the hand. '' Shall I tell you why you have been so vehement against Mr. Inglethorp? It is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe. It is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct, which tells you another name--'' '' No, no, no!'' cried Miss Howard wildly, flinging up her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``Don't say it! Oh, don't say it! It isn't true! It can't be true. I don't know what put such a wild--such a dreadful--idea into my head!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am right, am I not? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>asked Poirot. '' Yes, yes; you must be a wizard to have guessed. But it can't be so--it's too monstrous, too impossible. It must be Alfred Inglethorp. '' Poirot shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) head gravely. '' Don't ask me about it,'' continued Miss Howard, <div class="bookquote">``because I shan't tell you. I won't admit it, even to myself. I must be mad to think of such a thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Howard</b></font>)</div>Poirot nodded, as if satisfied. <div class="bookquote">``I will ask you nothing. It is enough for me that it is as I thought.

'' Yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) said quietly, <div class="bookquote">``that was not Evelyn Howard who spoke!''

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I think it is very unfair to keep back facts from me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am not keeping back facts. Every fact that I know is in your possession. You can draw your own deductions from them. This time it is a question of ideas.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Still, it would be interesting to know. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot looked at me very earnestly, and again shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said sadly, '' you have no instincts.'' <div class="bookquote">``It was intelligence you were requiring just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pointed out. '' The two often go together,'' said Poirot enigmatically. The remark seemed so utterly irrelevant that I did not even take the trouble to answer it. But I decided that if I made any interesting and important discoveries--as no doubt I should--I would keep them to myself, and surprise Poirot with the ultimate result. There are times when it is one's duty to assert oneself. CHAPTER IX. DR. BAUERSTEIN
<p/>I HAD had no opportunity as yet of passing on Poirot's message to Lawrence. But now, as I strolled out on the lawn, still nursing a grudge against my friend's high-handedness, I saw Lawrence on the croquet lawn, aimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about, with a still more ancient mallet. It struck me that it would be a good opportunity to deliver my message. Otherwise, Poirot himself might relieve me of it. It was true that I did not quite gather its purport, but I flattered myself that by Lawrence's reply, and perhaps a little skillful cross-examination on my part, I should soon perceive its significance. Accordingly I accosted him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I've been looking for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked untruthfully. '' Have you?'' '' Yes. The truth is, I've got a message for you--from Poirot.'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) told me to wait until I was alone with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, dropping my voice significantly, and watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) intently out of the corner of my eye. I have always been rather good at what is called, I believe, creating an atmosphere. '' Well? '' There was no change of expression in the dark melancholic face. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) any idea of what I was about to say? <div class="bookquote">``This is the message. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I dropped my voice still lower. '' `Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.''' <div class="bookquote">``What on earth does he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) mean? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lawrence/Monsieur Lawrence</b></font>)</div>Lawrence stared at me in quite unaffected astonishment. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least. Do you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was compelled to shake my head. <div class="bookquote">``What extra coffee-cup?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>)'d better ask Dorcas, or one of the maids, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) wants to know about coffee-cups. It's their business, not mine.
<p/>I don't know anything about the coffee-cups, except that we've got some that are never used, which are a perfect dream! Old Worcester. You're not a connoisseur, are you, Hastings? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shook my head. '' You miss a lot. A really perfect bit of old china--it's pure delight to handle it, or even to look at it.'' <div class="bookquote">``Well, what am I to tell Poirot?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) I don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>)'s talking about. It's double Dutch to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All right. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was moving off towards the house again when he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) suddenly called me back. <div class="bookquote">``I say, what was the end of that message? Say it over again, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>''`Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.' Are you sure you don't know what it means? '' I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) earnestly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) head. '' No,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said musingly, <div class="bookquote">``I don't. I--I wish I did. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The boom of the gong sounded from the house, and we went in together. Poirot had been asked by John to remain to lunch, and was already seated at the table. By tacit consent, all mention of the tragedy was barred. We conversed on the war, and other outside topics. But after the cheese and biscuits had been handed round, and Dorcas had left the room, Poirot suddenly leant forward to Mrs. Cavendish. '' Pardon me, madame, for recalling unpleasant memories, but I have a little idea''--Poirot's <div class="bookquote">``little ideas''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>were becoming a perfect byword--<div class="bookquote">``and would like to ask one or two questions.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of me? Certainly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are too amiable, madame. What I want to ask is this: the door leading into Mrs. Inglethorp's room from that of Mademoiselle Cynthia, it was bolted, you say?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Certainly it was bolted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Cavendish</b></font>)</div>replied Mary Cavendish, rather surprised. <div class="bookquote">``I said so at the inquest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bolted?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) looked perplexed. <div class="bookquote">``I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>explained Poirot, <div class="bookquote">``you are sure it was bolted, and not merely locked?''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I see what you mean. No, I don't know. I said bolted, meaning that it was fastened, and I could not open it, but I believe all the doors were found bolted on the inside.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Still, as far as you are concerned, the door might equally well have been locked?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You yourself did not happen to notice, madame, when you entered Mrs. Inglethorp's room, whether that door was bolted or not?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I--I believe it was.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you did not see it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. I--never looked.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lawrence/Monsieur Lawrence</b></font>)</div>interrupted Lawrence suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``I happened to notice that it was bolted.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that settles it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>And Poirot looked crestfallen. I could not help rejoicing that, for once, one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``little ideas''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>had come to naught. After lunch Poirot begged me to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) home. I consented rather stiffly. '' You are annoyed, is it not so?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) asked anxiously, as we walked through the park. '' Not at all,'' I said coldly. <div class="bookquote">``That is well. That lifts a great load from my mind. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>This was not quite what I had intended. I had hoped that he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) would have observed the stiffness of my manner. Still, the fervour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) words went towards the appeasing of my just displeasure. I thawed. <div class="bookquote">``I gave Lawrence your message,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``And what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) say? He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) was entirely puzzled?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. I am quite sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) had no idea of what you meant. '' I had expected Poirot to be disappointed; but, to my surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) replied that that was as he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) had thought, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was very glad. My pride forbade me to ask any questions.
<p/>Poirot switched off on another tack. '' Mademoiselle Cynthia was not at lunch to-day? How was that?'' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is at the hospital again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) resumed work to-day.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is an industrious little demoiselle. And pretty too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is like pictures I have seen in Italy. I would rather like to see that dispensary of hers. Do you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would show it to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would be delighted. It's an interesting little place.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Does she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) go there every day?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) has all Wednesdays off, and comes back to lunch on Saturdays. Those are her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) only times off.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will remember. Women are doing great work nowadays, and Mademoiselle Cynthia is clever-- oh, yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) has brains, that little one.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) has passed quite a stiff exam.'' <div class="bookquote">``Without doubt. After all, it is very responsible work. I suppose they have very strong poisons there?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) showed them to us. They are kept locked up in a little cupboard. I believe they have to be very careful. They always take out the key before leaving the room.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Indeed. It is near the window, this cupboard?'' <div class="bookquote">``No, right the other side of the room. Why? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``I wondered. That is all. Will you come in? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We had reached the cottage. '' No. I think I'll be getting back. I shall go round the long way through the woods. '' The woods round Styles were very beautiful. After the walk across the open park, it was pleasant to saunter lazily through the cool glades. There was hardly a breath of wind, the very chirp of the birds was faint and subdued.
<p/>I strolled on a little way, and finally flung myself down at the foot of a grand old beech-tree. My thoughts of mankind were kindly and charitable. I even forgave Poirot for his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) absurd secrecy. In fact, I was at peace with the world. Then I yawned. I thought about the crime, and it struck me as being very unreal and far off. I yawned again. Probably, I thought, it really never happened. Of course, it was all a bad dream. The truth of the matter was that it was Lawrence who had murdered Alfred Inglethorp with a croquet mallet. But it was absurd of John to make such a fuss about it, and to go shouting out: <div class="bookquote">``I tell you I won't have it!''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>I woke up with a start. At once I realized that I was in a very awkward predicament. For, about twelve feet away from me, John and Mary Cavendish were standing facing each other, and they were evidently quarrelling. And, quite as evidently, they were unaware of my vicinity, for before I could move or speak John repeated the words which had aroused me from my dream. <div class="bookquote">``I tell you, Mary, I won't have it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Cavendish</b></font>)</div>Mary's voice came, cool and liquid: <div class="bookquote">``Have you any right to criticize my actions?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Cavendish</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It will be the talk of the village! My mother was only buried on Saturday, and here you are gadding about with the fellow.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shoulders, <div class="bookquote">``if it is only village gossip that you mind!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But it isn't. I've had enough of the fellow hanging about. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s a Polish Jew, anyway.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A tinge of Jewish blood is not a bad thing. It leavens the'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``stolid stupidity of the ordinary Englishman. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Fire in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes, ice in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice.
<p/>I did not wonder that the blood rose to John's face in a crimson tide. '' Mary!'' <div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tone did not change. The pleading died out of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) voice. '' Am I to understand that you will continue to see Bauerstein against my express wishes?'' '' If I choose.'' <div class="bookquote">``You defy me?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' No, but I deny your right to criticize my actions. Have you no friends of whom I should disapprove?'' John fell back a pace. The colour ebbed slowly from his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, in an unsteady voice. <div class="bookquote">``You see!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Cavendish</b></font>)</div>said Mary quietly. <div class="bookquote">``You do see, don't you, that you have no right to dictate to me as to the choice of my friends?''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>John glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pleadingly, a stricken look on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) face. '' No right? Have I no right, Mary?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said unsteadily. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hands. '' Mary-- '' For a moment, I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wavered. A softer expression came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face, then suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) turned almost fiercely away. <div class="bookquote">``None!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was walking away when John sprang after her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) by the arm. <div class="bookquote">``Mary'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>--his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) voice was very quiet now--<div class="bookquote">``are you in love with this fellow Bauerstein?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hesitated, and suddenly there swept across her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face a strange expression, old as the hills, yet with something eternally young about it. So might some Egyptian sphinx have smiled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) freed herself quietly from his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) arm, and spoke over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) shoulder. '' Perhaps,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said; and then swiftly passed out of the little glade, leaving John standing there as though he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had been turned to stone. Rather ostentatiously, I stepped forward, crackling some dead branches with my feet as I did so. John turned.
<p/>Luckily, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) took it for granted that I had only just come upon the scene. '' Hullo, Hastings. Have you seen the little fellow safely back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hastings</b></font>) cottage? Quaint little chap! Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Hastings</b></font>) any good, though, really?'' <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hastings</b></font>) was considered one of the finest detectives of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hastings</b></font>) day.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, I suppose there must be something in it, then. What a rotten world it is, though!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You find it so? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. '' Good Lord, yes! There's this terrible business to start with. Scotland Yard men in and out of the house like a jack-in-the-box! Never know where they won't turn up next. Screaming headlines in every paper in the country-- damn all journalists, I say! Do you know there was a whole crowd staring in at the lodge gates this morning. Sort of Madame Tussaud's chamber of horrors business that can be seen for nothing. Pretty thick, isn't it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Cheer up, John!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said soothingly. <div class="bookquote">``It can't last for ever.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can't it, though? It can last long enough for us never to be able to hold up our heads again.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no, you're getting morbid on the subject.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Enough to make a man morbid, to be stalked by beastly journalists and stared at by gaping moon-faced idiots, wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes! But there's worse than that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>John lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) voice: <div class="bookquote">``Have you ever thought, Hastings--it's a nightmare to me--who did it? I can't help feeling sometimes it must have been an accident. Because--because--who could have done it? Now Inglethorp's out of the way, there's no one else; no one, I mean, except--one of us.''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>Yes, indeed, that was nightmare enough for any man! One of us? Yes, surely it must be so, unless----- A new idea suggested itself to my mind. Rapidly, I considered it.
<p/>The light increased. Poirot's mysterious doings, his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) hints--they all fitted in. Fool that I was not to have thought of this possibility before, and what a relief for us all. '' No, John,'' I said, <div class="bookquote">``it isn't one of us. How could it be?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know, but, still, who else is there?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can't you guess?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked cautiously round, and lowered my voice. '' Dr. Bauerstein! '' I whispered. <div class="bookquote">``Impossible!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But what earthly interest could he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) have in my mother's death?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That I don't see,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I confessed, <div class="bookquote">``but I'll tell you this: Poirot thinks so.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Poirot? Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>)? How do you know? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) of Poirot's intense excitement on hearing that Dr. Bauerstein had been at Styles on the fatal night, and added: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said twice: `That alters everything.' And I've been thinking. You know Inglethorp said he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) had put down the coffee in the hall? Well, it was just then that Bauerstein arrived. Isn't it possible that, as Inglethorp brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) through the hall, the doctor dropped something into the coffee in passing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Bauerstein/Bauerstein</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``H'm,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>said John. <div class="bookquote">``It would have been very risky.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, but it was possible.'' <div class="bookquote">``And then, how could he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) know it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) coffee? No, old fellow, I don't think that will wash.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But I had remembered something else. <div class="bookquote">``You're quite right. That wasn't how it was done. Listen. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And I then told him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) of the cocoa sample which Poirot had taken to be analysed. John interrupted just as I had done. '' But, look here, Bauerstein had had it analysed already?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, that's the point. I didn't see it either until now. Don't you understand? Bauerstein had it analysed--that's just it!
<p/>If Bauerstein's the murderer, nothing could be simpler than for him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) to substitute some ordinary cocoa for his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) sample, and send that to be tested. And of course they would find no strychnine! But no one would dream of suspecting Bauerstein, or think of taking another sample--except Poirot,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I added, with belated recognition. '' Yes, but what about the bitter taste that cocoa won't disguise?'' <div class="bookquote">``Well, we've only his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) word for that. And there are other possibilities. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>)'s admittedly one of the world's greatest toxicologists--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``One of the world's greatest what? Say it again.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) knows more about poisons than almost anybody,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I explained. <div class="bookquote">``Well, my idea is, that perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>)'s found some way of making strychnine tasteless. Or it may not have been strychnine at all, but some obscure drug no one has ever heard of, which produces much the same symptoms.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``H'm, yes, that might be,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>said John. <div class="bookquote">``But look here, how could he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) have got at the cocoa? That wasn't downstairs?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, it wasn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted reluctantly. And then, suddenly, a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind. I hoped and prayed it would not occur to John also. I glanced sideways at him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was frowning perplexedly, and I drew a deep breath of relief, for the terrible thought that had flashed across my mind was this: that Dr. Bauerstein might have had an accomplice. Yet surely it could not be! Surely no woman as beautiful as Mary Cavendish could be a murderess. Yet beautiful women had been known to poison. And suddenly I remembered that first conversation at tea on the day of my arrival, and the gleam in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) had said that poison was a woman's weapon. How agitated she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) had been on that fatal Tuesday evening!
<p/>Had Mrs. Inglethorp discovered something between her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) and Bauerstein, and threatened to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) husband? Was it to stop that denunciation that the crime had been committed? Then I remembered that enigmatical conversation between Poirot and Evelyn Howard. Was this what they had meant? Was this the monstrous possibility that Evelyn had tried not to believe? Yes, it all fitted in. No wonder Miss Howard had suggested <div class="bookquote">``hushing it up.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Howard</b></font>)</div>Now I understood that unfinished sentence of hers: <div class="bookquote">``Emily herself--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And in my heart I agreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>). Would not Mrs. Inglethorp have preferred to go unavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name of Cavendish. <div class="bookquote">``There's another thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>said John suddenly, and the unexpected sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) voice made me start guiltily. '' Something which makes me doubt if what you say can be true.'' <div class="bookquote">``What's that? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, thankful that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had gone away from the subject of how the poison could have been introduced into the cocoa. '' Why, the fact that Bauerstein demanded a post-mortem. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) needn't have done so. Little Wilkins would have been quite content to let it go at heart disease.'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said doubtfully. <div class="bookquote">``But we don't know. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) thought it safer in the long run. Someone might have talked afterwards. Then the Home Office might have ordered exhumation. The whole thing would have come out, then, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would have been in an awkward position, for no one would have believed that a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reputation could have been deceived into calling it heart disease.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>admitted John. '' Still,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I'm blest if I can see what his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) motive could have been. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I trembled. '' Look here,'' I said, <div class="bookquote">``I may be altogether wrong.
<p/>And, remember, all this is in confidence.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, of course--that goes without saying. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We had walked, as we talked, and now we passed through the little gate into the garden. Voices rose near at hand, for tea was spread out under the sycamore-tree, as it had been on the day of my arrival. Cynthia was back from the hospital, and I placed my chair beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) of Poirot's wish to visit the dispensary. '' Of course! I'd love him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) to see it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>)'d better come to tea there one day. I must fix it up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>)'s such a dear little man! But he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) is funny. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) made me take the brooch out of my tie the other day, and put it in again, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said it wasn't straight. '' I laughed. <div class="bookquote">``It's quite a mania with him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, isn't it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Cavendish</b></font>)</div>We were silent for a minute or two, and then, glancing in the direction of Mary Cavendish, and dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) voice, Cynthia said: <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hastings.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``After tea, I want to talk to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Cavendish</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) glance at Mary had set me thinking. I fancied that between these two there existed very little sympathy. For the first time, it occurred to me to wonder about the girl's future. Mrs. Inglethorp had made no provisions of any kind for her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>), but I imagined that John and Mary would probably insist on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) making her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) home with them--at any rate until the end of the war. John, I knew, was very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and would be sorry to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) go. John, who had gone into the house, now reappeared. His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) good-natured face wore an unaccustomed frown of anger. '' Confound those detectives! I can't think what they're after!
<p/>They've been in every room in the house--turning things inside out, and upside down. It really is too bad! I suppose they took advantage of our all being out. I shall go for that fellow Japp, when I next see him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)!'' <div class="bookquote">``Lot of Paul Prys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Howard</b></font>)</div>grunted Miss Howard. Lawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something. Mary Cavendish said nothing. After tea, I invited Cynthia to come for a walk, and we sauntered off into the woods together. '' Well?'' I inquired, as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by the leafy screen. With a sigh, Cynthia flung herself down, and tossed off her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hat. The sunlight, piercing through the branches, turned the auburn of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hair to quivering gold. '' Mr. Hastings--you are always so kind, and you know such a lot. '' It struck me at this moment that Cynthia was really a very charming girl! Much more charming than Mary, who never said things of that kind. '' Well? '' I asked benignantly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``I want to ask your advice. What shall I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. You see, Aunt Emily always told me I should be provided for. I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) forgot, or didn't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) was likely to die--anyway, I am not provided for! And I don't know what to do. Do you think I ought to go away from here at once?'' <div class="bookquote">``Good heavens, no! They don't want to part with you, I'm sure. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>Cynthia hesitated a moment, plucking up the grass with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) tiny hands. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Cavendish does. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) hates me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hates you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, astonished. Cynthia nodded. '' Yes. I don't know why, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) can't bear me; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) can't, either. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There I know you're wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said warmly. <div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, John is very fond of you.''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, yes-- John . I meant Lawrence. Not, of course, that I care whether Lawrence hates me or not. Still, it's rather horrid when no one loves you, isn't it?'' <div class="bookquote">``But they do, Cynthia dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you are mistaken. Look, there is John--and Miss Howard-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>Cynthia nodded rather gloomily. '' Yes, John likes me, I think, and of course Evie, for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) gruff ways, wouldn't be unkind to a fly. But Lawrence never speaks to me if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) can help it, and Mary can hardly bring herself to be civil to me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wants Evie to stay on, is begging her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) to, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) doesn't want me, and--and--I don't know what to do.'' Suddenly the poor child burst out crying. I don't know what possessed me. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) beauty, perhaps, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) sat there, with the sunlight glinting down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) head; perhaps the sense of relief at encountering someone who so obviously could have no connection with the tragedy; perhaps honest pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) youth and loneliness. Anyway, I leant forward, and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) little hand, I said awkwardly: <div class="bookquote">``Marry me, Cynthia.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Unwittingly, I had hit upon a sovereign remedy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) tears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sat up at once, drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hand away, and said, with some asperity: <div class="bookquote">``Don't be silly! ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>I was a little annoyed. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not being silly. I am asking you to do me the honour of becoming my wife. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>To my intense surprise, Cynthia burst out laughing, and called me a <div class="bookquote">``funny dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's perfectly sweet of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said, '' but you know you don't want to!'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do. I've got-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never mind what you've got.
<p/>You don't really want to--and I don't either.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, of course, that settles it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said stiffly. <div class="bookquote">``But I don't see anything to laugh at. There's nothing funny about a proposal.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``Somebody might accept you next time. Good-bye, you've cheered me up very much.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And, with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) vanished through the trees. Thinking over the interview, it struck me as being profoundly unsatisfactory. It occurred to me suddenly that I would go down to the village, and look up Bauerstein. Somebody ought to be keeping an eye on the fellow. At the same time, it would be wise to allay any suspicions he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) might have as to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) being suspected. I remembered how Poirot had relied on my diplomacy. Accordingly, I went to the little house with the <div class="bookquote">``Apartments''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>card inserted in the window, where I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) lodged, and tapped on the door. An old woman came and opened it. '' Good afternoon,'' I said pleasantly. '' Is Dr. Bauerstein in?'' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stared at me. '' Haven't you heard?'' <div class="bookquote">``Heard what?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``About him (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What about him (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>)'s took.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Took? Dead?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, took by the perlice.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``By the police!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gasped. '' Do you mean they've arrested him (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's it, and-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I waited to hear no more, but tore up the village to find Poirot. CHAPTER X. THE ARREST To my extreme annoyance , Poirot was not in, and the old Belgian who answered my knock informed me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) had gone to London. I was dumbfounded. What on earth could Poirot be doing in London! Was it a sudden decision on his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) part, or had he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) already made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) mind when he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) parted from me a few hours earlier?
<p/>I retraced my steps to Styles in some annoyance. With Poirot away, I was uncertain how to act. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) foreseen this arrest? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) not, in all probability, been the cause of it? Those questions I could not resolve. But in the meantime what was I to do? Should I announce the arrest openly at Styles, or not? Though I did not acknowledge it to myself, the thought of Mary Cavendish was weighing on me. Would it not be a terrible shock to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>)? For the moment, I set aside utterly any suspicions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) could not be implicated--otherwise I should have heard some hint of it. Of course, there was no possibility of being able permanently to conceal Dr. Bauerstein's arrest from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>). It would be announced in every newspaper on the morrow. Still, I shrank from blurting it out. If only Poirot had been accessible, I could have asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) advice. What possessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) to go posting off to London in this unaccountable way? In spite of myself, my opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) sagacity was immeasurably heightened. I would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor, had not Poirot put it into my head. Yes, decidedly, the little man was clever. After some reflecting, I decided to take John into my confidence, and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to make the matter public or not, as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) thought fit. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) gave vent to a prodigious whistle, as I imparted the news. '' Great Scot! You were right, then. I couldn't believe it at the time.'' <div class="bookquote">``No, it is astonishing until you get used to the idea, and see how it makes everything fit in. Now, what are we to do? Of course, it will be generally known to-morrow.''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>John reflected. ''
<p/>Never mind,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``we won't say anything at present. There is no need. As you say, it will be known soon enough.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But to my intense surprise, on getting down early the next morning, and eagerly opening the newspapers, there was not a word about the arrest! There was a column of mere padding about <div class="bookquote">``The Styles Poisoning Case,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>but nothing further. It was rather inexplicable, but I supposed that, for some reason or other, Japp wished to keep it out of the papers. It worried me just a little, for it suggested the possibility that there might be further arrests to come. After breakfast, I decided to go down to the village, and see if Poirot had returned yet; but, before I could start, a well-known face blocked one of the windows, and the well-known voice said: '' Bonjour, mon ami! '' <div class="bookquote">``Poirot,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed, with relief, and seizing him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) by both hands, I dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) into the room. <div class="bookquote">``I was never so glad to see anyone. Listen, I have said nothing to anybody but John. Is that right?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>replied Poirot, <div class="bookquote">``I do not know what you are talking about.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dr. Bauerstein's arrest, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered impatiently. '' Is Bauerstein arrested, then?'' <div class="bookquote">``Did you not know it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not the least in the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But, pausing a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``Still, it does not surprise me. After all, we are only four miles from the coast.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The coast? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, puzzled. <div class="bookquote">``What has that got to do with it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) shoulders. '' Surely, it is obvious!'' <div class="bookquote">``Not to me. No doubt I am very dense, but I cannot see what the proximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing at all, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>replied Poirot, smiling. '' But we were speaking of the arrest of Dr. Bauerstein.'' <div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) is arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp--''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>cried Poirot, in apparently lively astonishment. '' Dr. Bauerstein arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Impossible! That would be too good a farce! Who told you that, my friend?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, no one exactly told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I confessed. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is arrested.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, very likely. But for espionage, mon ami .''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Espionage?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gasped. '' Precisely.'' <div class="bookquote">``Not for poisoning Mrs. Inglethorp?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not unless our friend Japp has taken leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) senses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>replied Poirot placidly. '' But--but I thought you thought so too?'' Poirot gave me one look, which conveyed a wondering pity, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) full sense of the utter absurdity of such an idea. '' Do you mean to say,'' I asked, slowly adapting myself to the new idea, <div class="bookquote">``that Dr. Bauerstein is a spy?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Poirot nodded. '' Have you never suspected it?'' <div class="bookquote">``It never entered my head.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It did not strike you as peculiar that a famous London doctor should bury himself in a little village like this, and should be in the habit of walking about at all hours of the night, fully dressed?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I confessed, <div class="bookquote">``I never thought of such a thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is, of course, a German by birth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot thoughtfully, <div class="bookquote">``though he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) has practiced so long in this country that nobody thinks of him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) as anything but an Englishman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) was naturalized about fifteen years ago. A very clever man--a Jew, of course.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The blackguard! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried indignantly. '' Not at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) is, on the contrary, a patriot. Think what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) stands to lose. I admire the man myself.''
<p/>But I could not look at it in Poirot's philosophical way. '' And this is the man with whom Mrs. Cavendish has been wandering about all over the country! '' I cried indignantly. '' Yes. I should fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) very useful,'' remarked Poirot. '' So long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together, any other vagaries of the doctor's passed unobserved.'' <div class="bookquote">``Then you think he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) never really cared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>)? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked eagerly--rather too eagerly, perhaps, under the circumstances. <div class="bookquote">``That, of course, I cannot say, but--shall I tell you my own private opinion, Hastings?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, it is this: that Mrs. Cavendish does not care, and never has cared one little jot about Dr. Bauerstein!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you really think so? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could not disguise my pleasure. <div class="bookquote">``I am quite sure of it. And I will tell you why.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) cares for someone else, mon ami .''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Hastings</b></font>) mean? In spite of myself, an agreeable warmth spread over me. I am not a vain man where women are concerned, but I remembered certain evidences, too lightly thought of at the time, perhaps, but which certainly seemed to indicate-- My pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of Miss Howard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in the room, and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper. This she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) handed to Poirot, murmuring as she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) did so the cryptic words: <div class="bookquote">``On top of the wardrobe. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) hurriedly left the room. Poirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly, and uttered an exclamation of satisfaction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) spread it out on the table. '' Come here, Hastings. Now tell me, what is that initial--J. or L.?
<p/>'' It was a medium sized sheet of paper, rather dusty, as though it had lain by for some time. But it was the label that was attracting Poirot's attention. At the top, it bore the printed stamp of Messrs. Parkson's, the well-known theatrical costumiers, and it was addressed to ''---LRB-the debatable initial-RRB- Cavendish, Esq., Styles Court, Styles St. Mary, Essex.'' <div class="bookquote">``It might be T., or it might be L.,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, after studying the thing for a minute or two. <div class="bookquote">``It certainly isn't a J.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>replied Poirot, folding up the paper again. <div class="bookquote">``I, also, am of your way of thinking. It is an L., depend upon it!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where did it come from? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked curiously. '' Is it important?'' '' Moderately so. It confirms a surmise of mine. Having deduced its existence, I set Miss Howard to search for it, and, as you see, she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) has been successful.'' <div class="bookquote">``What did she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) mean by ' On the top of the wardrobe'?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) meant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>replied Poirot promptly, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) found it on top of a wardrobe.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A funny place for a piece of brown paper,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I mused. <div class="bookquote">``Not at all. The top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for brown paper and cardboard boxes. I have kept them there myself. Neatly arranged, there is nothing to offend the eye.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Poirot,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked earnestly, <div class="bookquote">``have you made up your mind about this crime?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes--that is to say, I believe I know how it was committed.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Unfortunately, I have no proof beyond my surmise, unless-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With sudden energy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) caught me by the arm, and whirled me down the hall, calling out in French in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) excitement: <div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle Dorcas, Mademoiselle Dorcas, un moment, s`il vous plaît! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorcas, quite flurried by the noise, came hurrying out of the pantry. '' My good Dorcas, I have an idea--a little idea--if it should prove justified, what magnificent chance! Tell me, on Monday, not Tuesday, Dorcas, but Monday, the day before the tragedy, did anything go wrong with Mrs. Inglethorp's bell?'' Dorcas looked very surprised. '' Yes, sir, now you mention it, it did; though I don't know how you came to hear of it. A mouse, or some such, must have nibbled the wire through. The man came and put it right on Tuesday morning.'' With a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy, Poirot led the way back to the morning-room. '' See you, one should not ask for outside proof--no, reason should be enough. But the flesh is weak, it is consolation to find that one is on the right track. Ah, my friend, I am like a giant refreshed. I run! I leap!'' And, in very truth, run and leap he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did, gambolling wildly down the stretch of lawn outside the long window. <div class="bookquote">``What is your remarkable little friend doing? ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>asked a voice behind me, and I turned to find Mary Cavendish at my elbow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) smiled, and so did I. '' What is it all about?'' <div class="bookquote">``Really, I can't tell you. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) asked Dorcas some question about a bell, and appeared so delighted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) answer that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is capering about as you see!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Cavendish</b></font>)</div>Mary laughed. <div class="bookquote">``How ridiculous! He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s going out of the gate. Isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) coming back to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) quite mad, Mr. Hastings?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I honestly don't know.
<p/>Sometimes, I feel sure he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is as mad as a hatter; and then, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is at his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) maddest, I find there is method in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) madness.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I see. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Cavendish</b></font>)</div>In spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>hatter</b></font>) laugh, Mary was looking thoughtful this morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) seemed grave, almost sad. It occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) on the subject of Cynthia. I began rather tactfully, I thought, but I had not gone far before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stopped me authoritatively. <div class="bookquote">``You are an excellent advocate, I have no doubt, Mr. Hastings, but in this case your talents are quite thrown away. Cynthia will run no risk of encountering any unkindness from me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I began to stammer feebly that I hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hadn't thought--But again she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) stopped me, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) words were so unexpected that they quite drove Cynthia, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) troubles, out of my mind. '' Mr. Hastings,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``do you think I and my husband are happy together? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I was considerably taken aback, and murmured something about it's not being my business to think anything of the sort. '' Well,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said quietly, <div class="bookquote">``whether it is your business or not, I will tell you that we are not happy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I said nothing, for I saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had not finished. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) began slowly, walking up and down the room, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) head a little bent, and that slim, supple figure of hers swaying gently as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) walked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) stopped suddenly, and looked up at me. <div class="bookquote">``You don't know anything about me, do you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Where I come from, who I was before I married John--anything, in fact? Well, I will tell you. I will make a father confessor of you. You are kind, I think--yes, I am sure you are kind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Somehow, I was not quite as elated as I might have been. I remembered that Cynthia had begun her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) confidences in much the same way. Besides, a father confessor should be elderly, it is not at all the role for a young man. <div class="bookquote">``My father was English,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cavendish, <div class="bookquote">``but my mother was a Russian.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cavendish</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``now I understand--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Understand what?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A hint of something foreign--different--that there has always been about you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My mother was very beautiful, I believe. I don't know, because I never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died when I was quite a little child. I believe there was some tragedy connected with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) death--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) took an overdose of some sleeping draught by mistake. However that may be, my father was broken-hearted. Shortly afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went into the Consular Service. Everywhere he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went, I went with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). When I was twenty-three, I had been nearly all over the world. It was a splendid life--I loved it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a smile on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head was thrown back. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seemed living in the memory of those old glad days. '' Then my father died. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) left me very badly off. I had to go and live with some old aunts in Yorkshire. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shuddered. <div class="bookquote">``You will understand me when I say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as I had been. The narrowness, the deadly monotony of it, almost drove me mad. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) paused a minute, and added in a different tone: '' And then I met John Cavendish.'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You can imagine that, from my aunts' point of view, it was a very good match for me. But I can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed with me.
<p/>No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) was simply a way of escape from the insufferable monotony of my life. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said nothing, and after a moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went on: <div class="bookquote">``Don't misunderstand me. I was quite honest with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>). I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>), what was true, that I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) very much, that I hoped to come to like him (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) more, but that I was not in any way what the world calls `in love' with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) declared that that satisfied him (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>), and so--we were married.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) waited a long time, a little frown had gathered on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) forehead. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed to be looking back earnestly into those past days. <div class="bookquote">``I think--I am sure--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) cared for me at first. But I suppose we were not well matched. Almost at once, we drifted apart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>)--it is not a pleasing thing for my pride, but it is the truth-- tired of me very soon. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I must have made some murmur of dissent, for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went on quickly: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) did! Not that it matters now--now that we've come to the parting of the ways.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean? ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered quietly: <div class="bookquote">``I mean that I am not going to remain at Styles.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You and John are not going to live here?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``John may live here, but I shall not.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are going to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But why? ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) paused a long time, and said at last: <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps--because I want to be--free!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>And, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) spoke, I had a sudden vision of broad spaces, virgin tracts of forests, untrodden lands--and a realization of what freedom would mean to such a nature as Mary Cavendish. I seemed to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) for a moment as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) was, a proud wild creature, as untamed by civilization as some shy bird of the hills.
<p/>A little cry broke from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) lips: <div class="bookquote">``You don't know, you don't know, how this hateful place has been prison to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``but--but don't do anything rash.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, rash!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) voice mocked at my prudence. Then suddenly I said a thing I could have bitten out my tongue for: <div class="bookquote">``You know that Dr. Bauerstein has been arrested?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>An instant coldness passed like a mask over her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) face, blotting out all expression. '' John was so kind as to break that to me this morning.'' <div class="bookquote">``Well, what do you think? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked feebly. '' Of what?'' <div class="bookquote">``Of the arrest?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What should I think? Apparently he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is a German spy; so the gardener had told John.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) face and voice were absolutely cold and expressionless. Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) care, or did she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) not? She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) moved away a step or two, and fingered one of the flower vases. <div class="bookquote">``These are quite dead. I must do them again. Would you mind moving --thank you, Mr. Hastings.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) walked quietly past me out of the window, with a cool little nod of dismissal. No, surely she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) could not care for Bauerstein. No woman could act her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) part with that icy unconcern. Poirot did not make his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) appearance the following morning, and there was no sign of the Scotland Yard men. But, at lunch-time, there arrived a new piece of evidence--or rather lack of evidence. We had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter, which Mrs. Inglethorp had written on the evening preceding her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) death. Our efforts having been in vain, we had abandoned the matter, hoping that it might turn up of itself one day.
<p/>And this is just what did happen, in the shape of a communication, which arrived by the second post from a firm of French music publishers, acknowledging Mrs. Inglethorp's cheque, and regretting they had been unable to trace a certain series of Russian folksongs. So the last hope of solving the mystery, by means of Mrs. Inglethorp's correspondence on the fatal evening, had to be abandoned. Just before tea, I strolled down to tell Poirot of the new disappointment, but found, to my annoyance, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was once more out. '' Gone to London again?'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, monsieur, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) has but taken the train to Tadminster. ' To see a young lady's dispensary,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Silly ass! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I ejaculated. <div class="bookquote">``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) Wednesday was the one day she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wasn't there! Well, tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) to look us up to-morrow morning, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, monsieur. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>But, on the following day, no sign of Poirot. I was getting angry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was really treating us in the most cavalier fashion. After lunch, Lawrence drew me aside, and asked if I was going down to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>). '' No, I don't think I shall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) can come up here if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) wants to see us.'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lawrence/Monsieur Lawrence</b></font>)</div>Lawrence looked indeterminate. Something unusually nervous and excited in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) manner roused my curiosity. <div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">``I could go if there's anything special.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's nothing much, but-- well, if you are going, will you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>)--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) voice to a whisper--<div class="bookquote">``I think I've found the extra coffee-cup! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I had almost forgotten that enigmatical message of Poirot's, but now my curiosity was aroused afresh. Lawrence would say no more, so I decided that I would descend from my high horse, and once more seek out Poirot at Leastways Cottage.
<p/>This time I was received with a smile. Monsieur Poirot was within. Would I mount? I mounted accordingly. Poirot was sitting by the table, his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) head buried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) sprang up at my entrance. <div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked solicitously. <div class="bookquote">``You are not ill, I trust?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no, not ill. But I decide an affair of great moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whether to catch the criminal or not? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked facetiously. But, to my great surprise, Poirot nodded gravely. ''' To speak or not to speak,' as your so great Shakespeare says, `that is the question.' '' I did not trouble to correct the quotation. <div class="bookquote">``You are not serious, Poirot?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am of the most serious. For the most serious of all things hangs in the balance.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And that is?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A woman's happiness, mon ami ,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said gravely. I did not quite know what to say. <div class="bookquote">``The moment has come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot thoughtfully, <div class="bookquote">``and I do not know what to do. For, see you, it is a big stake for which I play. No one but I, Hercule Poirot, would attempt it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) tapped himself proudly on the breast. After pausing a few minutes respectfully, so as not to spoil his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) effect, I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) Lawrence's message. <div class="bookquote">``Aha!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) has found the extra coffee-cup. That is good. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) has more intelligence than would appear, this long-faced Monsieur Lawrence of yours! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I did not myself think very highly of Lawrence's intelligence; but I forebore to contradict Poirot, and gently took him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) to task for forgetting my instructions as to which were Cynthia's days off. <div class="bookquote">``It is true. I have the head of a sieve. However, the other young lady was most kind.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was sorry for my disappointment, and showed me everything in the kindest way.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, that's all right, then, and you must go to tea with Cynthia another day. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) about the letter. <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I always had hopes of that letter. But no, it was not to be. This affair must all be unravelled from within.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) tapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) forehead. '' These little grey cells. It is `up to them'--as you say over here.'' Then, suddenly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) asked: <div class="bookquote">``Are you a judge of finger-marks, my friend?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, rather surprised, <div class="bookquote">``I know that there are no two finger-marks alike, but that's as far as my science goes.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Exactly.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) unlocked a little drawer, and took out some photographs which he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) laid on the table. <div class="bookquote">``I have numbered them, 1, 2, 3. Will you describe them to me? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I studied the proofs attentively. <div class="bookquote">``All greatly magnified, I see. No. 1, I should say, are a man's finger-prints; thumb and first finger. No. 2 are a lady's; they are much smaller, and quite different in every way. No. 3'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--I paused for some time--<div class="bookquote">``there seem to be a lot of confused finger-marks, but here, very distinctly, are No. 1's.''

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You recognize them beyond fail?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes; they are identical.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot nodded, and gently taking the photographs from me locked them up again. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``that as usual, you are not going to explain?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary. No. 1 were the finger-prints of Monsieur Lawrence. No. 2 were those of Mademoiselle Cynthia. They are not important.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is, as you see, highly magnified.
<p/>You may have noticed a sort of blur extending all across the picture. I will not describe to you the special apparatus, dusting powder, etc., which I used.

Well, my friend, you have seen the finger-marks--it remains to tell you the particular object on which they had been left.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go on--I am really excited.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Eh bien!

''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed. '' But what were Lawrence Cavendish's finger-marks doing on it?

'' Long enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a very natural interest and curiosity. '' Our eyes met. Poirot's were pleasantly vague. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) got up and hummed a little tune. I watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) suspiciously. '' Poirot,'' I said, <div class="bookquote">``what was in this particular little bottle?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Poirot looked out of the window. ''
<p/>Hydro-chloride of strychnine,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said, over his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) shoulder, continuing to hum. '' Good heavens! '' I said it quite quietly. I was not surprised. I had expected that answer. <div class="bookquote">``They use the pure hydro-chloride of strychnine very little--only occasionally for pills. It is the official solution, Liq. Strychnine Hydro-clor. that is used in most medicines. That is why the finger-marks have remained undisturbed since then.''

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dropped my hat from the balcony,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>explained Poirot simply. <div class="bookquote">``Visitors were not permitted below at that hour, so, in spite of my many apologies, Mademoiselle Cynthia's colleague had to go down and fetch it for me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then you knew what you were going to find?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, not at all. I merely realized that it was possible, from your story, for Monsieur Lawrence to go to the poison cupboard.

No doubt it has struck you too.'' <div class="bookquote">``What is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, that there is altogether too much strychnine about this case. This is the third time we run up against it. There was strychnine in Mrs. Inglethorp's tonic. There is the strychnine sold across the counter at Styles St. Mary by Mace. Now we have more strychnine, handled by one of the household. It is confusing; and, as you know, I do not like confusion. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Before I could reply, one of the other Belgians opened the door and stuck his (<font color='blue'><b>Mace</b></font>) head in. <div class="bookquote">``There is a lady below, asking for Mr Hastings.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A lady? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I jumped up. Poirot followed me down the narrow stairs.

(<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will some day, if you ask me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>), smiling. '' That is well. If you should need a father confessor, madame''--she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) started ever so slightly--<div class="bookquote">``remember, Papa Poirot is always at your service.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) for a few minutes, as though seeking to read some deeper meaning into his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) words. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) turned abruptly away. '' Come, will you not walk back with us too, Monsieur Poirot?'' <div class="bookquote">``Enchanted, madame. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Cavendish</b></font>)</div>All the way to Styles, Mary talked fast and feverishly. It struck me that in some way she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was nervous of Poirot's eyes. The weather had broken, and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its shrewishness. Mary shivered a little, and buttoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) black sports coat closer. The wind through the trees made a mournful noise, like some great giant sighing. We walked up to the great door of Styles, and at once the knowledge came to us that something was wrong. Dorcas came running out to meet us. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) was crying and wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) hands. I was aware of other servants huddled together in the background, all eyes and ears. '' Oh, m`am! Oh, m`am! I don't know how to tell you--'' <div class="bookquote">``What is it, Dorcas? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked impatiently. '' Tell us at once.'' <div class="bookquote">``It's those wicked detectives. They've arrested him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)--they've arrested Mr. Cavendish!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Arrested Lawrence? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gasped. I saw a strange look come into Dorcas's eyes. '' No, sir. Not Mr. Lawrence--Mr. John.
<p/>'' Behind me, with a wild cry, Mary Cavendish fell heavily against me, and as I turned to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) I met the quiet triumph in Poirot's eyes. CHAPTER XI. THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION The trial of John Cavendish for the murder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) stepmother took place two months later. Of the intervening weeks I will say little, but my admiration and sympathy went out unfeignedly to Mary Cavendish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) ranged herself passionately on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) husband's side, scorning the mere idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) guilt, and fought for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) tooth and nail. I expressed my admiration to Poirot, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) nodded thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) is of those women who show at their best in adversity. It brings out all that is sweetest and truest in them. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) pride and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) jealousy have-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jealousy? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I queried. '' Yes. Have you not realized that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) is an unusually jealous woman? As I was saying, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) pride and jealousy have been laid aside. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) thinks of nothing but her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) husband, and the terrible fate that is hanging over him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).'' He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) spoke very feelingly, and I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) earnestly, remembering that last afternoon, when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been deliberating whether or not to speak. With his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) tenderness for <div class="bookquote">``a woman's happiness,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I felt glad that the decision had been taken out of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``Even now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``I can hardly believe it. You see, up to the very last minute, I thought it was Lawrence!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Poirot grinned. <div class="bookquote">``I know you did.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But John! My old friend John!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Every murderer is probably somebody's old friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>observed Poirot philosophically. <div class="bookquote">``You cannot mix up sentiment and reason.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I must say I think you might have given me a hint.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, mon ami , I did not do so, just because he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was your old friend. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was rather disconcerted by this, remembering how I had busily passed on to John what I believed to be Poirot's views concerning Bauerstein. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>), by the way, had been acquitted of the charge brought against him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>). Nevertheless, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) had been too clever for them this time, and the charge of espionage could not be brought home to him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) wings were pretty well clipped for the future. I asked Poirot whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) thought John would be condemned. To my intense surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) replied that, on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was extremely likely to be acquitted. '' But, Poirot--'' I protested. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my friend, have I not said to you all along that I have no proofs. It is one thing to know that a man is guilty, it is quite another matter to prove him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so. And, in this case, there is terribly little evidence. That is the whole trouble. I, Hercule Poirot, know, but I lack the last link in my chain. And unless I can find that missing link-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) head gravely. <div class="bookquote">``When did you first suspect John Cavendish? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, after a minute or two. <div class="bookquote">``Did you not suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) at all?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not after that fragment of conversation you overheard between Mrs. Cavendish and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) mother-in-law, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) subsequent lack of frankness at the inquest?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did you not put two and two together, and reflect that if it was not Alfred Inglethorp who was quarrelling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) wife--and you remember, he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) strenuously denied it at the inquest--it must be either Lawrence or John. Now, if it was Lawrence, Mary Cavendish's conduct was just as inexplicable.
<p/>But if, on the other hand, it was John, the whole thing was explained quite naturally.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, a light breaking in upon me, <div class="bookquote">``it was John who quarrelled with his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother that afternoon?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Exactly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And you have known this all along?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. Mrs. Cavendish's behaviour could only be explained that way.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And yet you say he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) may be acquitted? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) shoulders. '' Certainly I do. At the police court proceedings, we shall hear the case for the prosecution, but in all probability his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) solicitors will advise him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) to reserve his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) defence. That will be sprung upon us at the trial. And--ah, by the way, I have a word of caution to give you, my friend. I must not appear in the case.'' <div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. Officially, I have nothing to do with it. Until I have found that last link in my chain, I must remain behind the scenes. Mrs. Cavendish must think I am working for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) husband, not against him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I say, that's playing it a bit low down,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I protested. <div class="bookquote">``Not at all. We have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man, and we must use any means in our power--otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will slip through our fingers. That is why I have been careful to remain in the background. All the discoveries have been made by Japp, and Japp will take all the credit. If I am called upon to give evidence at all'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smiled broadly--<div class="bookquote">``it will probably be as a witness for the defence. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I could hardly believe my ears. <div class="bookquote">``It is quite en règle ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>continued Poirot. '' Strangely enough, I can give evidence that will demolish one contention of the prosecution.'' <div class="bookquote">``Which one?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The one that relates to the destruction of the will.
<p/>John Cavendish did not destroy that will. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot was a true prophet. I will not go into the details of the police court proceedings, as it involves many tiresome repetitions. I will merely state baldly that John Cavendish reserved his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) defence, and was duly committed for trial. September found us all in London. Mary took a house in Kensington, Poirot being included in the family party. I myself had been given a job at the War Office, so was able to see them continually. As the weeks went by, the state of Poirot's nerves grew worse and worse. That <div class="bookquote">``last link''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) talked about was still lacking. Privately, I hoped it might remain so, for what happiness could there be for Mary, if John were not acquitted? On September 15th John Cavendish appeared in the dock at the Old Bailey, charged with <div class="bookquote">``The Wilful Murder of Emily Agnes Inglethorp,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Old Bailey</b></font>)</div>and pleaded <div class="bookquote">``Not Guilty.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Old Bailey</b></font>)</div>Sir Ernest Heavywether, the famous K. C., had been engaged to defend him (<font color='blue'><b>Heavywether</b></font>). Mr. Philips, K. C., opened the case for the Crown. The murder, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philips</b></font>) said, was a most premeditated and cold-blooded one. It was neither more nor less than the deliberate poisoning of a fond and trusting woman by the stepson to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been more than a mother. Ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>stepson</b></font>) boyhood, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had supported him (<font color='blue'><b>stepson</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>stepson</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>stepson</b></font>) wife had lived at Styles Court in every luxury, surrounded by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) care and attention. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been their kind and generous benefactress. He (<font color='blue'><b>stepson</b></font>) proposed to call witnesses to show how the prisoner, a profligate and spendthrift, had been at the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) financial tether, and had also been carrying on an intrigue with a certain Mrs. Raikes, a neighbouring farmer's wife.
<p/>This having come to his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) stepmother's ears, she (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>) taxed him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) with it on the afternoon before her (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>) death, and a quarrel ensued, part of which was overheard. On the previous day, the prisoner had purchased strychnine at the village chemist's shop, wearing a disguise by means of which he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hoped to throw the onus of the crime upon another man--to wit, Mrs. Inglethorp's husband, of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been bitterly jealous. Luckily for Mr. Inglethorp, he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) had been able to produce an unimpeachable alibi. On the afternoon of July 17th, continued Counsel, immediately after the quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) son, Mrs. Inglethorp made a new will. This will was found destroyed in the grate of her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) bedroom the following morning, but evidence had come to light which showed that it had been drawn up in favour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) husband. Deceased had already made a will in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) favour before her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) marriage, but--and Mr. Philips wagged an expressive forefinger--the prisoner was not aware of that. What had induced the deceased to make a fresh will, with the old one still extant, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) could not say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) was an old lady, and might possibly have forgotten the former one; or--this seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) more likely --she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) may have had an idea that it was revoked by her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) marriage, as there had been some conversation on the subject. Ladies were not always very well versed in legal knowledge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) had, about a year before, executed a will in favour of the prisoner. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would call evidence to show that it was the prisoner who ultimately handed his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) stepmother her (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>) coffee on the fatal night.
<p/>Later in the evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had sought admission to her (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>) room, on which occasion, no doubt, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) found an opportunity of destroying the will which, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) knew, would render the one in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) favour valid. The prisoner had been arrested in consequence of the discovery, in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) room, by Detective Inspector Japp--a most brilliant officer--of the identical phial of strychnine which had been sold at the village chemist's to the supposed Mr. Inglethorp on the day before the murder. It would be for the jury to decide whether or not these damning facts constituted an overwhelming proof of the prisoner's guilt. And, subtly implying that a jury which did not so decide, was quite unthinkable, Mr. Philips sat down and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Philips</b></font>) forehead. The first witnesses for the prosecution were mostly those who had been called at the inquest, the medical evidence being again taken first. Sir Ernest Heavywether, who was famous all over England for the unscrupulous manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Heavywether</b></font>) bullied witnesses, only asked two questions. <div class="bookquote">``I take it, Dr. Bauerstein, that strychnine, as a drug, acts quickly?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And that you are unable to account for the delay in this case?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mace/Mace</b></font>)</div>Mr. Mace identified the phial handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mace</b></font>) by Counsel as that sold by him (<font color='blue'><b>Counsel</b></font>) to <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Inglethorp. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Pressed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) admitted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) only knew Mr. Inglethorp by sight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) had never spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>). The witness was not cross-examined. Alfred Inglethorp was called, and denied having purchased the poison. He (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) also denied having quarrelled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) wife. Various witnesses testified to the accuracy of these statements. The gardeners' evidence, as to the witnessing of the will was taken, and then Dorcas was called.
<p/>Dorcas, faithful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``young gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorcas faithful</b></font>)</div>denied strenuously that it could have been John's voice she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) heard, and resolutely declared, in the teeth of everything, that it was Mr. Inglethorp who had been in the boudoir with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) mistress. A rather wistful smile passed across the face of the prisoner in the dock. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) knew only too well how useless her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) gallant defiance was, since it was not the object of the defence to deny this point. Mrs. Cavendish, of course, could not be called upon to give evidence against her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) husband. After various questions on other matters, Mr. Philips asked: <div class="bookquote">``In the month of June last, do you remember a parcel arriving for Mr. Lawrence Cavendish from Parkson's?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Philips</b></font>)</div>Dorcas shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I don't remember, sir. It may have done, but Mr. Lawrence was away from home part of June.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``In the event of a parcel arriving for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) was away, what would be done with it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It would either be put in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) room or sent on after him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``By you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, I should leave it on the hall table. It would be Miss Howard who would attend to anything like that.''  (<font color='red'><b>Evelyn Howard/Evelyn</b></font>)</div>Evelyn Howard was called and, after being examined on other points, was questioned as to the parcel. '' Don't remember. Lots of parcels come. Can't remember one special one.'' <div class="bookquote">``You do not know if it was sent after Mr. Lawrence Cavendish to Wales, or whether it was put in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) room?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't think it was sent after him (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>). Should have remembered it if it was.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Supposing a parcel arrived addressed to Mr. Lawrence Cavendish, and afterwards it disappeared, should you remark its absence?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, don't think so. I should think someone had taken charge of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe, Miss Howard, that it was you who found this sheet of brown paper?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) held up the same dusty piece which Poirot and I had examined in the morning-room at Styles. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How did you come to look for it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Belgian detective who was employed on the case asked me to search for it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where did you eventually discover it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``On the top of--of--a wardrobe.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``On top of the prisoner's wardrobe?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I--I believe so.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did you not find it yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then you must know where you found it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it was on the prisoner's wardrobe.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is better.''  (<font color='red'><b>An assistant</b></font>)</div>An assistant from Parkson's, Theatrical Costumiers, testified that on June 29th, they had supplied a black beard to Mr. L. Cavendish, as requested. It was ordered by letter, and a postal order was enclosed. No, they had not kept the letter. All transactions were entered in their books. They had sent the beard, as directed, to <div class="bookquote">``L. Cavendish, Esq., Styles Court.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ernest/Ernest Heavywether/Heavywether</b></font>)</div>Sir Ernest Heavywether rose ponderously. <div class="bookquote">``Where was the letter written from?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``From Styles Court.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The same address to which you sent the parcel?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And the letter came from there?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ernest/Ernest Heavywether/Heavywether</b></font>)</div>Like a beast of prey, Heavywether fell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Heavywether</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``How do you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I--I don't understand.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How do you know that letter came from Styles? Did you notice the postmark?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No--but--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you did not notice the postmark!

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``In fact, the letter, though written on stamped notepaper, might have been posted from anywhere? From Wales, for instance? ''  (<font color='red'><b>The witness</b></font>)</div>The witness admitted that such might be the case, and Sir Ernest signified that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) was satisfied.
<p/>Elizabeth Wells, second housemaid at Styles, stated that after she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had gone to bed she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had bolted the front door, instead of leaving it on the latch as Mr. Inglethorp had requested. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had accordingly gone downstairs again to rectify her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) error. Hearing a slight noise in the West wing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had peeped along the passage, and had seen Mr. John Cavendish knocking at Mrs. Inglethorp's door. Sir Ernest Heavywether made short work of her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>), and under his (<font color='blue'><b>Heavywether</b></font>) unmerciful bullying she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) contradicted herself hopelessly, and Sir Ernest sat down again with a satisfied smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) face. With the evidence of Annie, as to the candle grease on the floor, and as to seeing the prisoner take the coffee into the boudoir, the proceedings were adjourned until the following day. As we went home, Mary Cavendish spoke bitterly against the prosecuting counsel. <div class="bookquote">``That hateful man! What a net he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has drawn around my poor John! How he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) twisted every little fact until he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) made it seem what it wasn't!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said consolingly, <div class="bookquote">``it will be the other way about to-morrow.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) said meditatively; then suddenly dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) voice. '' Mr. Hastings, you do not think--surely it could not have been Lawrence-- Oh, no, that could not be!'' But I myself was puzzled, and as soon as I was alone with Poirot I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) thought Sir Ernest was driving at. '' Ah!'' said Poirot appreciatively. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) is a clever man, that Sir Ernest.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) believes Lawrence guilty?''

It had been found in Mrs. Inglethorp's cheque book, and on being reversed at a mirror, showed clearly the words: ''... erything of which I die possessed I leave to my beloved husband Alfred Ing... '' This placed beyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour of the deceased lady's husband. Japp then produced the charred fragment of paper recovered from the grate, and this, with the discovery of the beard in the attic, completed his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) evidence.

Evidence as to his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) intrigue with Mrs. Raikes--poor Mary, that must have been bitter hearing for a woman of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pride. Evelyn Howard had been right in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) facts, though her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) animosity against Alfred Inglethorp had caused her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to jump to the conclusion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) was the person concerned. Lawrence Cavendish was then put into the box. In a low voice, in answer to Mr. Philips' questions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philips</b></font>) denied having ordered anything from Parkson's in June.
<p/>In fact, on June 29th, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philips</b></font>) had been staying away, in Wales. Instantly, Sir Ernest's chin was shooting pugnaciously forward. <div class="bookquote">``You deny having ordered a black beard from Parkson's on June 29th?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah! In the event of anything happening to your brother, who will inherit Styles Court?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lawrence/Monsieur Lawrence</b></font>)</div>The brutality of the question called a flush to Lawrence's pale face. The judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation, and the prisoner in the dock leant forward angrily. Heavywether cared nothing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Heavywether</b></font>) client's anger. '' Answer my question, if you please.'' <div class="bookquote">``I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lawrence/Monsieur Lawrence</b></font>)</div>said Lawrence quietly, <div class="bookquote">``that I should.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lawrence/Monsieur Lawrence</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by you `suppose'? Your brother has no children. You would inherit it, wouldn't you?''

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ernest/Ernest Heavywether/Heavywether</b></font>)</div>said Heavywether, with ferocious geniality. <div class="bookquote">``And you'd inherit a good slice of money too, wouldn't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Really, Sir Ernest,''  (<font color='red'><b>the judge</b></font>)</div>protested the judge, <div class="bookquote">``these questions are not relevant.''  (<font color='red'><b>the judge</b></font>)</div>Sir Ernest bowed, and having shot his (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) arrow proceeded.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I put it to you that you did do so?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ernest/Ernest Heavywether/Heavywether</b></font>)</div>Sir Ernest fairly shot the next question at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>).

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The bullying manner was highly efficacious with a nervous disposition. <div class="bookquote">``I--I suppose I must have taken up the bottle.''

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then why did you take it up?''

(<font color='red'><b>Lawrence/Monsieur Lawrence</b></font>)</div>Lawrence stammered pitiably. <div class="bookquote">``I--I--''  (<font color='red'><b>Ernest/Ernest Heavywether/Heavywether</b></font>)</div>With a satisfied and expressive countenance, Sir Ernest observed: <div class="bookquote">``I have nothing more to ask you, Mr. Cavendish.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ernest/Ernest Heavywether/Heavywether</b></font>)</div>This bit of cross-examination had caused great excitement in court. The heads of the many fashionably attired women present were busily laid together, and their whispers became so loud that the judge angrily threatened to have the court cleared if there was not immediate silence. There was little more evidence. The hand-writing experts were called upon for their opinion of the signature of <div class="bookquote">``Alfred Inglethorp''  (<font color='red'><b>The experts</b></font>)</div>in the chemist's poison register. They all declared unanimously that it was certainly not his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) hand-writing, and gave it as their view that it might be that of the prisoner disguised. Cross-examined, they admitted that it might be the prisoner's hand-writing cleverly counterfeited. Sir Ernest Heavywether's speech in opening the case for the defence was not a long one, but it was backed by the full force of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heavywether</b></font>) emphatic manner.
<p/>Never, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heavywether</b></font>) said, in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heavywether</b></font>) long experience, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Heavywether</b></font>) known a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence. Not only was it entirely circumstantial, but the greater part of it was practically unproved. Let them take the testimony they had heard and sift it impartially. The strychnine had been found in a drawer in the prisoner's room. That drawer was an unlocked one, as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had pointed out, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) submitted that there was no evidence to prove that it was the prisoner who had concealed the poison there. It was, in fact, a wicked and malicious attempt on the part of some third person to fix the crime on the prisoner. The prosecution had been unable to produce a shred of evidence in support of their contention that it was the prisoner who ordered the black beard from Parkson's. The quarrel which had taken place between prisoner and his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) stepmother was freely admitted, but both it and his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) financial embarrassments had been grossly exaggerated. His (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) learned friend--Sir Ernest nodded carelessly at Mr. Philips--had stated that if the prisoner were an innocent man, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would have come forward at the inquest to explain that it was he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), and not Mr. Inglethorp, who had been the participator in the quarrel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) thought the facts had been misrepresented. What had actually occurred was this. The prisoner, returning to the house on Tuesday evening, had been authoritatively told that there had been a violent quarrel between Mr. and Mrs. Inglethorp. No suspicion had entered the prisoner's head that anyone could possibly have mistaken his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) voice for that of Mr. Inglethorp. He (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) naturally concluded that his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) stepmother had had two quarrels.
<p/>The prosecution averred that on Monday, July 16th, the prisoner had entered the chemist's shop in the village, disguised as Mr. Inglethorp. The prisoner, on the contrary, was at that time at a lonely spot called Marston's Spinney, where he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had been summoned by an anonymous note, couched in blackmailing terms, and threatening to reveal certain matters to his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) wife unless he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) complied with its demands. The prisoner had, accordingly, gone to the appointed spot, and after waiting there vainly for half an hour had returned home. Unfortunately, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had met with no one on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) story, but luckily he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had kept the note, and it would be produced as evidence. As for the statement relating to the destruction of the will, the prisoner had formerly practiced at the Bar, and was perfectly well aware that the will made in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) favour a year before was automatically revoked by his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) stepmother's remarriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would call evidence to show who did destroy the will, and it was possible that that might open up quite a new view of the case. Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would point out to the jury that there was evidence against other people besides John Cavendish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) would direct their attention to the fact that the evidence against Mr. Lawrence Cavendish was quite as strong, if not stronger than that against his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) would now call the prisoner. John acquitted himself well in the witness-box. Under Sir Ernest's skilful handling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) tale credibly and well. The anonymous note received by him (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) was produced, and handed to the jury to examine. The readiness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) admitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) financial difficulties, and the disagreement with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) stepmother, lent value to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) denials.
<p/>At the close of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) examination, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) paused, and said: <div class="bookquote">``I should like to make one thing clear. I utterly reject and disapprove of Sir Ernest Heavywether's insinuations against my brother. My brother, I am convinced, had no more to do with the crime than I have.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Sir Ernest merely smiled, and noted with a sharp eye that John's protest had produced a very favourable impression on the jury. Then the cross-examination began. <div class="bookquote">``I understand you to say that it never entered your head that the witnesses at the inquest could possibly have mistaken your voice for that of Mr. Inglethorp. Is not that very surprising?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't think so. I was told there had been a quarrel between my mother and Mr. Inglethorp, and it never occurred to me that such was not really the case.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not when the servant Dorcas repeated certain fragments of the conversation--fragments which you must have recognized?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I did not recognize them.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your memory must be unusually short!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' No, but we were both angry, and, I think, said more than we meant. I paid very little attention to my mother's actual words.'' Mr. Philips' incredulous sniff was a triumph of forensic skill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philips</b></font>) passed on to the subject of the note. <div class="bookquote">``You have produced this note very opportunely. Tell me, is there nothing familiar about the hand-writing of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not that I know of.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your own hand-writing--carelessly disguised?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I do not think so.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I put it to you that it is your own hand-writing!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I put it to you that, anxious to prove an alibi, you conceived the idea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment, and wrote this note yourself in order to bear out your statement!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it not a fact that, at the time you claim to have been waiting about at a solitary and unfrequented spot, you were really in the chemist's shop in Styles St. Mary, where you purchased strychnine in the name of Alfred Inglethorp?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No, that is a lie.'' <div class="bookquote">``I put it to you that, wearing a suit of Mr. Inglethorp's clothes, with a black beard trimmed to resemble his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>), you were there--and signed the register in his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) name!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is absolutely untrue.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then I will leave the remarkable similarity of hand-writing between the note, the register, and your own, to the consideration of the jury,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Philips</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Philips, and sat down with the air of a man who has done his (<font color='blue'><b>Philips</b></font>) duty, but who was nevertheless horrified by such deliberate perjury. After this, as it was growing late, the case was adjourned till Monday. Poirot, I noticed, was looking profoundly discouraged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) had that little frown between the eyes that I knew so well. '' What is it, Poirot? '' I inquired. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, mon ami , things are going badly, badly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>In spite of myself, my heart gave a leap of relief. Evidently there was a likelihood of John Cavendish being acquitted. When we reached the house, my little friend waved aside Mary's offer of tea. '' No, I thank you, madame. I will mount to my room. '' I followed him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). Still frowning, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) went across to the desk and took out a small pack of patience cards. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) drew up a chair to the table, and, to my utter amazement, began solemnly to build card houses! My jaw dropped involuntarily, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said at once: <div class="bookquote">``No, mon ami , I am not in my second childhood! I steady my nerves, that is all.
<p/>This employment requires precision of the fingers. With precision of the fingers goes precision of the brain. And never have I needed that more than now!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What is the trouble? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. With a great thump on the table, Poirot demolished his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) carefully built up edifice. <div class="bookquote">``It is this, mon ami! That I can build card houses seven stories high, but I cannot'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--thump--<div class="bookquote">``find'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--thump--<div class="bookquote">``that last link of which I spoke to you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could not quite tell what to say, so I held my peace, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) began slowly building up the cards again, speaking in jerks as he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) did so. <div class="bookquote">``It is done--so! By placing--one card--on another--with mathematical--precision! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I watched the card house rising under his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) hands, story by story. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) never hesitated or faltered. It was really almost like a conjuring trick. <div class="bookquote">``What a steady hand you've got,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked. <div class="bookquote">``I believe I've only seen your hand shake once.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``On an occasion when I was enraged, without doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>observed Poirot, with great placidity. '' Yes indeed! You were in a towering rage. Do you remember? It was when you discovered that the lock of the despatch-case in Mrs. Inglethorp's bedroom had been forced. You stood by the mantel-piece, twiddling the things on it in your usual fashion, and your hand shook like a leaf! I must say--'' But I stopped suddenly. For Poirot, uttering a hoarse and inarticulate cry, again annihilated his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) masterpiece of cards, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) hands over his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) eyes swayed backwards and forwards, apparently suffering the keenest agony. '' Good heavens, Poirot! '' I cried. <div class="bookquote">``What is the matter? Are you taken ill?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) gasped. <div class="bookquote">``It is--it is--that I have an idea!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed, much relieved. <div class="bookquote">``One of your `little ideas'?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, ma foi , no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>replied Poirot frankly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This time it is an idea gigantic! Stupendous! And you-- you , my friend, have given it to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Suddenly clasping me in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) arms, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) kissed me warmly on both cheeks, and before I had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room. Mary Cavendish entered at that moment. <div class="bookquote">``What is the matter with Monsieur Poirot? He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) rushed past me crying out: 'A garage! For the love of Heaven, direct me to a garage, madame!' And, before I could answer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) had dashed out into the street. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hurried to the window. True enough, there he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was, tearing down the street, hatless, and gesticulating as he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) went. I turned to Mary with a gesture of despair. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>)'ll be stopped by a policeman in another minute. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) goes, round the corner! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Our eyes met, and we stared helplessly at one another. <div class="bookquote">``What can be the matter? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shook my head. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) was building card houses, when suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) had an idea, and rushed off as you saw.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Cavendish</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``I expect he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) will be back before dinner. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Cavendish</b></font>)</div>But night fell, and Poirot had not returned. CHAPTER XII. THE LAST LINK POIROT'S abrupt departure had intrigued us all greatly. Sunday morning wore away, and still he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) did not reappear. But about three o'clock a ferocious and prolonged hooting outside drove us to the window, to see Poirot alighting from a car, accompanied by Japp and Summerhaye. The little man was transformed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) radiated an absurd complacency. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) bowed with exaggerated respect to Mary Cavendish. '' Madame, I have your permission to hold a little réunion in the salon ? It is necessary for every one to attend. '' Mary smiled sadly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, Monsieur Poirot, that you have carte blanche in every way.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are too amiable, madame.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Still beaming, Poirot marshalled us all into the drawing-room, bringing forward chairs as he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) did so. '' Miss Howard--here. Mademoiselle Cynthia. Monsieur Lawrence. The good Dorcas. And Annie. Bien! We must delay our proceedings a few minutes until Mr. Inglethorp arrives. I have sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) a note. '' Miss Howard rose immediately from her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) seat. <div class="bookquote">``If that man comes into the house, I leave it!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) and pleaded in a low voice. Finally Miss Howard consented to return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) chair. A few minutes later Alfred Inglethorp entered the room. The company once assembled, Poirot rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) seat with the air of a popular lecturer, and bowed politely to his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) audience. '' Messieurs, mesdames , as you all know, I was called in by Monsieur John Cavendish to investigate this case. I at once examined the bedroom of the deceased which, by the advice of the doctors, had been kept locked, and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy occurred. I found: first, a fragment of green material; second, a stain on the carpet near the window, still damp; thirdly, an empty box of bromide powders. <div class="bookquote">``To take the fragment of green material first, I found it caught in the bolt of the communicating door between that room and the adjoining one occupied by Mademoiselle Cynthia. I handed the fragment over to the police who did not consider it of much importance. Nor did they recognize it for what it was--a piece torn from a green land armlet. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a little stir of excitement. <div class="bookquote">``Now there was only one person at Styles who worked on the land--Mrs. Cavendish.
<p/>Therefore it must have been Mrs. Cavendish who entered the deceased's room through the door communicating with Mademoiselle Cynthia's room.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But that door was bolted on the inside!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried. <div class="bookquote">``When I examined the room, yes. But in the first place we have only her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) word for it, since it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) who tried that particular door and reported it fastened. In the ensuing confusion she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would have had ample opportunity to shoot the bolt across. I took an early opportunity of verifying my conjectures. To begin with, the fragment corresponds exactly with a tear in Mrs. Cavendish's armlet. Also, at the inquest, Mrs. Cavendish declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) had heard, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) own room, the fall of the table by the bed. I took an early opportunity of testing that statement by stationing my friend Monsieur Hastings in the left wing of the building, just outside Mrs. Cavendish's door. I myself, in company with the police, went to the deceased's room, and whilst there I, apparently accidentally, knocked over the table in question, but found that, as I had expected, Monsieur Hastings had heard no sound at all. This confirmed my belief that Mrs. Cavendish was not speaking the truth when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) had been dressing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) room at the time of the tragedy. In fact, I was convinced that, far from having been in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) own room, Mrs. Cavendish was actually in the deceased's room when the alarm was given. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shot a quick glance at Mary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was very pale, but smiling. <div class="bookquote">``I proceeded to reason on that assumption. Mrs. Cavendish is in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) mother-in-law's room. We will say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) is seeking for something and has not yet found it. Suddenly Mrs. Inglethorp awakens and is seized with an alarming paroxysm.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) flings out her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) arm, overturning the bed table, and then pulls desperately at the bell. Mrs. Cavendish, startled, drops her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) candle, scattering the grease on the carpet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) picks it up, and retreats quickly to Mademoiselle Cynthia's room, closing the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hurries out into the passage, for the servants must not find her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is. But it is too late! Already footsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings. What can she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) do? Quick as thought, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hurries back to the young girl's room, and starts shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) awake. The hastily aroused household come trooping down the passage. They are all busily battering at Mrs. Inglethorp's door. It occurs to nobody that Mrs. Cavendish has not arrived with the rest, but--and this is significant--I can find no one who saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) come from the other wing.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) looked at Mary Cavendish. '' Am I right, madame?'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) head. '' Quite right, monsieur. You understand that, if I had thought I would do my husband any good by revealing these facts, I would have done so. But it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) guilt or innocence.'' <div class="bookquote">``In a sense, that is correct, madame. But it cleared my mind of many misconceptions, and left me free to see other facts in their true significance.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The will!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lawrence/Monsieur Lawrence</b></font>)</div>cried Lawrence. '' Then it was you, Mary, who destroyed the will? '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head, and Poirot shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) also. '' No,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said quietly. <div class="bookquote">``There is only one person who could possibly have destroyed that will-- Mrs. Inglethorp herself!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Impossible!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) had only made it out that very afternoon!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nevertheless, mon ami , it was Mrs. Inglethorp.
<p/>Because, in no other way can you account for the fact that, on one of the hottest days of the year, Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire to be lighted in her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) room. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gave a gasp. What idiots we had been never to think of that fire as being incongruous! Poirot was continuing: <div class="bookquote">``The temperature on that day, messieurs, was 80 degrees in the shade. Yet Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire! Why? Because she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) wished to destroy something, and could think of no other way. You will remember that, in consequence of the War economics practiced at Styles, no waste paper was thrown away. There was therefore no means of destroying a thick document such as a will. The moment I heard of a fire being lighted in Mrs. Inglethorp's room, I leaped to the conclusion that it was to destroy some important document--possibly a will. So the discovery of the charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me. I did not, of course, know at the time that the will in question had only been made this afternoon, and I will admit that, when I learnt that fact, I fell into a grievous error. I came to the conclusion that Mrs. Inglethorp's determination to destroy her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) will arose as a direct consequence of the quarrel she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) had that afternoon, and that therefore the quarrel took place after, and not before the making of the will. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Here, as we know, I was wrong, and I was forced to abandon that idea. I faced the problem from a new standpoint. Now, at 4 o'clock, Dorcas overheard her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) mistress saying angrily: `You need not think that any fear of publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.
<p/>'' I conjectured, and conjectured rightly, that these words were addressed, not to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, but to Mr. John Cavendish. At 5 o'clock, an hour later, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) uses almost the same words, but the standpoint is different. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) admits to Dorcas, 'I don't know what to do; scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing.' At 4 o'clock she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has been angry, but completely mistress of herself. At 5 o'clock she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is in violent distress, and speaks of having had a great shock. '' Looking at the matter psychologically, I drew one deduction which I was convinced was correct. The second `scandal' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) spoke of was not the same as the first--and it concerned herself! '' Let us reconstruct. At 4 o'clock, Mrs. Inglethorp quarrels with her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) son, and threatens to denounce him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wife--who, by the way, overheard the greater part of the conversation. At 4.30, Mrs. Inglethorp, in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills, makes a will in favour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) husband, which the two gardeners witness. At 5 o'clock, Dorcas finds her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) mistress in a state of considerable agitation, with a slip of paper--'a letter,' Dorcas thinks--in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) hand, and it is then that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) orders the fire in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) room to be lighted. Presumably, then, between 4.30 and 5 o'clock, something has occurred to occasion a complete revolution of feeling, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) is now as anxious to destroy the will, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) was before to make it. What was that something? '' As far as we know, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) was quite alone during that half-hour. Nobody entered or left that boudoir. What then occasioned this sudden change of sentiment? <div class="bookquote">``One can only guess, but I believe my guess to be correct. Mrs. Inglethorp had no stamps in her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) desk.
<p/>We know this, because later she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) asked Dorcas to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) some. Now in the opposite corner of the room stood her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) husband's desk--locked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) was anxious to find some stamps, and, according to my theory, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) tried her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) own keys in the desk. That one of them fitted I know. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) therefore opened the desk, and in searching for the stamps she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) came across something else--that slip of paper which Dorcas saw in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) hand, and which assuredly was never meant for Mrs. Inglethorp's eyes. On the other hand, Mrs. Cavendish believed that the slip of paper to which her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) mother-in-law clung so tenaciously was a written proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) own husband's infidelity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) demanded it from Mrs. Inglethorp who assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>), quite truly, that it had nothing to do with that matter. Mrs. Cavendish did not believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) thought that Mrs. Inglethorp was shielding her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) stepson. Now Mrs. Cavendish is a very resolute woman, and, behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) mask of reserve, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) was madly jealous of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) determined to get hold of that paper at all costs, and in this resolution chance came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) aid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) happened to pick up the key of Mrs. Inglethorp's despatch-case, which had been lost that morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) mother-in-law invariably kept all important papers in this particular case. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Cavendish, therefore, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) plans as only a woman driven desperate through jealousy could have done. Some time in the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) unbolted the door leading into Mademoiselle Cynthia's room. Possibly she (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) applied oil to the hinges, for I found that it opened quite noiselessly when I tried it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) put off her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) project until the early hours of the morning as being safer, since the servants were accustomed to hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) move about her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) room at that time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) dressed completely in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) land kit, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) way quietly through Mademoiselle Cynthia's room into that of Mrs. Inglethorp.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) paused a moment, and Cynthia interrupted: <div class="bookquote">``But I should have woken up if anyone had come through my room?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not if you were drugged, mademoiselle.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Drugged?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Mais, oui! '' '' You remember''--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) addressed us collectively again--``that through all the tumult and noise next door Mademoiselle Cynthia slept. That admitted of two possibilities. Either her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sleep was feigned--which I did not believe--or her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) unconsciousness was indeed by artificial means. <div class="bookquote">``With this latter idea in my mind, I examined all the coffee-cups most carefully, remembering that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had brought Mademoiselle Cynthia her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) coffee the night before. I took a sample from each cup, and had them analysed--with no result. I had counted the cups carefully, in the event of one having been removed. Six persons had taken coffee, and six cups were duly found. I had to confess myself mistaken. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Then I discovered that I had been guilty of a very grave oversight. Coffee had been brought in for seven persons, not six, for Dr. Bauerstein had been there that evening. This changed the face of the whole affair, for there was now one cup missing. The servants noticed nothing, since Annie, the housemaid, who took in the coffee, brought in seven cups, not knowing that Mr. Inglethorp never drank it, whereas Dorcas, who cleared them away the following morning, found six as usual--or strictly speaking she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) found five, the sixth being the one found broken in Mrs. Inglethorp's room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was confident that the missing cup was that of Mademoiselle Cynthia. I had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the cups found contained sugar, which Mademoiselle Cynthia never took in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) coffee. My attention was attracted by the story of Annie about some `salt' on the tray of cocoa which she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) took every night to Mrs. Inglethorp's room. I accordingly secured a sample of that cocoa, and sent it to be analysed.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But that had already been done by Dr. Bauerstein,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lawrence/Monsieur Lawrence</b></font>)</div>said Lawrence quickly. '' Not exactly. The analyst was asked by him (<font color='blue'><b>analyst</b></font>) to report whether strychnine was, or was not, present. He (<font color='blue'><b>analyst</b></font>) did not have it tested, as I did, for a narcotic.'' <div class="bookquote">``For a narcotic?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. Here is the analyst's report. Mrs. Cavendish administered a safe, but effectual, narcotic to both Mrs. Inglethorp and Mademoiselle Cynthia. And it is possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had a mauvais quart d'heure in consequence! Imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) feelings when her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother-in-law is suddenly taken ill and dies, and immediately after she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hears the word `Poison'! She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) has believed that the sleeping draught she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) administered was perfectly harmless, but there is no doubt that for one terrible moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) must have feared that Mrs. Inglethorp's death lay at her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) is seized with panic, and under its influence she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) hurries downstairs, and quickly drops the coffee-cup and saucer used by Mademoiselle Cynthia into a large brass vase, where it is discovered later by Monsieur Lawrence. The remains of the cocoa she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) dare not touch. Too many eyes are upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). Guess at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) relief when strychnine is mentioned, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) discovers that after all the tragedy is not her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) doing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are now able to account for the symptoms of strychnine poisoning being so long in making their appearance. A narcotic taken with strychnine will delay the action of the poison for some hours.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot paused. Mary looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>), the colour slowly rising in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``All you have said is quite true, Monsieur Poirot. It was the most awful hour of my life. I shall never forget it. But you are wonderful. I understand now--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What I meant when I told you that you could safely confess to Papa Poirot, eh? But you would not trust me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I see everything now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lawrence/Monsieur Lawrence</b></font>)</div>said Lawrence. '' The drugged cocoa, taken on top of the poisoned coffee, amply accounts for the delay.'' '' Exactly. But was the coffee poisoned, or was it not? We come to a little difficulty here, since Mrs. Inglethorp never drank it.'' <div class="bookquote">``What? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The cry of surprise was universal. '' No. You will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in Mrs. Inglethorp's room? There were some peculiar points about that stain. It was still damp, it exhaled a strong odour of coffee, and imbedded in the nap of the carpet I found some little splinters of china. What had happened was plain to me, for not two minutes before I had placed my little case on the table near the window, and the table, tilting up, had deposited it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot. In exactly the same way, Mrs. Inglethorp had laid down her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) cup of coffee on reaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) room the night before, and the treacherous table had played her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) the same trick.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What happened next is mere guess work on my part, but I should say that Mrs. Inglethorp picked up the broken cup and placed it on the table by the bed. Feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) heated up her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) cocoa, and drank it off then and there. Now we are faced with a new problem. We know the cocoa contained no strychnine. The coffee was never drunk. Yet the strychnine must have been administered between seven and nine o'clock that evening. What third medium was there--a medium so suitable for disguising the taste of strychnine that it is extraordinary no one has thought of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot looked round the room, and then answered himself impressively. '' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) medicine!'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that the murderer introduced the strychnine into her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) tonic? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried. <div class="bookquote">``There was no need to introduce it. It was already there--in the mixture. The strychnine that killed Mrs. Inglethorp was the identical strychnine prescribed by Dr. Wilkins. To make that clear to you, I will read you an extract from a book on dispensing which I found in the Dispensary of the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster: '' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>`The following prescription has become famous in text books: Strychninae Sulph... . gr. I Potass Bromide ... 3vi Aqua ad... 3viii Fiat Mistura This solution deposits in a few hours the greater part of the strychnine salt as an insoluble bromide in transparent crystals. A lady in England lost her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) life by taking a similar mixture: the precipitated strychnine collected at the bottom, and in taking the last dose she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) swallowed nearly all of it!''
<p/>``Now there was, of course, no bromide in Dr. Wilkins' prescription, but you will remember that I mentioned an empty box of bromide powders. One or two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine would effectually precipitate the strychnine, as the book describes, and cause it to be taken in the last dose. You will learn later that the person who usually poured out Mrs. Inglethorp's medicine was always extremely careful not to shake the bottle, but to leave the sediment at the bottom of it undisturbed. <div class="bookquote">``Throughout the case, there have been evidences that the tragedy was intended to take place on Monday evening. On that day, Mrs. Inglethorp's bell wire was neatly cut, and on Monday evening Mademoiselle Cynthia was spending the night with friends, so that Mrs. Inglethorp would have been quite alone in the right wing, completely shut off from help of any kind, and would have died, in all probability, before medical aid could have been summoned. But in her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) hurry to be in time for the village entertainment Mrs. Inglethorp forgot to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) medicine, and the next day she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) lunched away from home, so that the last--and fatal--dose was actually taken twenty-four hours later than had been anticipated by the murderer; and it is owing to that delay that the final proof--the last link of the chain--is now in my hands.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Amid breathless excitement, he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) held out three thin strips of paper. '' A letter in the murderer's own hand-writing, mes amis! Had it been a little clearer in its terms, it is possible that Mrs. Inglethorp, warned in time, would have escaped. As it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) realized her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) danger, but not the manner of it.''
<p/>In the deathly silence, Poirot pieced together the slips of paper and, clearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) throat, read: ''' Dearest Evelyn: '' ' You will be anxious at hearing nothing. It is all right-- only it will be to-night instead of last night. You understand. There's a good time coming once the old woman is dead and out of the way. No one can possibly bring home the crime to me. That idea of yours about the bromides was a stroke of genius! But we must be very circumspect. A false step--' '' Here, my friends, the letter breaks off. Doubtless the writer was interrupted; but there can be no question as to his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) identity. We all know this hand-writing and--'' A howl that was almost a scream broke the silence. '' You devil! How did you get it? '' A chair was overturned. Poirot skipped nimbly aside. A quick movement on his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) part, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) assailant fell with a crash. '' Messieurs, mesdames ,'' said Poirot, with a flourish, <div class="bookquote">``let me introduce you to the murderer, Mr. Alfred Inglethorp!''

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, my friend, as I say, my views as to Mr. Inglethorp's guilt were very much shaken. There was, in fact, so much evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) that I was inclined to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) had not done it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``When did you change your mind?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' When I found that the more efforts I made to clear him (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>), the more efforts he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) made to get himself arrested. Then, when I discovered that Inglethorp had nothing to do with Mrs. Raikes and that in fact it was John Cavendish who was interested in that quarter, I was quite sure.'' <div class="bookquote">``But why?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Simply this. If it had been Inglethorp who was carrying on an intrigue with Mrs. Raikes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) silence was perfectly comprehensible. But, when I discovered that it was known all over the village that it was John who was attracted by the farmer's pretty wife, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) silence bore quite a different interpretation. It was nonsense to pretend that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was afraid of the scandal, as no possible scandal could attach to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). This attitude of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) gave me furiously to think, and I was slowly forced to the conclusion that Alfred Inglethorp wanted to be arrested. Eh bien!
<p/>from that moment, I was equally determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) should not be arrested.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute. I don't see why he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) wished to be arrested?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because, mon ami , it is the law of your country that a man once acquitted can never be tried again for the same offence. Aha! but it was clever--his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) idea! Assuredly, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a man of method. See here, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was bound to be suspected, so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conceived the exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence against himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wished to be arrested. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would then produce his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) irreproachable alibi--and, hey presto, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was safe for life!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I still don't see how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) managed to prove his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) alibi, and yet go to the chemist's shop?''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot stared at me in surprise. <div class="bookquote">``Is it possible? My poor friend!

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But, certainly. Who else? It was most easy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) is of a good height, her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) voice is deep and manly; moreover, remember, she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) and Inglethorp are cousins, and there is a distinct resemblance between them, especially in their gait and bearing. It was simplicity itself. They are a clever pair!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was done,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked. '' Bon! I will reconstruct for you as far as possible. I am inclined to think that Miss Howard was the master mind in that affair. You remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) once mentioning that her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) father was a doctor? Possibly she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) dispensed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) medicines for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), or she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) may have taken the idea from one of the many books lying about when Mademoiselle Cynthia was studying for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) exam.
<p/>Anyway, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was familiar with the fact that the addition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause the precipitation of the latter. Probably the idea came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) quite suddenly. Mrs. Inglethorp had a box of bromide powders, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) occasionally took at night. What could be easier than quietly to dissolve one or more of those powders in Mrs. Inglethorp's large sized bottle of medicine when it came from Coot's? The risk is practically nil. The tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later. If anyone has seen either of them touching the medicine, they will have forgotten it by that time. Miss Howard will have engineered her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) quarrel, and departed from the house. The lapse of time, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) absence, will defeat all suspicion. Yes, it was a clever idea! If they had left it alone, it is possible the crime might never have been brought home to them. But they were not satisfied. They tried to be too clever--and that was their undoing.'' Poirot puffed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) tiny cigarette, his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) eyes fixed on the ceiling. ``They arranged a plan to throw suspicion on John Cavendish, by buying strychnine at the village chemist's, and signing the register in his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) hand-writing. <div class="bookquote">``On Monday Mrs. Inglethorp will take the last dose of her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) medicine. On Monday, therefore, at six o'clock, Alfred Inglethorp arranges to be seen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village. Miss Howard has previously made up a cock and bull story about him (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) and Mrs. Raikes to account for his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) tongue afterwards.
<p/>At six o'clock, Miss Howard, disguised as Alfred Inglethorp, enters the chemist's shop, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) story about a dog, obtains the strychnine, and writes the name of Alfred Inglethorp in John's handwriting, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) had previously studied carefully. ''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Cavendish/Mr. Cavendish</b></font>)</div>But, as it will never do if John, too, can prove an alibi, she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) writes him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) an anonymous note--still copying his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hand-writing--which takes him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to a remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). '' So far, all goes well. Miss Howard goes back to Middlingham. Alfred Inglethorp returns to Styles. There is nothing that can compromise him (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) in any way, since it is Miss Howard who has the strychnine, which, after all, is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on John Cavendish. '' But now a hitch occurs. Mrs. Inglethorp does not take her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) medicine that night. The broken bell, Cynthia's absence--arranged by Inglethorp through his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) wife--all these are wasted. And then--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) slip. '' Mrs. Inglethorp is out, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) sits down to write to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) accomplice, who, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) fears, may be in a panic at the nonsuccess of their plan. It is probable that Mrs. Inglethorp returned earlier than he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) expected. Caught in the act, and somewhat flurried he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) hastily shuts and locks his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) desk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) fears that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) remains in the room he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) may have to open it again, and that Mrs. Inglethorp might catch sight of the letter before he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) could snatch it up. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) goes out and walks in the woods, little dreaming that Mrs. Inglethorp will open his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) desk, and discover the incriminating document. '' But this, as we know, is what happened.
<p/>Mrs. Inglethorp reads it, and becomes aware of the perfidy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) husband and Evelyn Howard, though, unfortunately, the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) knows that she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) is in danger--but is ignorant of where the danger lies. She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) decides to say nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) husband, but sits down and writes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) solicitor, asking him (<font color='blue'><b>solicitor</b></font>) to come on the morrow, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) also determines to destroy immediately the will which she (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) has just made. She (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) keeps the fatal letter.'' <div class="bookquote">``It was to discover that letter, then, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) husband forced the lock of the despatch-case?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and from the enormous risk he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ran we can see how fully he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) realized its importance.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There's only one thing I can't make out, why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) destroy it at once when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) got hold of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not dare take the biggest risk of all--that of keeping it on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own person.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Look at it from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) point of view. I have discovered that there were only five short minutes in which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could have taken it--the five minutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene, for before that time Annie was brushing the stairs, and would have seen anyone who passed going to the right wing. Figure to yourself the scene! He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) enters the room, unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeys--they were all much alike. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hurries to the despatch-case--it is locked, and the keys are nowhere to be seen. That is a terrible blow to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), for it means that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) presence in the room cannot be concealed as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had hoped.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sees clearly that everything must be risked for the sake of that damning piece of evidence. Quickly, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) forces the lock with a penknife, and turns over the papers until he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) finds what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is looking for. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But now a fresh dilemma arises: he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dare not keep that piece of paper on him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) may be seen leaving the room--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) may be searched. If the paper is found on him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), it is certain doom. Probably, at this minute, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hears the sounds below of Mr. Wells and John leaving the boudoir. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) must act quickly. Where can he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hide this terrible slip of paper? The contents of the waste-paper-basket are kept and in any case, are sure to be examined. There are no means of destroying it; and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) dare not keep it. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) looks round, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sees--what do you think, mon ami? '' I shook my head. '' In a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) has torn the letter into long thin strips, and rolling them up into spills he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other spills in the vase on the mantle-piece. '' I uttered an exclamation. <div class="bookquote">``No one would think of looking there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>Poirot continued. '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) will be able, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) leisure, to come back and destroy this solitary piece of evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``Then, all the time, it was in the spill vase in Mrs. Inglethorp's bedroom, under our very noses?

That is where I discovered my `last link,' and I owe that very fortunate discovery to you.'' <div class="bookquote">``To me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. Do you remember telling me that my hand shook as I was straightening the ornaments on the mantel-piece?'' '' Yes, but I don't see--'' <div class="bookquote">``No, but I saw.
<p/>Do you know, my friend, I remembered that earlier in the morning, when we had been there together, I had straightened all the objects on the mantel-piece. And, if they were already straightened, there would be no need to straighten them again, unless, in the meantime, someone else had touched them.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dear me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I murmured, <div class="bookquote">``so that is the explanation of your extraordinary behaviour. You rushed down to Styles, and found it still there?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, and it was a race for time.'' <div class="bookquote">``But I still can't understand why Inglethorp was such a fool as to leave it there when he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had plenty of opportunity to destroy it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Ah, but he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had no opportunity. I saw to that.'' <div class="bookquote">``You?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. Do you remember reproving me for taking the household into my confidence on the subject?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, my friend, I saw there was just one chance.

He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was already under suspicion, and by making the matter public I secured the services of about ten amateur detectives, who would be watching him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) unceasingly, and being himself aware of their watchfulness he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would not dare seek further to destroy the document. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was therefore forced to depart from the house, leaving it in the spill vase.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But surely Miss Howard had ample opportunities of aiding him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Howard</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, but Miss Howard did not know of the paper's existence. In accordance with their prearranged plan, she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) never spoke to Alfred Inglethorp.
<p/>They were supposed to be deadly enemies, and until John Cavendish was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a meeting. Of course I had a watch kept on Mr. Inglethorp, hoping that sooner or later he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) would lead me to the hiding-place. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) was too clever to take any chances. The paper was safe where it was; since no one had thought of looking there in the first week, it was not likely they would do so afterwards. But for your lucky remark, we might never have been able to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) to justice.'' <div class="bookquote">``I understand that now; but when did you first begin to suspect Miss Howard?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``When I discovered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) had told a lie at the inquest about the letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) had received from Mrs. Inglethorp.''

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You will recollect, then, that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote a very distinctive hand, and left large clear spaces between her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) words. But if you look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that `July 17th' is quite different in this respect. Do you see what I mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I confessed, <div class="bookquote">``I don't.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You do not see that that letter was not written on the 17th, but on the 7th--the day after Miss Howard's departure?

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is exactly what I asked myself. Why does Miss Howard suppress the letter written on the 17th, and produce this faked one instead? Because she (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) did not wish to show the letter of the 17th. Why, again? And at once a suspicion dawned in my mind.
<p/>You will remember my saying that it was wise to beware of people who were not telling you the truth.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried indignantly, <div class="bookquote">``after that, you gave me two reasons why Miss Howard could not have committed the crime!''

She (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) could not have committed the crime single-handed, but the reasons against that did not debar her (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) from being an accomplice. And, then, there was that rather over-vehement hatred of hers! It concealed a very opposite emotion. There was, undoubtedly, a tie of passion between them long before he (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) came to Styles. They had already arranged their infamous plot--that he (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) should marry this rich, but rather foolish old lady, induce her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to make a will leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) money to him (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>), and then gain their ends by a very cleverly conceived crime. If all had gone as they planned, they would probably have left England, and lived together on their poor victim's money. <div class="bookquote">``They are a very astute and unscrupulous pair.

She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hides the strychnine and glasses in John's room. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) puts the beard in the attic.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't quite see why they tried to fix the blame on John,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would have been much easier for them to bring the crime home to Lawrence.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, but that was mere chance.

And he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) was perfectly right.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``One thing more.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They were, of course, an accusation against her (<font color='blue'><b>Inglethorp</b></font>) husband.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dear me, Poirot,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said with a sigh, <div class="bookquote">``I think you have explained everything.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My dear friend, do you not realize that it was simply and solely the trial which has brought them together again?
<p/>That John Cavendish still loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) wife , I was convinced. Also, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was equally in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>). But they had drifted very far apart. It all arose from a misunderstanding. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) married him (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) without love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) knew it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) is a sensitive man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) would not force himself upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not want him (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>). And, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) withdrew, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) love awoke. But they are both unusually proud, and their pride held them inexorably apart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) drifted into an entanglement with Mrs. Raikes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Raikes</b></font>) deliberately cultivated the friendship of Dr. Bauerstein. Do you remember the day of John Cavendish's arrest, when you found me deliberating over a big decision?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I quite understood your distress.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me, mon ami , but you did not understand it in the least. I was trying to decide whether or not I would clear John Cavendish at once. I could have cleared him (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>)--though it might have meant a failure to convict the real criminals. They were entirely in the dark as to my real attitude up to the very last moment--which partly accounts for my success.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that you could have saved John Cavendish from being brought to trial?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my friend. But I eventually decided in favour of 'a woman's happiness'. Nothing but the great danger through which they have passed could have brought these two proud souls together again. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked at Poirot in silent amazement. The colossal cheek of the little man! Who on earth but Poirot would have thought of a trial for murder as a restorer of conjugal happiness! <div class="bookquote">``I perceive your thoughts, mon ami ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>said Poirot, smiling at me. '' No one but Hercule Poirot would have attempted such a thing!
<p/>And you are wrong in condemning it. The happiness of one man and one woman is the greatest thing in all the world.'' His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words took me back to earlier events. I remembered Mary as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lay white and exhausted on the sofa, listening, listening. There had come the sound of the bell below. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had started up. Poirot had opened the door, and meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) agonized eyes had nodded gently. '' Yes, madame,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) back to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) had stood aside, and as I went out I had seen the look in Mary's eyes, as John Cavendish had caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) wife in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cavendish</b></font>) arms. '' Perhaps you are right, Poirot,'' I said gently. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is the greatest thing in the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>Suddenly, there was a tap at the door, and Cynthia peeped in. <div class="bookquote">``I--I only--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, springing up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) came in, but did not sit down. <div class="bookquote">``I--only wanted to tell you something--''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>Cynthia fidgeted with a little tassel for some moments, then, suddenly exclaiming: <div class="bookquote">``You dears!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Mademoiselle Cynthia/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>kissed first me and then Poirot, and rushed out of the room again. <div class="bookquote">``What on earth does this mean? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, surprised. It was very nice to be kissed by Cynthia, but the publicity of the salute rather impaired the pleasure. <div class="bookquote">``It means that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) has discovered Monsieur Lawrence does not dislike her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poirot/POIROT/Hercule Poirot</b></font>)</div>replied Poirot philosophically. '' But--'' <div class="bookquote">``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Poirot</b></font>) is. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lawrence/Monsieur Lawrence</b></font>)</div>Lawrence at that moment passed the door. '' Eh! Monsieur Lawrence,'' called Poirot. <div class="bookquote">``We must congratulate you, is it not so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lawrence/Monsieur Lawrence</b></font>)</div>Lawrence blushed, and then smiled awkwardly. A man in love is a sorry spectacle. Now Cynthia had looked charming. I sighed. <div class="bookquote">``What is it, mon ami? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said sadly.
