With his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) long, white, nervous fingers he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) adjusted the delicate needle, and rolled back his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) left shirt-cuff. For some little time his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) eyes rested thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred with innumerable puncture-marks. Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) thrust the sharp point home, pressed down the tiny piston, and sank back into the velvet-lined arm-chair with a long sigh of satisfaction. Three times a day for many months I had witnessed this performance, but custom had not reconciled my mind to it. On the contrary, from day to day I had become more irritable at the sight, and my conscience swelled nightly within me at the thought that I had lacked the courage to protest. Again and again I had registered a vow that I should deliver my soul upon the subject, but there was that in the cool, nonchalant air of my companion which made him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) the last man with whom one would care to take anything approaching to a liberty. His (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) great powers, his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) masterly manner, and the experience which I had had of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) many extraordinary qualities, all made me diffident and backward in crossing him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>). Yet upon that afternoon, whether it was the Beaune which I had taken with my lunch, or the additional exasperation produced by the extreme deliberation of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) manner, I suddenly felt that I could hold out no longer. '' Which is it to-day? '' I asked,--<div class="bookquote">``morphine or cocaine? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) eyes languidly from the old black-letter volume which he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had opened. <div class="bookquote">``It is cocaine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said,--<div class="bookquote">``a seven-per-cent. solution.
<p/>Would you care to try it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, brusquely. <div class="bookquote">``My constitution has not got over the Afghan campaign yet. I cannot afford to throw any extra strain upon it.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Afghan</b></font>) smiled at my vehemence. '' Perhaps you are right, Watson,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose that its influence is physically a bad one. I find it, however, so transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind that its secondary action is a matter of small moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But consider! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``Count the cost! Your brain may, as you say, be roused and excited, but it is a pathological and morbid process, which involves increased tissue-change and may at last leave a permanent weakness. You know, too, what a black reaction comes upon you. Surely the game is hardly worth the candle. Why should you, for a mere passing pleasure, risk the loss of those great powers with which you have been endowed? Remember that I speak not only as one comrade to another, but as a medical man to one for whose constitution he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is to some extent answerable.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not seem offended. On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger-tips together and leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elbows on the arms of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair, like one who has a relish for conversation. '' My mind,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense then with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation. That is why I have chosen my own particular profession,--or rather created it, for I am the only one in the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The only unofficial detective? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, raising my eyebrows. ''
<p/>The only unofficial consulting detective,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I am the last and highest court of appeal in detection. When Gregson or Lestrade or Athelney Jones are out of their depths--which, by the way, is their normal state--the matter is laid before me. I examine the data, as an expert, and pronounce a specialist's opinion. I claim no credit in such cases. My name figures in no newspaper. The work itself, the pleasure of finding a field for my peculiar powers, is my highest reward. But you have yourself had some experience of my methods of work in the Jefferson Hope case.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, cordially. <div class="bookquote">``I was never so struck by anything in my life. I even embodied it in a small brochure with the somewhat fantastic title of 'A Study in Scarlet.' ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) head sadly. <div class="bookquote">``I glanced over it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>). '' Honestly, I cannot congratulate you upon it. Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science, and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner. You have attempted to tinge it with romanticism, which produces much the same effect as if you worked a love-story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of Euclid.'' <div class="bookquote">``But the romance was there,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remonstrated. <div class="bookquote">``I could not tamper with the facts.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Some facts should be suppressed, or at least a just sense of proportion should be observed in treating them. The only point in the case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes by which I succeeded in unraveling it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was annoyed at this criticism of a work which had been specially designed to please him (<font color='blue'><b>Euclid</b></font>).
<p/>I confess, too, that I was irritated by the egotism which seemed to demand that every line of my pamphlet should be devoted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Euclid</b></font>) own special doings. More than once during the years that I had lived with him (<font color='blue'><b>Euclid</b></font>) in Baker Street I had observed that a small vanity underlay my companion's quiet and didactic manner. I made no remark, however, but sat nursing my wounded leg. I had a Jezail bullet through it some time before, and, though it did not prevent me from walking, it ached wearily at every change of the weather. <div class="bookquote">``My practice has extended recently to the Continent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, after a while, filling up his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) old brier-root pipe. <div class="bookquote">``I was consulted last week by Francois Le Villard, who, as you probably know, has come rather to the front lately in the French detective service. He (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) has all the Celtic power of quick intuition, but he (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) is deficient in the wide range of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developments of his (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) art. The case was concerned with a will, and possessed some features of interest. I was able to refer him (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) to two parallel cases, the one at Riga in 1857, and the other at St. Louis in 1871, which have suggested to him (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) the true solution. Here is the letter which I had this morning acknowledging my assistance.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) tossed over, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) spoke, a crumpled sheet of foreign notepaper. I glanced my eyes down it, catching a profusion of notes of admiration, with stray <div class="bookquote">``magnifiques,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``coup-de-maitres,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``tours-de-force,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>all testifying to the ardent admiration of the Frenchman. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) speaks as a pupil to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) master,'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) rates my assistance too highly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Sherlock Holmes, lightly. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) has considerable gifts himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) possesses two out of the three qualities necessary for the ideal detective. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) has the power of observation and that of deduction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) is only wanting in knowledge; and that may come in time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) is now translating my small works into French.'' <div class="bookquote">``Your works?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, didn't you know? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) cried, laughing. '' Yes, I have been guilty of several monographs. They are all upon technical subjects. Here, for example, is one `Upon the Distinction between the Ashes of the Various Tobaccoes.' In it I enumerate a hundred and forty forms of cigar-, cigarette-, and pipe-tobacco, with colored plates illustrating the difference in the ash. It is a point which is continually turning up in criminal trials, and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a clue. If you can say definitely, for example, that some murder has been done by a man who was smoking an Indian lunkah, it obviously narrows your field of search. To the trained eye there is as much difference between the black ash of a Trichinopoly and the white fluff of bird's-eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato.'' <div class="bookquote">``You have an extraordinary genius for minutiae,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked. <div class="bookquote">``I appreciate their importance. Here is my monograph upon the tracing of footsteps, with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of Paris as a preserver of impresses. Here, too, is a curious little work upon the influence of a trade upon the form of the hand, with lithotypes of the hands of slaters, sailors, corkcutters, compositors, weavers, and diamond-polishers. That is a matter of great practical interest to the scientific detective,--especially in cases of unclaimed bodies, or in discovering the antecedents of criminals. But I weary you with my hobby.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, earnestly. ''
<p/>It is of the greatest interest to me, especially since I have had the opportunity of observing your practical application of it. But you spoke just now of observation and deduction. Surely the one to some extent implies the other.'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, hardly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) answered, leaning back luxuriously in his (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) arm-chair, and sending up thick blue wreaths from his (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) pipe. '' For example, observation shows me that you have been to the Wigmore Street Post-Office this morning, but deduction lets me know that when there you dispatched a telegram.'' <div class="bookquote">``Right!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. '' Right on both points! But I confess that I don't see how you arrived at it. It was a sudden impulse upon my part, and I have mentioned it to no one.'' <div class="bookquote">``It is simplicity itself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) remarked, chuckling at my surprise,--<div class="bookquote">``so absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous; and yet it may serve to define the limits of observation and of deduction. Observation tells me that you have a little reddish mould adhering to your instep. Just opposite the Seymour Street Office they have taken up the pavement and thrown up some earth which lies in such a way that it is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering. The earth is of this peculiar reddish tint which is found, as far as I know, nowhere else in the neighborhood. So much is observation. The rest is deduction.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How, then, did you deduce the telegram?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, of course I knew that you had not written a letter, since I sat opposite to you all morning. I see also in your open desk there that you have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of post-cards. What could you go into the post-office for, then, but to send a wire?
<p/>Eliminate all other factors, and the one which remains must be the truth.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``In this case it certainly is so,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied, after a little thought. '' The thing, however, is, as you say, of the simplest. Would you think me impertinent if I were to put your theories to a more severe test?'' <div class="bookquote">``On the contrary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``it would prevent me from taking a second dose of cocaine. I should be delighted to look into any problem which you might submit to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object in daily use without leaving the impress of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) individuality upon it in such a way that a trained observer might read it. Now, I have here a watch which has recently come into my possession. Would you have the kindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the late owner? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I handed him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) over the watch with some slight feeling of amusement in my heart, for the test was, as I thought, an impossible one, and I intended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) occasionally assumed. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) balanced the watch in his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) hand, gazed hard at the dial, opened the back, and examined the works, first with his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) naked eyes and then with a powerful convex lens. I could hardly keep from smiling at his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) crestfallen face when he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) finally snapped the case to and handed it back. <div class="bookquote">``There are hardly any data,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) remarked. '' The watch has been recently cleaned, which robs me of my most suggestive facts.'' <div class="bookquote">``You are right,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. <div class="bookquote">``It was cleaned before being sent to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>In my heart I accused my companion of putting forward a most lame and impotent excuse to cover his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) failure. What data could he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) expect from an uncleaned watch? '' Though unsatisfactory, my research has not been entirely barren,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) observed, staring up at the ceiling with dreamy, lack-lustre eyes. '' Subject to your correction, I should judge that the watch belonged to your elder brother, who inherited it from your father.'' <div class="bookquote">``That you gather, no doubt, from the H. W. upon the back?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Quite so. The W. suggests your own name. The date of the watch is nearly fifty years back, and the initials are as old as the watch: so it was made for the last generation. Jewelry usually descends to the eldest son, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is most likely to have the same name as the father. Your father has, if I remember right, been dead many years. It has, therefore, been in the hands of your eldest brother.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Right, so far,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Anything else?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was a man of untidy habits,--very untidy and careless. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was left with good prospects, but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) threw away his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) chances, lived for some time in poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity, and finally, taking to drink, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) died. That is all I can gather. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room with considerable bitterness in my heart. <div class="bookquote">``This is unworthy of you, Holmes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``I could not have believed that you would have descended to this. You have made inquires into the history of my unhappy brother, and you now pretend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful way. You cannot expect me to believe that you have read all this from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) old watch!
<p/>It is unkind, and, to speak plainly, has a touch of charlatanism in it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My dear doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), kindly, <div class="bookquote">``pray accept my apologies. Viewing the matter as an abstract problem, I had forgotten how personal and painful a thing it might be to you. I assure you, however, that I never even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts? They are absolutely correct in every particular.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that is good luck. I could only say what was the balance of probability. I did not at all expect to be so accurate.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But it was not mere guess-work?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no: I never guess. It is a shocking habit,--destructive to the logical faculty. What seems strange to you is only so because you do not follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which large inferences may depend. For example, I began by stating that your brother was careless. When you observe the lower part of that watch-case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places, but it is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard objects, such as coins or keys, in the same pocket. Surely it is no great feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty-guinea watch so cavalierly must be a careless man. Neither is it a very far-fetched inference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty well provided for in other respects. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I nodded, to show that I followed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reasoning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very customary for pawnbrokers in England, when they take a watch, to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin-point upon the inside of the case. It is more handy than a label, as there is no risk of the number being lost or transposed. There are no less than four such numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case. Inference,--that your brother was often at low water. Secondary inference,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had occasional bursts of prosperity, or he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could not have redeemed the pledge. Finally, I ask you to look at the inner plate, which contains the key-hole. Look at the thousands of scratches all round the hole,--marks where the key has slipped. What sober man's key could have scored those grooves? But you will never see a drunkard's watch without them. He (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) winds it at night, and he (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) leaves these traces of his (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) unsteady hand. Where is the mystery in all this?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is as clear as daylight,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. <div class="bookquote">``I regret the injustice which I did you. I should have had more faith in your marvellous faculty. May I ask whether you have any professional inquiry on foot at present?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``None. Hence the cocaine. I cannot live without brain-work. What else is there to live for? Stand at the window here. Was ever such a dreary, dismal, unprofitable world? See how the yellow fog swirls down the street and drifts across the dun-colored houses. What could be more hopelessly prosaic and material? What is the use of having powers, doctor, when one has no field upon which to exert them? Crime is commonplace, existence is commonplace, and no qualities save those which are commonplace have any function upon earth.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had opened my mouth to reply to this tirade, when with a crisp knock our landlady entered, bearing a card upon the brass salver. '' A young lady for you, sir,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, addressing my companion. '' Miss Mary Morstan,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) read. <div class="bookquote">``Hum! I have no recollection of the name. Ask the young lady to step up, Mrs. Hudson. Don't go, doctor. I should prefer that you remain.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Chapter II The Statement of the Case Miss Morstan entered the room with a firm step and an outward composure of manner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hudson</b></font>) was a blonde young lady, small, dainty, well gloved, and dressed in the most perfect taste. There was, however, a plainness and simplicity about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hudson</b></font>) costume which bore with it a suggestion of limited means. The dress was a sombre grayish beige, untrimmed and unbraided, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hudson</b></font>) wore a small turban of the same dull hue, relieved only by a suspicion of white feather in the side. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hudson</b></font>) face had neither regularity of feature nor beauty of complexion, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Hudson</b></font>) expression was sweet and amiable, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hudson</b></font>) large blue eyes were singularly spiritual and sympathetic. In an experience of women which extends over many nations and three separate continents, I have never looked upon a face which gave a clearer promise of a refined and sensitive nature. I could not but observe that as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hudson</b></font>) took the seat which Sherlock Holmes placed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hudson</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Hudson</b></font>) lip trembled, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hudson</b></font>) hand quivered, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hudson</b></font>) showed every sign of intense inward agitation. <div class="bookquote">``I have come to you, Mr. Holmes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hudson</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``because you once enabled my employer, Mrs. Cecil Forrester, to unravel a little domestic complication. She (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) was much impressed by your kindness and skill.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Cecil Forrester,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) repeated thoughtfully.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe that I was of some slight service to her (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>). The case, however, as I remember it, was a very simple one.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) did not think so. But at least you cannot say the same of mine. I can hardly imagine anything more strange, more utterly inexplicable, than the situation in which I find myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>Holmes rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) hands, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) eyes glistened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) leaned forward in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) clear-cut, hawklike features. <div class="bookquote">``State your case,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), in brisk, business tones. I felt that my position was an embarrassing one. <div class="bookquote">``You will, I am sure, excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, rising from my chair. To my surprise, the young lady held up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gloved hand to detain me. <div class="bookquote">``If your friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``would be good enough to stop, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might be of inestimable service to me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I relapsed into my chair. '' Briefly,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``the facts are these. My father was an officer in an Indian regiment who sent me home when I was quite a child. My mother was dead, and I had no relative in England. I was placed, however, in a comfortable boarding establishment at Edinburgh, and there I remained until I was seventeen years of age. In the year 1878 my father, who was senior captain of his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) regiment, obtained twelve months' leave and came home. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) telegraphed to me from London that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had arrived all safe, and directed me to come down at once, giving the Langham Hotel as his (<font color='blue'><b>Langham</b></font>) address. His (<font color='blue'><b>Langham</b></font>) message, as I remember, was full of kindness and love. On reaching London I drove to the Langham, and was informed that Captain Morstan was staying there, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had gone out the night before and had not yet returned.
<p/>I waited all day without news of him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). That night, on the advice of the manager of the hotel, I communicated with the police, and next morning we advertised in all the papers. Our inquiries led to no result; and from that day to this no word has ever been heard of my unfortunate father. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came home with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart full of hope, to find some peace, some comfort, and instead--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) throat, and a choking sob cut short the sentence. '' The date?'' asked Holmes, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) note-book. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) disappeared upon the 3d of December, 1878,--nearly ten years ago.'' <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) luggage?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Remained at the hotel. There was nothing in it to suggest a clue,--some clothes, some books, and a considerable number of curiosities from the Andaman Islands.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) any friends in town?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Only one that we know of,--Major Sholto, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) own regiment, the 34th Bombay Infantry. The major had retired some little time before, and lived at Upper Norwood.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A singular case,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>remarked Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``I have not yet described to you the most singular part. About six years ago--to be exact, upon the 4th of May, 1882--an advertisement appeared in the Times asking for the address of Miss Mary Morstan and stating that it would be to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morstan</b></font>) advantage to come forward. There was no name or address appended. I had at that time just entered the family of Mrs. Cecil Forrester in the capacity of governess. By her (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) advice I published my address in the advertisement column.
<p/>The same day there arrived through the post a small card-board box addressed to me, which I found to contain a very large and lustrous pearl. No word of writing was enclosed. Since then every year upon the same date there has always appeared a similar box, containing a similar pearl, without any clue as to the sender. They have been pronounced by an expert to be of a rare variety and of considerable value. You can see for yourselves that they are very handsome.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) opened a flat box as she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) spoke, and showed me six of the finest pearls that I had ever seen. <div class="bookquote">``Your statement is most interesting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Sherlock Holmes. '' Has anything else occurred to you?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, and no later than to-day. That is why I have come to you.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``The envelope too, please.

If you are distrustful, bring two friends. You are a wronged woman, and shall have justice. Do not bring police. If you do, all will be in vain. Your unknown friend.' Well, really, this is a very pretty little mystery. What do you intend to do, Miss Morstan?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is exactly what I want to ask you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then we shall most certainly go. You and I and--yes, why, Dr. Watson is the very man. Your correspondent says two friends.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be proud and happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, fervently, <div class="bookquote">``if I can be of any service.''

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have them here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) answered, producing half a dozen pieces of paper. <div class="bookquote">``You are certainly a model client. You have the correct intuition. Let us see, now.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) spread out the papers upon the table, and gave little darting glances from one to the other. <div class="bookquote">``They are disguised hands, except the letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) said, presently, <div class="bookquote">``but there can be no question as to the authorship.

I should not like to suggest false hopes, Miss Morstan, but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of your father?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing could be more unlike.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I expected to hear you say so. We shall look out for you, then, at six. Pray allow me to keep the papers. I may look into the matter before then. It is only half-past three. Au revoir, then.''  (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div>'' Au revoir,'' said our visitor, and, with a bright, kindly glance from one to the other of us, she (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) replaced her (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) pearl-box in her (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) bosom and hurried away. Standing at the window, I watched her (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) walking briskly down the street, until the gray turban and white feather were but a speck in the sombre crowd. <div class="bookquote">``What a very attractive woman! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed, turning to my companion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had lit his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) pipe again, and was leaning back with drooping eyelids. <div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said, languidly. <div class="bookquote">``I did not observe.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You really are an automaton,--a calculating-machine! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried. <div class="bookquote">``There is something positively inhuman in you at times.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) smiled gently. '' It is of the first importance,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``not to allow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities. A client is to me a mere unit,--a factor in a problem. The emotional qualities are antagonistic to clear reasoning. I assure you that the most winning woman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for their insurance-money, and the most repellant man of my acquaintance is a philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the London poor.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``In this case, however--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I never make exceptions.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is legible and regular,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. <div class="bookquote">``A man of business habits and some force of character.

There is vacillation in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) k's and self-esteem in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) capitals. I am going out now. I have some few references to make. Let me recommend this book,--one of the most remarkable ever penned. It is Winwood Reade's `Martyrdom of Man.' I shall be back in an hour. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sat in the window with the volume in my hand, but my thoughts were far from the daring speculations of the writer.
<p/>My mind ran upon our late visitor,--her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) smiles, the deep rich tones of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) voice, the strange mystery which overhung her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) life. If she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) were seventeen at the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) father's disappearance she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must be seven-and-twenty now,--a sweet age, when youth has lost its self-consciousness and become a little sobered by experience. So I sat and mused, until such dangerous thoughts came into my head that I hurried away to my desk and plunged furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology. What was I, an army surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker banking-account, that I should dare to think of such things? She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was a unit, a factor,--nothing more. If my future were black, it was better surely to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will-o'-the-wisps of the imagination. Chapter III In Quest of a Solution It was half-past five before Holmes returned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was bright, eager, and in excellent spirits,--a mood which in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) case alternated with fits of the blackest depression. <div class="bookquote">``There is no great mystery in this matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said, taking the cup of tea which I had poured out for him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). '' The facts appear to admit of only one explanation.'' <div class="bookquote">``What! you have solved it already?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, that would be too much to say. I have discovered a suggestive fact, that is all. It is, however, VERY suggestive. The details are still to be added. I have just found, on consulting the back files of the Times, that Major Sholto, of Upper Norword, late of the 34th Bombay Infantry, died upon the 28th of April, 1882.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I may be very obtuse, Holmes, but I fail to see what this suggests.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No? You surprise me. Look at it in this way, then. Captain Morstan disappears.
<p/>The only person in London whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) could have visited is Major Sholto. Major Sholto denies having heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) was in London. Four years later Sholto dies. WITHIN A WEEK OF HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) DEATH Captain Morstan's daughter receives a valuable present, which is repeated from year to year, and now culminates in a letter which describes her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) as a wronged woman. What wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father? And why should the presents begin immediately after Sholto's death, unless it is that Sholto's heir knows something of the mystery and desires to make compensation? Have you any alternative theory which will meet the facts?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But what a strange compensation! And how strangely made! Why, too, should he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) write a letter now, rather than six years ago? Again, the letter speaks of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) justice. What justice can she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) have? It is too much to suppose that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father is still alive. There is no other injustice in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) case that you know of.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There are difficulties; there are certainly difficulties,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Sherlock Holmes, pensively. '' But our expedition of to-night will solve them all. Ah, here is a four-wheeler, and Miss Morstan is inside. Are you all ready? Then we had better go down, for it is a little past the hour. '' I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but I observed that Holmes took his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) revolver from his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) drawer and slipped it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) pocket. It was clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) thought that our night's work might be a serious one. Miss Morstan was muffled in a dark cloak, and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sensitive face was composed, but pale.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) must have been more than woman if she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) did not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were embarking, yet her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) self-control was perfect, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) readily answered the few additional questions which Sherlock Holmes put to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). '' Major Sholto was a very particular friend of papa's,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) letters were full of allusions to the major. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) and papa were in command of the troops at the Andaman Islands, so they were thrown a great deal together. By the way, a curious paper was found in papa's desk which no one could understand. I don't suppose that it is of the slightest importance, but I thought you might care to see it, so I brought it with me. It is here. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>Holmes unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) knee. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) then very methodically examined it all over with his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) double lens. <div class="bookquote">``It is paper of native Indian manufacture,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) remarked. <div class="bookquote">``It has at some time been pinned to a board. The diagram upon it appears to be a plan of part of a large building with numerous halls, corridors, and passages. At one point is a small cross done in red ink, and above it is '3.37 from left,' in faded pencil-writing. In the left-hand corner is a curious hieroglyphic like four crosses in a line with their arms touching. Beside it is written, in very rough and coarse characters, `The sign of the four,--Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, Dost Akbar.' No, I confess that I do not see how this bears upon the matter. Yet it is evidently a document of importance. It has been kept carefully in a pocket-book; for the one side is as clean as the other.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Akbar</b></font>) pocket-book that we found it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Preserve it carefully, then, Miss Morstan, for it may prove to be of use to us. I begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much deeper and more subtle than I at first supposed. I must reconsider my ideas.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Akbar</b></font>) leaned back in the cab, and I could see by his (<font color='blue'><b>Akbar</b></font>) drawn brow and his (<font color='blue'><b>Akbar</b></font>) vacant eye that he (<font color='blue'><b>Akbar</b></font>) was thinking intently. Miss Morstan and I chatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible outcome, but our companion maintained his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) impenetrable reserve until the end of our journey. It was a September evening, and not yet seven o'clock, but the day had been a dreary one, and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city. Mud-colored clouds drooped sadly over the muddy streets. Down the Strand the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light which threw a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement. The yellow glare from the shop-windows streamed out into the steamy, vaporous air, and threw a murky, shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare. There was, to my mind, something eerie and ghost-like in the endless procession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars of light,--sad faces and glad, haggard and merry. Like all human kind, they flitted from the gloom into the light, and so back into the gloom once more. I am not subject to impressions, but the dull, heavy evening, with the strange business upon which we were engaged, combined to make me nervous and depressed. I could see from Miss Morstan's manner that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was suffering from the same feeling. Holmes alone could rise superior to petty influences.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) open note-book upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) knee, and from time to time he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) jotted down figures and memoranda in the light of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) pocket-lantern. At the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were already thick at the side-entrances. In front a continuous stream of hansoms and four-wheelers were rattling up, discharging their cargoes of shirt-fronted men and beshawled, bediamonded women. We had hardly reached the third pillar, which was our rendezvous, before a small, dark, brisk man in the dress of a coachman accosted us. '' Are you the parties who come with Miss Morstan? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``I am Miss Morstan, and these two gentlemen are my friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us. <div class="bookquote">``You will excuse me, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said with a certain dogged manner, <div class="bookquote">``but I was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companions is a police-officer.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I give you my word on that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) answered. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave a shrill whistle, on which a street Arab led across a four-wheeler and opened the door. The man who had addressed us mounted to the box, while we took our places inside. We had hardly done so before the driver whipped up his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) horse, and we plunged away at a furious pace through the foggy streets. The situation was a curious one. We were driving to an unknown place, on an unknown errand. Yet our invitation was either a complete hoax,--which was an inconceivable hypothesis,--or else we had good reason to think that important issues might hang upon our journey. Miss Morstan's demeanor was as resolute and collected as ever. I endeavored to cheer and amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) by reminiscences of my adventures in Afghanistan; but, to tell the truth
<p/>, I was myself so excited at our situation and so curious as to our destination that my stories were slightly involved. To this day she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) declares that I told her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) one moving anecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of night, and how I fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it. At first I had some idea as to the direction in which we were driving; but soon, what with our pace, the fog, and my own limited knowledge of London, I lost my bearings, and knew nothing, save that we seemed to be going a very long way. Sherlock Holmes was never at fault, however, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) muttered the names as the cab rattled through squares and in and out by tortuous by-streets. '' Rochester Row,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Now Vincent Square. Now we come out on the Vauxhall Bridge Road. We are making for the Surrey side, apparently. Yes, I thought so. Now we are on the bridge. You can catch glimpses of the river. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We did indeed get a fleeting view of a stretch of the Thames with the lamps shining upon the broad, silent water; but our cab dashed on, and was soon involved in a labyrinth of streets upon the other side. '' Wordsworth Road,'' said my companion. <div class="bookquote">``Priory Road. Lark Hall Lane. Stockwell Place. Robert Street. Cold Harbor Lane. Our quest does not appear to take us to very fashionable regions. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We had, indeed, reached a questionable and forbidding neighborhood. Long lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarse glare and tawdry brilliancy of public houses at the corner.
<p/>Then came rows of two-storied villas each with a fronting of miniature garden, and then again interminable lines of new staring brick buildings,--the monster tentacles which the giant city was throwing out into the country. At last the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace. None of the other houses were inhabited, and that at which we stopped was as dark as its neighbors, save for a single glimmer in the kitchen window. On our knocking, however, the door was instantly thrown open by a Hindoo servant clad in a yellow turban, white loose-fitting clothes, and a yellow sash. There was something strangely incongruous in this Oriental figure framed in the commonplace door-way of a third-rate suburban dwelling-house. '' The Sahib awaits you,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>), and even as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) spoke there came a high piping voice from some inner room. <div class="bookquote">``Show them in to me, khitmutgar,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it cried. <div class="bookquote">``Show them straight in to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Man</b></font>)</div>Chapter IV The Story of the Bald-Headed Man We followed the Indian down a sordid and common passage, ill lit and worse furnished, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) came to a door upon the right, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) threw open. A blaze of yellow light streamed out upon us, and in the centre of the glare there stood a small man with a very high head, a bristle of red hair all round the fringe of it, and a bald, shining scalp which shot out from among it like a mountain-peak from fir-trees. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) writhed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands together as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) features were in a perpetual jerk, now smiling, now scowling, but never for an instant in repose.
<p/>Nature had given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a pendulous lip, and a too visible line of yellow and irregular teeth, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strove feebly to conceal by constantly passing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand over the lower part of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face. In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) obtrusive baldness, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave the impression of youth. In point of fact he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had just turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thirtieth year. '' Your servant, Miss Morstan,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) kept repeating, in a thin, high voice. '' Your servant, gentlemen. Pray step into my little sanctum. A small place, miss, but furnished to my own liking. An oasis of art in the howling desert of South London. '' We were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) invited us. In that sorry house it looked as out of place as a diamond of the first water in a setting of brass. The richest and glossiest of curtains and tapestries draped the walls, looped back here and there to expose some richly-mounted painting or Oriental vase. The carpet was of amber-and-black, so soft and so thick that the foot sank pleasantly into it, as into a bed of moss. Two great tiger-skins thrown athwart it increased the suggestion of Eastern luxury, as did a huge hookah which stood upon a mat in the corner. A lamp in the fashion of a silver dove was hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre of the room. As it burned it filled the air with a subtle and aromatic odor. '' Mr. Thaddeus Sholto,'' said the little man, still jerking and smiling. <div class="bookquote">``That is my name. You are Miss Morstan, of course. And these gentlemen--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and this is Dr. Watson.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A doctor, eh? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), much excited. <div class="bookquote">``Have you your stethoscope?
<p/>Might I ask you--would you have the kindness? I have grave doubts as to my mitral valve, if you would be so very good. The aortic I may rely upon, but I should value your opinion upon the mitral. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I listened to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) heart, as requested, but was unable to find anything amiss, save indeed that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was in an ecstasy of fear, for he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) shivered from head to foot. <div class="bookquote">``It appears to be normal,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``You have no cause for uneasiness.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You will excuse my anxiety, Miss Morstan,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) remarked, airily. <div class="bookquote">``I am a great sufferer, and I have long had suspicions as to that valve. I am delighted to hear that they are unwarranted. Had your father, Miss Morstan, refrained from throwing a strain upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might have been alive now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could have struck the man across the face, so hot was I at this callous and off-hand reference to so delicate a matter. Miss Morstan sat down, and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face grew white to the lips. <div class="bookquote">``I knew in my heart that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I can give you every information,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and, what is more, I can do you justice; and I will, too, whatever Brother Bartholomew may say. I am so glad to have your friends here, not only as an escort to you, but also as witnesses to what I am about to do and say. The three of us can show a bold front to Brother Bartholomew. But let us have no outsiders,--no police or officials. We can settle everything satisfactorily among ourselves, without any interference. Nothing would annoy Brother Bartholomew more than any publicity.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) sat down upon a low settee and blinked at us inquiringly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) weak, watery blue eyes. ''
<p/>For my part,'' said Holmes, <div class="bookquote">``whatever you may choose to say will go no further. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>I nodded to show my agreement. <div class="bookquote">``That is well! That is well!''

I keep no other wines. Shall I open a flask? No? Well, then, I trust that you have no objection to tobacco-smoke, to the mild balsamic odor of the Eastern tobacco.

(<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) applied a taper to the great bowl, and the smoke bubbled merrily through the rose-water. We sat all three in a semicircle, with our heads advanced, and our chins upon our hands, while the strange, jerky little fellow, with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) high, shining head, puffed uneasily in the centre. <div class="bookquote">``When I first determined to make this communication to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I might have given you my address, but I feared that you might disregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you.

You will excuse these precautions, but I am a man of somewhat retiring, and I might even say refined, tastes, and there is nothing more unaesthetic than a policeman. I have a natural shrinking from all forms of rough materialism. I seldom come in contact with the rough crowd. I live, as you see, with some little atmosphere of elegance around me. I may call myself a patron of the arts. It is my weakness.

I had quite high words with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) last night. You cannot imagine what a terrible fellow he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is angry.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If we are to go to Norwood it would perhaps be as well to start at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I ventured to remark. He (<font color='blue'><b>Norwood</b></font>) laughed until his (<font color='blue'><b>Norwood</b></font>) ears were quite red. <div class="bookquote">``That would hardly do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Norwood</b></font>) cried. ``I don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Norwood</b></font>) would say if I brought you in that sudden way. No, I must prepare you by showing you how we all stand to each other. In the first place, I must tell you that there are several points in the story of which I am myself ignorant. I can only lay the facts before you as far as I know them myself. ``My father was, as you may have guessed, Major John Sholto, once of the Indian army. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) retired some eleven years ago, and came to live at Pondicherry Lodge in Upper Norwood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Norwood</b></font>) had prospered in India, and brought back with him (<font color='blue'><b>Norwood</b></font>) a considerable sum of money, a large collection of valuable curiosities, and a staff of native servants. With these advantages he (<font color='blue'><b>Norwood</b></font>) bought himself a house, and lived in great luxury. My twin-brother Bartholomew and I were the only children. ``I very well remember the sensation which was caused by the disappearance of Captain Morstan. We read the details in the papers, and, knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had been a friend of our father's, we discussed the case freely in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) presence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) used to join in our speculations as to what could have happened. Never for an instant did we suspect that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had the whole secret hidden in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) own breast,--that of all men he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) alone knew the fate of Arthur Morstan. ``We did know, however, that some mystery--some positive danger--overhung our father. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was very fearful of going out alone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always employed two prize-fighters to act as porters at Pondicherry Lodge. Williams, who drove you to-night, was one of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) was once light-weight champion of England. Our father would never tell us what it was he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feared, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had a most marked aversion to men with wooden legs. On one occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) actually fired his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) revolver at a wooden-legged man, who proved to be a harmless tradesman canvassing for orders. We had to pay a large sum to hush the matter up. My brother and I used to think this a mere whim of my father's, but events have since led us to change our opinion. ``Early in 1882 my father received a letter from India which was a great shock to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) nearly fainted at the breakfast-table when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) opened it, and from that day he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sickened to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) death.
<p/>What was in the letter we could never discover, but I could see as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) held it that it was short and written in a scrawling hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had suffered for years from an enlarged spleen, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) now became rapidly worse, and towards the end of April we were informed that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was beyond all hope, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wished to make a last communication to us. <div class="bookquote">``When we entered his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) room he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was propped up with pillows and breathing heavily. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) besought us to lock the door and to come upon either side of the bed. Then, grasping our hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) made a remarkable statement to us, in a voice which was broken as much by emotion as by pain. I shall try and give it to you in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own very words. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'I have only one thing,' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, `which weighs upon my mind at this supreme moment. It is my treatment of poor Morstan's orphan. The cursed greed which has been my besetting sin through life has withheld from her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the treasure, half at least of which should have been hers. And yet I have made no use of it myself,--so blind and foolish a thing is avarice. The mere feeling of possession has been so dear to me that I could not bear to share it with another. See that chaplet dipped with pearls beside the quinine-bottle. Even that I could not bear to part with, although I had got it out with the design of sending it to her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). You, my sons, will give her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a fair share of the Agra treasure. But send her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) nothing--not even the chaplet--until I am gone. After all, men have been as bad as this and have recovered. ''
<p/>'I will tell you how Morstan died,' he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) continued. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had suffered for years from a weak heart, but he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) concealed it from every one. I alone knew it. When in India, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) and I, through a remarkable chain of circumstances, came into possession of a considerable treasure. I brought it over to England, and on the night of Morstan's arrival he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) came straight over here to claim his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) share. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) walked over from the station, and was admitted by my faithful Lal Chowdar, who is now dead. Morstan and I had a difference of opinion as to the division of the treasure, and we came to heated words. Morstan had sprung out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chowdar</b></font>) chair in a paroxysm of anger, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chowdar</b></font>) suddenly pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Chowdar</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chowdar</b></font>) side, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chowdar</b></font>) face turned a dusky hue, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chowdar</b></font>) fell backwards, cutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Chowdar</b></font>) head against the corner of the treasure-chest. When I stooped over him (<font color='blue'><b>Chowdar</b></font>) I found, to my horror, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chowdar</b></font>) was dead. '' `For a long time I sat half distracted, wondering what I should do. My first impulse was, of course, to call for assistance; but I could not but recognize that there was every chance that I would be accused of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chowdar</b></font>) murder. His (<font color='blue'><b>Chowdar</b></font>) death at the moment of a quarrel, and the gash in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chowdar</b></font>) head, would be black against me. Again, an official inquiry could not be made without bringing out some facts about the treasure, which I was particularly anxious to keep secret. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chowdar</b></font>) had told me that no soul upon earth knew where he (<font color='blue'><b>Chowdar</b></font>) had gone. There seemed to be no necessity why any soul ever should know. '''I was still pondering over the matter, when, looking up, I saw my servant, Lal Chowdar, in the doorway.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chowdar</b></font>) stole in and bolted the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Chowdar</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do not fear, Sahib,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) said. '' No one need know that you have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>). Let us hide him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) away, and who is the wiser?'' <div class="bookquote">``I did not kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. Lal Chowdar shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Lal</b></font>) head and smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I heard it all, Sahib,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I heard you quarrel, and I heard the blow. But my lips are sealed. All are asleep in the house. Let us put him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) away together. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>That was enough to decide me. If my own servant could not believe my innocence, how could I hope to make it good before twelve foolish tradesmen in a jury-box? Lal Chowdar and I disposed of the body that night, and within a few days the London papers were full of the mysterious disappearance of Captain Morstan. You will see from what I say that I can hardly be blamed in the matter. My fault lies in the fact that we concealed not only the body, but also the treasure, and that I have clung to Morstan's share as well as to my own. I wish you, therefore, to make restitution. Put your ears down to my mouth. The treasure is hidden in--' At this instant a horrible change came over his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) expression; his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) eyes stared wildly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) jaw dropped, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) yelled, in a voice which I can never forget, `Keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) out! For Christ's sake keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) out!' We both stared round at the window behind us upon which his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) gaze was fixed. A face was looking in at us out of the darkness. We could see the whitening of the nose where it was pressed against the glass. It was a bearded, hairy face, with wild cruel eyes and an expression of concentrated malevolence.
<p/>My brother and I rushed towards the window, but the man was gone. When we returned to my father his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head had dropped and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pulse had ceased to beat. <div class="bookquote">``We searched the garden that night, but found no sign of the intruder, save that just under the window a single footmark was visible in the flower-bed. But for that one trace, we might have thought that our imaginations had conjured up that wild, fierce face. We soon, however, had another and a more striking proof that there were secret agencies at work all round us. The window of my father's room was found open in the morning, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cupboards and boxes had been rifled, and upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chest was fixed a torn piece of paper, with the words `The sign of the four' scrawled across it. What the phrase meant, or who our secret visitor may have been, we never knew. As far as we can judge, none of my father's property had been actually stolen, though everything had been turned out. My brother and I naturally associated this peculiar incident with the fear which haunted my father during his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life; but it is still a complete mystery to us. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The little man stopped to relight his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hookah and puffed thoughtfully for a few moments. We had all sat absorbed, listening to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) extraordinary narrative. At the short account of her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) father's death Miss Morstan had turned deadly white, and for a moment I feared that she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) was about to faint. She (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) rallied however, on drinking a glass of water which I quietly poured out for her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) from a Venetian carafe upon the side-table. Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) chair with an abstracted expression and the lids drawn low over his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) glittering eyes.
<p/>As I glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) I could not but think how on that very day he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) had complained bitterly of the commonplaceness of life. Here at least was a problem which would tax his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) sagacity to the utmost. Mr. Thaddeus Sholto looked from one to the other of us with an obvious pride at the effect which his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) story had produced, and then continued between the puffs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) overgrown pipe. '' My brother and I,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``were, as you may imagine, much excited as to the treasure which my father had spoken of. For weeks and for months we dug and delved in every part of the garden, without discovering its whereabouts. It was maddening to think that the hiding-place was on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) very lips at the moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) died. We could judge the splendor of the missing riches by the chaplet which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had taken out. Over this chaplet my brother Bartholomew and I had some little discussion. The pearls were evidently of great value, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) was averse to part with them, for, between friends, my brother was himself a little inclined to my father's fault. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought, too, that if we parted with the chaplet it might give rise to gossip and finally bring us into trouble. It was all that I could do to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to let me find out Miss Morstan's address and send her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a detached pearl at fixed intervals, so that at least she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might never feel destitute.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was a kindly thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said our companion, earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``It was extremely good of you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The little man waved his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand deprecatingly. <div class="bookquote">``We were your trustees,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``That was the view which I took of it, though Brother Bartholomew could not altogether see it in that light.
<p/>We had plenty of money ourselves. I desired no more. Besides, it would have been such bad taste to have treated a young lady in so scurvy a fashion. ' Le mauvais gout mene au crime.' The French have a very neat way of putting these things. Our difference of opinion on this subject went so far that I thought it best to set up rooms for myself: so I left Pondicherry Lodge, taking the old khitmutgar and Williams with me. Yesterday, however, I learn that an event of extreme importance has occurred. The treasure has been discovered. I instantly communicated with Miss Morstan, and it only remains for us to drive out to Norwood and demand our share. I explained my views last night to Brother Bartholomew: so we shall be expected, if not welcome, visitors.''  (<font color='red'><b>Thaddeus Sholto/Mr. Thaddeus/Mr. Thaddeus Sholto</b></font>)</div>Mr. Thaddeus Sholto ceased, and sat twitching on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) luxurious settee. We all remained silent, with our thoughts upon the new development which the mysterious business had taken. Holmes was the first to spring to his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``You have done well, sir, from first to last,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It is possible that we may be able to make you some small return by throwing some light upon that which is still dark to you. But, as Miss Morstan remarked just now, it is late, and we had best put the matter through without delay. ''  (<font color='red'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)</div>Our new acquaintance very deliberately coiled up the tube of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) hookah, and produced from behind a curtain a very long befrogged topcoat with Astrakhan collar and cuffs. This
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) buttoned tightly up, in spite of the extreme closeness of the night, and finished his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) attire by putting on a rabbit-skin cap with hanging lappets which covered the ears, so that no part of him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was visible save his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) mobile and peaky face. <div class="bookquote">``My health is somewhat fragile,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) remarked, as he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) led the way down the passage. <div class="bookquote">``I am compelled to be a valetudinarian. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>Our cab was awaiting us outside, and our programme was evidently prearranged, for the driver started off at once at a rapid pace. Thaddeus Sholto talked incessantly, in a voice which rose high above the rattle of the wheels. <div class="bookquote">``Bartholomew is a clever fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``How do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) found out where the treasure was? He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) had come to the conclusion that it was somewhere indoors: so he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) worked out all the cubic space of the house, and made measurements everywhere, so that not one inch should be unaccounted for. Among other things, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) found that the height of the building was seventy-four feet, but on adding together the heights of all the separate rooms, and making every allowance for the space between, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) ascertained by borings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) could not bring the total to more than seventy feet. There were four feet unaccounted for. These could only be at the top of the building. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) knocked a hole, therefore, in the lath-and-plaster ceiling of the highest room, and there, sure enough, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) came upon another little garret above it, which had been sealed up and was known to no one. In the centre stood the treasure-chest, resting upon two rafters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) lowered it through the hole, and there it lies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) computes the value of the jewels at not less than half a million sterling.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At the mention of this gigantic sum we all stared at one another open-eyed. Miss Morstan, could we secure her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) rights, would change from a needy governess to the richest heiress in England. Surely it was the place of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news; yet I am ashamed to say that selfishness took me by the soul, and that my heart turned as heavy as lead within me. I stammered out some few halting words of congratulation, and then sat downcast, with my head drooped, deaf to the babble of our new acquaintance. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was clearly a confirmed hypochondriac, and I was dreamily conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was pouring forth interminable trains of symptoms, and imploring information as to the composition and action of innumerable quack nostrums, some of which he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) bore about in a leather case in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) pocket. I trust that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) may not remember any of the answers which I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) that night. Holmes declares that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) overheard me caution him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) against the great danger of taking more than two drops of castor oil, while I recommended strychnine in large doses as a sedative. However that may be, I was certainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachman sprang down to open the door. <div class="bookquote">``This, Miss Morstan, is Pondicherry Lodge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thaddeus Sholto/Mr. Thaddeus/Mr. Thaddeus Sholto</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) out. Chapter V The Tragedy of Pondicherry Lodge It was nearly eleven o'clock when we reached this final stage of our night's adventures. We had left the damp fog of the great city behind us, and the night was fairly fine. A warm wind blew from the westward, and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky, with half a moon peeping occasionally through the rifts.
<p/>It was clear enough to see for some distance, but Thaddeus Sholto took down one of the side-lamps from the carriage to give us a better light upon our way. Pondicherry Lodge stood in its own grounds, and was girt round with a very high stone wall topped with broken glass. A single narrow iron-clamped door formed the only means of entrance. On this our guide knocked with a peculiar postman-like rat-tat. <div class="bookquote">``Who is there? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried a gruff voice from within. <div class="bookquote">``It is I, McMurdo. You surely know my knock by this time. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a grumbling sound and a clanking and jarring of keys. The door swung heavily back, and a short, deep-chested man stood in the opening, with the yellow light of the lantern shining upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) protruded face and twinkling distrustful eyes. <div class="bookquote">``That you, Mr. Thaddeus? But who are the others? I had no orders about them from the master.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, McMurdo? You surprise me! I told my brother last night that I should bring some friends.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ain't been out o' his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) room to-day, Mr. Thaddeus, and I have no orders. You know very well that I must stick to regulations. I can let you in, but your friends must just stop where they are. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This was an unexpected obstacle. Thaddeus Sholto looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) in a perplexed and helpless manner. <div class="bookquote">``This is too bad of you, McMurdo!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If I guarantee them, that is enough for you. There is the young lady, too.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus,''  (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div>said the porter, inexorably. <div class="bookquote">``Folk may be friends o' yours, and yet no friends o' the master's.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes you do, McMurdo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>cried Sherlock Holmes, genially. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think you can have forgotten me. Don't you remember the amateur who fought three rounds with you at Alison's rooms on the night of your benefit four years back?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not Mr. Sherlock Holmes!''  (<font color='red'><b>the prize-fighter</b></font>)</div>roared the prize-fighter. <div class="bookquote">``God's truth! how could I have mistook you?

Ah, you're one that has wasted your gifts, you have! You might have aimed high, if you had joined the fancy.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You see, Watson, if all else fails me I have still one of the scientific professions open to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Our friend won't keep us out in the cold now, I am sure.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``In you come, sir, in you come,--you and your friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) answered. '' Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus, but orders are very strict. Had to be certain of your friends before I let them in.'' Inside, a gravel path wound through desolate grounds to a huge clump of a house, square and prosaic, all plunged in shadow save where a moonbeam struck one corner and glimmered in a garret window. The vast size of the building, with its gloom and its deathly silence, struck a chill to the heart. Even Thaddeus Sholto seemed ill at ease, and the lantern quivered and rattled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot understand it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``There must be some mistake. I distinctly told Bartholomew that we should be here, and yet there is no light in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) window. I do not know what to make of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) always guard the premises in this way?''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>asked Holmes. ''
<p/>Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) has followed my father's custom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was the favorite son, you know, and I sometimes think that my father may have told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) more than he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ever told me. That is Bartholomew's window up there where the moonshine strikes. It is quite bright, but there is no light from within, I think.'' <div class="bookquote">``None,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. '' But I see the glint of a light in that little window beside the door.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, that is the housekeeper's room. That is where old Mrs. Bernstone sits. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstone</b></font>) can tell us all about it. But perhaps you would not mind waiting here for a minute or two, for if we all go in together and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstone</b></font>) has no word of our coming she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstone</b></font>) may be alarmed. But hush! what is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) held up the lantern, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) hand shook until the circles of light flickered and wavered all round us. Miss Morstan seized my wrist, and we all stood with thumping hearts, straining our ears. From the great black house there sounded through the silent night the saddest and most pitiful of sounds,--the shrill, broken whimpering of a frightened woman. <div class="bookquote">``It is Mrs. Bernstone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sholto/Mr. Sholto/Bartholomew</b></font>)</div>said Sholto. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstone</b></font>) is the only woman in the house. Wait here. I shall be back in a moment.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) hurried for the door, and knocked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) peculiar way. We could see a tall old woman admit him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>), and sway with pleasure at the very sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>). '' Oh, Mr. Thaddeus, sir, I am so glad you have come! I am so glad you have come, Mr. Thaddeus, sir!'' We heard her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reiterated rejoicings until the door was closed and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice died away into a muffled monotone. Our guide had left us the lantern.
<p/>Holmes swung it slowly round, and peered keenly at the house, and at the great rubbish-heaps which cumbered the grounds. Miss Morstan and I stood together, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand was in mine. A wondrous subtle thing is love, for here were we two who had never seen each other before that day, between whom no word or even look of affection had ever passed, and yet now in an hour of trouble our hands instinctively sought for each other. I have marvelled at it since, but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that I should go out to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) so, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has often told me, there was in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) also the instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection. So we stood hand in hand, like two children, and there was peace in our hearts for all the dark things that surrounded us. '' What a strange place! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, looking round. <div class="bookquote">``It looks as though all the moles in England had been let loose in it. I have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill near Ballarat, where the prospectors had been at work.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And from the same cause,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``These are the traces of the treasure-seekers. You must remember that they were six years looking for it. No wonder that the grounds look like a gravel-pit.''  (<font color='red'><b>Thaddeus Sholto/Mr. Thaddeus/Mr. Thaddeus Sholto</b></font>)</div>At that moment the door of the house burst open, and Thaddeus Sholto came running out, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) hands thrown forward and terror in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``There is something amiss with Bartholomew!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I am frightened! My nerves cannot stand it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) was, indeed, half blubbering with fear, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) twitching feeble face peeping out from the great Astrakhan collar had the helpless appealing expression of a terrified child. '' Come into the house,'' said Holmes, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) crisp, firm way. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, do! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Thaddeus Sholto/Mr. Thaddeus/Mr. Thaddeus Sholto</b></font>)</div>pleaded Thaddeus Sholto. <div class="bookquote">``I really do not feel equal to giving directions. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>We all followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) into the housekeeper's room, which stood upon the left-hand side of the passage. The old woman was pacing up and down with a scared look and restless picking fingers, but the sight of Miss Morstan appeared to have a soothing effect upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). '' God bless your sweet calm face!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried, with an hysterical sob. <div class="bookquote">``It does me good to see you. Oh, but I have been sorely tried this day! ''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>Our companion patted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thin, work-worn hand, and murmured some few words of kindly womanly comfort which brought the color back into the others bloodless cheeks. <div class="bookquote">``Master has locked himself in and will not answer me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) explained. <div class="bookquote">``All day I have waited to hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) often likes to be alone; but an hour ago I feared that something was amiss, so I went up and peeped through the key-hole. You must go up, Mr. Thaddeus,--you must go up and look for yourself. I have seen Mr. Bartholomew Sholto in joy and in sorrow for ten long years, but I never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) with such a face on him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) as that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>Sherlock Holmes took the lamp and led the way, for Thaddeus Sholto's teeth were chattering in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) head. So shaken was he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) that I had to pass my hand under his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) arm as we went up the stairs, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) knees were trembling under him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>).
<p/>Twice as we ascended Holmes whipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) lens out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to me to be mere shapeless smudges of dust upon the cocoa-nut matting which served as a stair-carpet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) walked slowly from step to step, holding the lamp, and shooting keen glances to right and left. Miss Morstan had remained behind with the frightened housekeeper. The third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length, with a great picture in Indian tapestry upon the right of it and three doors upon the left. Holmes advanced along it in the same slow and methodical way, while we kept close at his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) heels, with our long black shadows streaming backwards down the corridor. The third door was that which we were seeking. Holmes knocked without receiving any answer, and then tried to turn the handle and force it open. It was locked on the inside, however, and by a broad and powerful bolt, as we could see when we set our lamp up against it. The key being turned, however, the hole was not entirely closed. Sherlock Holmes bent down to it, and instantly rose again with a sharp intaking of the breath. <div class="bookquote">``There is something devilish in this, Watson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>), more moved than I had ever before seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What do you make of it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stooped to the hole, and recoiled in horror. Moonlight was streaming into the room, and it was bright with a vague and shifty radiance. Looking straight at me, and suspended, as it were, in the air, for all beneath was in shadow, there hung a face,--the very face of our companion Thaddeus. There was the same high, shining head, the same circular bristle of red hair, the same bloodless countenance.
<p/>The features were set, however, in a horrible smile, a fixed and unnatural grin, which in that still and moonlit room was more jarring to the nerves than any scowl or contortion. So like was the face to that of our little friend that I looked round at him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to make sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was indeed with us. Then I recalled to mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had mentioned to us that his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) brother and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) were twins. <div class="bookquote">``This is terrible!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said to Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``What is to be done?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The door must come down,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) answered, and, springing against it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) put all his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) weight upon the lock. It creaked and groaned, but did not yield. Together we flung ourselves upon it once more, and this time it gave way with a sudden snap, and we found ourselves within Bartholomew Sholto's chamber. It appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory. A double line of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the door, and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners, test-tubes, and retorts. In the corners stood carboys of acid in wicker baskets. One of these appeared to leak or to have been broken, for a stream of dark-colored liquid had trickled out from it, and the air was heavy with a peculiarly pungent, tar-like odor. A set of steps stood at one side of the room, in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster, and above them there was an opening in the ceiling large enough for a man to pass through. At the foot of the steps a long coil of rope was thrown carelessly together.
<p/>By the table, in a wooden arm-chair, the master of the house was seated all in a heap, with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) head sunk upon his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) left shoulder, and that ghastly, inscrutable smile upon his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was stiff and cold, and had clearly been dead many hours. It seemed to me that not only his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) features but all his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) limbs were twisted and turned in the most fantastic fashion. By his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) hand upon the table there lay a peculiar instrument,--a brown, close-grained stick, with a stone head like a hammer, rudely lashed on with coarse twine. Beside it was a torn sheet of note-paper with some words scrawled upon it. Holmes glanced at it, and then handed it to me. <div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said, with a significant raising of the eyebrows. In the light of the lantern I read, with a thrill of horror, <div class="bookquote">``The sign of the four.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``In God's name, what does it all mean? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">``It means murder,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), stooping over the dead man. '' Ah, I expected it. Look here!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pointed to what looked like a long, dark thorn stuck in the skin just above the ear. <div class="bookquote">``It looks like a thorn,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``It is a thorn. You may pick it out. But be careful, for it is poisoned. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>I took it up between my finger and thumb. It came away from the skin so readily that hardly any mark was left behind. One tiny speck of blood showed where the puncture had been. <div class="bookquote">``This is all an insoluble mystery to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``It grows darker instead of clearer.''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I.</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``it clears every instant. I only require a few missing links to have an entirely connected case.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>We had almost forgotten our companion's presence since we entered the chamber. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was still standing in the door-way, the very picture of terror, wringing his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) hands and moaning to himself. Suddenly, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) broke out into a sharp, querulous cry. <div class="bookquote">``The treasure is gone!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``They have robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) of the treasure! There is the hole through which we lowered it. I helped him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) to do it! I was the last person who saw him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)! I left him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) here last night, and I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) lock the door as I came down-stairs.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What time was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was ten o'clock. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) is dead, and the police will be called in, and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it. Oh, yes, I am sure I shall. But you don't think so, gentlemen? Surely you don't think that it was I? Is it likely that I would have brought you here if it were I? Oh, dear! oh, dear! I know that I shall go mad!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) jerked his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) arms and stamped his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy. <div class="bookquote">``You have no reason for fear, Mr. Sholto,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, kindly, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``Take my advice, and drive down to the station to report this matter to the police. Offer to assist them in every way. We shall wait here until your return. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion, and we heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stumbling down the stairs in the dark. Chapter VI Sherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration '' Now, Watson,'' said Holmes, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) hands, <div class="bookquote">``we have half an hour to ourselves. Let us make good use of it.
<p/>My case is, as I have told you, almost complete; but we must not err on the side of over-confidence. Simple as the case seems now, there may be something deeper underlying it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Simple!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I ejaculated. '' Surely,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), with something of the air of a clinical professor expounding to his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) class. <div class="bookquote">``Just sit in the corner there, that your footprints may not complicate matters. Now to work! In the first place, how did these folk come, and how did they go? The door has not been opened since last night. How of the window?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) carried the lamp across to it, muttering his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) observations aloud the while, but addressing them to himself rather than to me. <div class="bookquote">``Window is snibbed on the inner side. Framework is solid. No hinges at the side. Let us open it. No water-pipe near. Roof quite out of reach. Yet a man has mounted by the window. It rained a little last night. Here is the print of a foot in mould upon the sill. And here is a circular muddy mark, and here again upon the floor, and here again by the table. See here, Watson! This is really a very pretty demonstration. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked at the round, well-defined muddy discs. <div class="bookquote">``This is not a footmark,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``It is something much more valuable to us. It is the impression of a wooden stump. You see here on the sill is the boot-mark, a heavy boot with the broad metal heel, and beside it is the mark of the timber-toe.''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is the wooden-legged man.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Quite so. But there has been some one else,--a very able and efficient ally. Could you scale that wall, doctor? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked out of the open window.
<p/>The moon still shone brightly on that angle of the house. We were a good sixty feet from the ground, and, look where I would, I could see no foothold, nor as much as a crevice in the brick-work. <div class="bookquote">``It is absolutely impossible,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. <div class="bookquote">``Without aid it is so. But suppose you had a friend up here who lowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner, securing one end of it to this great hook in the wall. Then, I think, if you were an active man, You might swarm up, wooden leg and all. You would depart, of course, in the same fashion, and your ally would draw up the rope, untie it from the hook, shut the window, snib it on the inside, and get away in the way that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) originally came. As a minor point it may be noted,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued, fingering the rope, <div class="bookquote">``that our wooden-legged friend, though a fair climber, was not a professional sailor. His (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) hands were far from horny. My lens discloses more than one blood-mark, especially towards the end of the rope, from which I gather that he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) slipped down with such velocity that he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) took the skin off his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) hand.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This is all very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``but the thing becomes more unintelligible than ever. How about this mysterious ally? How came he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) into the room?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, the ally!''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>repeated Holmes, pensively. <div class="bookquote">``There are features of interest about this ally. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) lifts the case from the regions of the commonplace. I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals of crime in this country,--though parallel cases suggest themselves from India, and, if my memory serves me, from Senegambia.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How came he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), then?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I reiterated. <div class="bookquote">``The door is locked, the window is inaccessible.
<p/>Was it through the chimney?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The grate is much too small,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I had already considered that possibility.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How then? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I persisted. <div class="bookquote">``You will not apply my precept,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, must be the truth? We know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) did not come through the door, the window, or the chimney. We also know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) could not have been concealed in the room, as there is no concealment possible. Whence, then, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) come?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) came through the hole in the roof,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried. <div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) did. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) must have done so. If you will have the kindness to hold the lamp for me, we shall now extend our researches to the room above,--the secret room in which the treasure was found.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) mounted the steps, and, seizing a rafter with either hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) swung himself up into the garret. Then, lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) reached down for the lamp and held it while I followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). The chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one way and six the other. The floor was formed by the rafters, with thin lath-and-plaster between, so that in walking one had to step from beam to beam. The roof ran up to an apex, and was evidently the inner shell of the true roof of the house. There was no furniture of any sort, and the accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor. <div class="bookquote">``Here you are, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Sherlock Holmes, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) hand against the sloping wall. <div class="bookquote">``This is a trap-door which leads out on to the roof.
<p/>I can press it back, and here is the roof itself, sloping at a gentle angle. This, then, is the way by which Number One entered. Let us see if we can find any other traces of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) individuality.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) held down the lamp to the floor, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) did so I saw for the second time that night a startled, surprised look come over his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) face. For myself, as I followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) gaze my skin was cold under my clothes. The floor was covered thickly with the prints of a naked foot,--clear, well defined, perfectly formed, but scarce half the size of those of an ordinary man. '' Holmes,'' I said, in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``a child has done the horrid thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) had recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) self-possession in an instant. <div class="bookquote">``I was staggered for the moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but the thing is quite natural. My memory failed me, or I should have been able to foretell it. There is nothing more to be learned here. Let us go down.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What is your theory, then, as to those footmarks? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, eagerly, when we had regained the lower room once more. '' My dear Watson, try a little analysis yourself,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>), with a touch of impatience. <div class="bookquote">``You know my methods. Apply them, and it will be instructive to compare results.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I cannot conceive anything which will cover the facts,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. <div class="bookquote">``It will be clear enough to you soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) said, in an off-hand way. <div class="bookquote">``I think that there is nothing else of importance here, but I will look.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) whipped out his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) lens and a tape measure, and hurried about the room on his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) knees, measuring, comparing, examining, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) long thin nose only a few inches from the planks, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) beady eyes gleaming and deep-set like those of a bird. So swift, silent, and furtive were his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) movements, like those of a trained blood-hound picking out a scent, that I could not but think what a terrible criminal he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) would have made had he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) energy and sagacity against the law, instead of exerting them in its defense. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) hunted about, he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) kept muttering to himself, and finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) broke out into a loud crow of delight. <div class="bookquote">``We are certainly in luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We ought to have very little trouble now. Number One has had the misfortune to tread in the creosote. You can see the outline of the edge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) small foot here at the side of this evil-smelling mess. The carboy has been cracked, You see, and the stuff has leaked out. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What then?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">``Why, we have got him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>), that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I know a dog that would follow that scent to the world's end. If a pack can track a trailed herring across a shire, how far can a specially-trained hound follow so pungent a smell as this? It sounds like a sum in the rule of three. The answer should give us the--But halloo! here are the accredited representatives of the law.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Heavy steps and the clamor of loud voices were audible from below, and the hall door shut with a loud crash. '' Before they come,'' said Holmes, <div class="bookquote">``just put your hand here on this poor fellow's arm, and here on his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) leg. What do you feel?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The muscles are as hard as a board,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. '' Quite so. They are in a state of extreme contraction, far exceeding the usual rigor mortis. Coupled with this distortion of the face, this Hippocratic smile, or `risus sardonicus,' as the old writers called it, what conclusion would it suggest to your mind?'' <div class="bookquote">``Death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered,--<div class="bookquote">``some strychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawn muscles of the face. On getting into the room I at once looked for the means by which the poison had entered the system. As you saw, I discovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force into the scalp. You observe that the part struck was that which would be turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair. Now examine the thorn. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern. It was long, sharp, and black, with a glazed look near the point as though some gummy substance had dried upon it. The blunt end had been trimmed and rounded off with a knife. <div class="bookquote">``Is that an English thorn?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``No, it certainly is not.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``With all these data you should be able to draw some just inference. But here are the regulars: so the auxiliary forces may beat a retreat.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke, the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on the passage, and a very stout, portly man in a gray suit strode heavily into the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was red-faced, burly and plethoric, with a pair of very small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from between swollen and puffy pouches.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was closely followed by an inspector in uniform, and by the still palpitating Thaddeus Sholto. <div class="bookquote">``Here's a business!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) cried, in a muffled, husky voice. <div class="bookquote">``Here's a pretty business! But who are all these? Why, the house seems to be as full as a rabbit-warren!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think you must recollect me, Mr. Athelney Jones,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Why, of course I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) wheezed. <div class="bookquote">``It's Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the theorist. Remember you! I'll never forget how you lectured us all on causes and inferences and effects in the Bishopgate jewel case. It's true you set us on the right track; but you'll own now that it was more by good luck than good guidance.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was a piece of very simple reasoning.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come, now, come! Never be ashamed to own up. But what is all this? Bad business! Bad business! Stern facts here,--no room for theories. How lucky that I happened to be out at Norwood over another case! I was at the station when the message arrived. What d'you think the man died of?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, this is hardly a case for me to theorize over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, dryly. '' No, no. Still, we can't deny that you hit the nail on the head sometimes. Dear me! Door locked, I understand. Jewels worth half a million missing. How was the window?'' <div class="bookquote">``Fastened; but there are steps on the sill.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do with the matter. That's common sense. Man might have died in a fit; but then the jewels are missing. Ha! I have a theory. These flashes come upon me at times.--Just step outside, sergeant, and you, Mr. Sholto. Your friend can remain.--What do you think of this, Holmes?
<p/>Sholto was, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) own confession, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) brother last night. The brother died in a fit, on which Sholto walked off with the treasure. How's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``On which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on the inside.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hum! There's a flaw there. Let us apply common sense to the matter. This Thaddeus Sholto WAS with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) brother ; there WAS a quarrel; so much we know. The brother is dead and the jewels are gone. So much also we know. No one saw the brother from the time Thaddeus left him (<font color='blue'><b>Thaddeus</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Thaddeus</b></font>) bed had not been slept in. Thaddeus is evidently in a most disturbed state of mind. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thaddeus</b></font>) appearance is--well, not attractive. You see that I am weaving my web round Thaddeus. The net begins to close upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Thaddeus</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are not quite in possession of the facts yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. '' This splinter of wood, which I have every reason to believe to be poisoned, was in the man's scalp where you still see the mark; this card, inscribed as you see it, was on the table; and beside it lay this rather curious stone-headed instrument. How does all that fit into your theory?'' <div class="bookquote">``Confirms it in every respect,''  (<font color='red'><b>the detective</b></font>)</div>said the fat detective, pompously. <div class="bookquote">``House is full of Indian curiosities. Thaddeus brought this up, and if this splinter be poisonous Thaddeus may as well have made murderous use of it as any other man. The card is some hocus-pocus,--a blind, as like as not. The only question is, how did he (<font color='blue'><b>Thaddeus</b></font>) depart? Ah, of course, here is a hole in the roof.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With great activity, considering his (<font color='blue'><b>Thaddeus</b></font>) bulk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thaddeus</b></font>) sprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret, and immediately afterwards we heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Thaddeus</b></font>) exulting voice proclaiming that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thaddeus</b></font>) had found the trap-door. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Thaddeus</b></font>) can find something,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>remarked Holmes, shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) shoulders. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) has occasional glimmerings of reason. Il n'y a pas des sots si incommodes que ceux qui ont de l'esprit! '' <div class="bookquote">``You see!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jones/Athelney Jones/Mr. Athelney Jones</b></font>)</div>said Athelney Jones, reappearing down the steps again. <div class="bookquote">``Facts are better than mere theories, after all. My view of the case is confirmed. There is a trap-door communicating with the roof, and it is partly open.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was I who opened it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed! You did notice it, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) seemed a little crestfallen at the discovery. '' Well, whoever noticed it, it shows how our gentleman got away. Inspector!'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>from the passage. '' Ask Mr. Sholto to step this way.--Mr. Sholto, it is my duty to inform you that anything which you may say will be used against you. I arrest you in the queen's name as being concerned in the death of your brother.'' <div class="bookquote">``There, now! Didn't I tell you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the poor little man, throwing out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, and looking from one to the other of us. '' Don't trouble yourself about it, Mr. Sholto,'' said Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``I think that I can engage to clear you of the charge.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't promise too much, Mr. Theorist,--don't promise too much!''  (<font color='red'><b>the detective</b></font>)</div>snapped the detective. <div class="bookquote">``You may find it a harder matter than you think.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not only will I clear him (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>), Mr. Jones, but I will make you a free present of the name and description of one of the two people who were in this room last night. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) name, I have every reason to believe, is Jonathan Small.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) is a poorly-educated man, small, active, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) right leg off, and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the inner side. His (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) left boot has a coarse, square-toed sole, with an iron band round the heel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) is a middle-aged man, much sunburned, and has been a convict. These few indications may be of some assistance to you, coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing from the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) hand. The other man--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah! the other man--?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jones/Athelney Jones/Mr. Athelney Jones</b></font>)</div>asked Athelney Jones, in a sneering voice, but impressed none the less, as I could easily see, by the precision of the other's manner. <div class="bookquote">``Is a rather curious person,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Sherlock Holmes, turning upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) heel. <div class="bookquote">``I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair of them.--A word with you, Watson.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) led me out to the head of the stair. <div class="bookquote">``This unexpected occurrence,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of our journey.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have just been thinking so,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. <div class="bookquote">``It is not right that Miss Morstan should remain in this stricken house.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. You must escort her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) home. She (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) lives with Mrs. Cecil Forrester, in Lower Camberwell: so it is not very far. I will wait for you here if you will drive out again. Or perhaps you are too tired?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``By no means. I don't think I could rest until I know more of this fantastic business. I have seen something of the rough side of life, but I give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprises to-night has shaken my nerve completely. I should like, however, to see the matter through with you, now that I have got so far.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your presence will be of great service to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``We shall work the case out independently, and leave this fellow Jones to exult over any mare's-nest which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) may choose to construct. When you have dropped Miss Morstan I wish you to go on to No. 3 Pinchin Lane, down near the water's edge at Lambeth. The third house on the right-hand side is a bird-stuffer's: Sherman is the name. You will see a weasel holding a young rabbit in the window. Knock old Sherman up, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Sherman</b></font>), with my compliments, that I want Toby at once. You will bring Toby back in the cab with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A dog, I suppose.''  (<font color='red'><b>queer</b></font>)</div>'' Yes,--a queer mongrel, with a most amazing power of scent. I would rather have Toby's help than that of the whole detective force of London.'' <div class="bookquote">``I shall bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>), then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``It is one now. I ought to be back before three, if I can get a fresh horse.''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>'' And I,'' said Holmes, <div class="bookquote">``shall see what I can learn from Mrs. Bernstone, and from the Indian servant, who, Mr. Thaddeus tell me, sleeps in the next garret. Then I shall study the great Jones's methods and listen to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) not too delicate sarcasms. ' Wir sind gewohnt das die Menschen verhoehnen was sie nicht verstehen.' Goethe is always pithy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>Chapter VII The Episode of the Barrel The police had brought a cab with them, and in this I escorted Miss Morstan back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstone</b></font>) home. After the angelic fashion of women, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstone</b></font>) had borne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weaker than herself to support, and I had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstone</b></font>) bright and placid by the side of the frightened housekeeper.
<p/>In the cab, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstone</b></font>) first turned faint, and then burst into a passion of weeping,--so sorely had she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstone</b></font>) been tried by the adventures of the night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstone</b></font>) has told me since that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstone</b></font>) thought me cold and distant upon that journey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstone</b></font>) little guessed the struggle within my breast, or the effort of self-restraint which held me back. My sympathies and my love went out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstone</b></font>), even as my hand had in the garden. I felt that years of the conventionalities of life could not teach me to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstone</b></font>) sweet, brave nature as had this one day of strange experiences. Yet there were two thoughts which sealed the words of affection upon my lips. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstone</b></font>) was weak and helpless, shaken in mind and nerve. It was to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstone</b></font>) at a disadvantage to obtrude love upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstone</b></font>) at such a time. Worse still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstone</b></font>) was rich. If Holmes's researches were successful, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstone</b></font>) would be an heiress. Was it fair , was it honorable, that a half-pay surgeon should take such advantage of an intimacy which chance had brought about? Might she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstone</b></font>) not look upon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker? I could not bear to risk that such a thought should cross her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstone</b></font>) mind. This Agra treasure intervened like an impassable barrier between us. It was nearly two o'clock when we reached Mrs. Cecil Forrester's. The servants had retired hours ago, but Mrs. Forrester had been so interested by the strange message which Miss Morstan had received that she (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) had sat up in the hope of her (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) return. She (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) opened the door herself, a middle-aged, graceful woman, and it gave me joy to see how tenderly her (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) arm stole round the other's waist and how motherly was the voice in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) was clearly no mere paid dependant, but an honored friend. I was introduced, and Mrs. Forrester earnestly begged me to step in and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) our adventures. I explained, however, the importance of my errand, and promised faithfully to call and report any progress which we might make with the case. As we drove away I stole a glance back, and I still seem to see that little group on the step, the two graceful, clinging figures, the half-opened door, the hall light shining through stained glass, the barometer, and the bright stair-rods. It was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of a tranquil English home in the midst of the wild, dark business which had absorbed us. And the more I thought of what had happened, the wilder and darker it grew. I reviewed the whole extraordinary sequence of events as I rattled on through the silent gas-lit streets. There was the original problem: that at least was pretty clear now. The death of Captain Morstan, the sending of the pearls, the advertisement, the letter,--we had had light upon all those events. They had only led us, however, to a deeper and far more tragic mystery. The Indian treasure, the curious plan found among Morstan's baggage, the strange scene at Major Sholto's death, the rediscovery of the treasure immediately followed by the murder of the discoverer, the very singular accompaniments to the crime, the footsteps, the remarkable weapons, the words upon the card, corresponding with those upon Captain Morstan's chart,--here was indeed a labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than my fellow-lodger might well despair of ever finding the clue. Pinchin Lane was a row of shabby two-storied brick houses in the lower quarter of Lambeth.
<p/>I had to knock for some time at No. 3 before I could make my impression. At last, however, there was the glint of a candle behind the blind, and a face looked out at the upper window. <div class="bookquote">``Go on, you drunken vagabone,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the face. <div class="bookquote">``If you kick up any more row I'll open the kennels and let out forty-three dogs upon you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If you'll let one out it's just what I have come for,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Go on!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>yelled the voice. '' So help me gracious , I have a wiper in the bag, an' I'll drop it on your `ead if you don't hook it.'' <div class="bookquote">``But I want a dog,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried. <div class="bookquote">``I won't be argued with!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sherman/Sherman</b></font>)</div>shouted Mr. Sherman. <div class="bookquote">``Now stand clear, for when I say `three,' down goes the wiper.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Sherlock Holmes--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I began, but the words had a most magical effect, for the window instantly slammed down, and within a minute the door was unbarred and open. Mr. Sherman was a lanky, lean old man, with stooping shoulders, a stringy neck, and blue-tinted glasses. <div class="bookquote">``A friend of Mr. Sherlock is always welcome,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sherlock</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Step in, sir. Keep clear of the badger; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sherlock</b></font>) bites. Ah, naughty, naughty, would you take a nip at the gentleman?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This to a stoat which thrust its wicked head and red eyes between the bars of its cage. <div class="bookquote">``Don't mind that, sir: it's only a slow-worm. It hain't got no fangs, so I gives it the run o' the room, for it keeps the beetles down. You must not mind my bein' just a little short wi' you at first, for I'm guyed at by the children, and there's many a one just comes down this lane to knock me up.
<p/>What was it that Mr. Sherlock Holmes wanted, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) wanted a dog of yours.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah! that would be Toby.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Toby was the name.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Toby lives at No. 7 on the left here.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) moved slowly forward with his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) candle among the queer animal family which he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) had gathered round him (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>). In the uncertain, shadowy light I could see dimly that there were glancing, glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every cranny and corner. Even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn fowls, who lazily shifted their weight from one leg to the other as our voices disturbed their slumbers. Toby proved to be an ugly, long-haired, lop-eared creature, half spaniel and half lurcher, brown-and-white in color, with a very clumsy waddling gait. It accepted after some hesitation a lump of sugar which the old naturalist handed to me, and, having thus sealed an alliance, it followed me to the cab, and made no difficulties about accompanying me. It had just struck three on the Palace clock when I found myself back once more at Pondicherry Lodge. The ex-prize-fighter McMurdo had, I found, been arrested as an accessory, and both he (<font color='blue'><b>naturalist</b></font>) and Mr. Sholto had been marched off to the station. Two constables guarded the narrow gate, but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my mentioning the detective's name. Holmes was standing on the door-step, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) pockets, smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) pipe. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, you have him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) there!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Good dog, then! Atheney Jones has gone. We have had an immense display of energy since you left. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) has arrested not only friend Thaddeus, but the gatekeeper, the housekeeper, and the Indian servant. We have the place to ourselves, but for a sergeant up-stairs. Leave the dog here, and come up.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Toby</b></font>)</div>We tied Toby to the hall table, and reascended the stairs. The room was as he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) had left it, save that a sheet had been draped over the central figure. A weary-looking police-sergeant reclined in the corner. '' Lend me your bull's-eye, sergeant,'' said my companion. <div class="bookquote">``Now tie this bit of card round my neck, so as to hang it in front of me. Thank you. Now I must kick off my boots and stockings.--Just you carry them down with you, Watson. I am going to do a little climbing. And dip my handkerchief into the creasote. That will do. Now come up into the garret with me for a moment. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We clambered up through the hole. Holmes turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) light once more upon the footsteps in the dust. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you particularly to notice these footmarks,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Do you observe anything noteworthy about them?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They belong,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``to a child or a small woman.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Apart from their size, though. Is there nothing else?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They appear to be much as other footmarks.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. Look here! This is the print of a right foot in the dust. Now I make one with my naked foot beside it. What is the chief difference?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your toes are all cramped together. The other print has each toe distinctly divided.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Quite so. That is the point. Bear that in mind. Now, would you kindly step over to that flap-window and smell the edge of the wood-work? I shall stay here, as I have this handkerchief in my hand. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I did as he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) directed, and was instantly conscious of a strong tarry smell. <div class="bookquote">``That is where he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) foot in getting out. If YOU can trace him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>), I should think that Toby will have no difficulty.
<p/>Now run down-stairs, loose the dog, and look out for Blondin. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>By the time that I got out into the grounds Sherlock Holmes was on the roof, and I could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) like an enormous glow-worm crawling very slowly along the ridge. I lost sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) behind a stack of chimneys, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) presently reappeared, and then vanished once more upon the opposite side. When I made my way round there I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) seated at one of the corner eaves. <div class="bookquote">``That you, Watson? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This is the place. What is that black thing down there?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A water-barrel.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Top on it?''

''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a scuffling of feet, and the lantern began to come steadily down the side of the wall. Then with a light spring he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) came on to the barrel, and from there to the earth. <div class="bookquote">``It was easy to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said, drawing on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) stockings and boots. <div class="bookquote">``Tiles were loosened the whole way along, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hurry he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had dropped this. It confirms my diagnosis, as you doctors express it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The object which he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) held up to me was a small pocket or pouch woven out of colored grasses and with a few tawdry beads strung round it. In shape and size it was not unlike a cigarette-case. Inside were half a dozen spines of dark wood, sharp at one end and rounded at the other, like that which had struck Bartholomew Sholto. <div class="bookquote">``They are hellish things,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Look out that you don't prick yourself.
<p/>I'm delighted to have them, for the chances are that they are all he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) has. There is the less fear of you or me finding one in our skin before long. I would sooner face a Martini bullet, myself. Are you game for a six-mile trudge, Watson?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. <div class="bookquote">``Your leg will stand it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Here you are, doggy! Good old Toby! Smell it, Toby, smell it!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) pushed the creasote handkerchief under the dog's nose, while the creature stood with its fluffy legs separated, and with a most comical cock to its head, like a connoisseur sniffing the bouquet of a famous vintage. Holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance, fastened a stout cord to the mongrel's collar, and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) to the foot of the water-barrel. The creature instantly broke into a succession of high, tremulous yelps, and, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) nose on the ground, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) tail in the air, pattered off upon the trail at a pace which strained his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) leash and kept us at the top of our speed. The east had been gradually whitening, and we could now see some distance in the cold gray light. The square, massive house, with its black, empty windows and high, bare walls, towered up, sad and forlorn, behind us. Our course led right across the grounds, in and out among the trenches and pits with which they were scarred and intersected. The whole place, with its scattered dirt-heaps and ill-grown shrubs, had a blighted, ill-omened look which harmonized with the black tragedy which hung over it. On reaching the boundary wall Toby ran along, whining eagerly, underneath its shadow, and stopped finally in a corner screened by a young beech.
<p/>Where the two walls joined, several bricks had been loosened, and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon the lower side, as though they had frequently been used as a ladder. Holmes clambered up, and, taking the dog from me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) dropped it over upon the other side. <div class="bookquote">``There's the print of wooden-leg's hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) remarked, as I mounted up beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You see the slight smudge of blood upon the white plaster. What a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rain since yesterday! The scent will lie upon the road in spite of their eight-and-twenty hours' start. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I confess that I had my doubts myself when I reflected upon the great traffic which had passed along the London road in the interval. My fears were soon appeased, however. Toby never hesitated or swerved, but waddled on in his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) peculiar rolling fashion. Clearly, the pungent smell of the creasote rose high above all other contending scents. <div class="bookquote">``Do not imagine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, <div class="bookquote">``that I depend for my success in this case upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) foot in the chemical. I have knowledge now which would enable me to trace them in many different ways. This, however, is the readiest and, since fortune has put it into our hands, I should be culpable if I neglected it. It has, however, prevented the case from becoming the pretty little intellectual problem which it at one time promised to be. There might have been some credit to be gained out of it, but for this too palpable clue.''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There is credit, and to spare,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you, Holmes, that I marvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case, even more than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder. The thing seems to me to be deeper and more inexplicable. How, for example, could you describe with such confidence the wooden-legged man?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pshaw, my dear boy! it was simplicity itself. I don't wish to be theatrical. It is all patent and above-board. Two officers who are in command of a convict-guard learn an important secret as to buried treasure. A map is drawn for them by an Englishman named Jonathan Small. You remember that we saw the name upon the chart in Captain Morstan's possession. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had signed it in behalf of himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) associates,--the sign of the four, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) somewhat dramatically called it. Aided by this chart, the officers--or one of them--gets the treasure and brings it to England, leaving, we will suppose, some condition under which he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) received it unfulfilled. Now, then, why did not Jonathan Small get the treasure himself? The answer is obvious. The chart is dated at a time when Morstan was brought into close association with convicts. Jonathan Small did not get the treasure because he (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) associates were themselves convicts and could not get away.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But that is mere speculation,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``It is more than that. It is the only hypothesis which covers the facts. Let us see how it fits in with the sequel. Major Sholto remains at peace for some years, happy in the possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) treasure. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) receives a letter from India which gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) a great fright. What was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A letter to say that the men whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) had wronged had been set free.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Or had escaped.
<p/>That is much more likely, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) would have known what their term of imprisonment was. It would not have been a surprise to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>). What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) do then? He (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) guards himself against a wooden-legged man,--a white man, mark you, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mistakes a white tradesman for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and actually fires a pistol at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Now, only one white man's name is on the chart. The others are Hindoos or Mohammedans. There is no other white man. Therefore we may say with confidence that the wooden-legged man is identical with Jonathan Small. Does the reasoning strike you as being faulty?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No: it is clear and concise.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, now, let us put ourselves in the place of Jonathan Small. Let us look at it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) point of view. He (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) comes to England with the double idea of regaining what he (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) would consider to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) rights and of having his (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) revenge upon the man who had wronged him (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) found out where Sholto lived, and very possibly he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) established communications with some one inside the house. There is this butler, Lal Rao, whom we have not seen. Mrs. Bernstone gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Rao</b></font>) far from a good character. Small could not find out, however, where the treasure was hid, for no one ever knew, save the major and one faithful servant who had died. Suddenly Small learns that the major is on his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) death-bed. In a frenzy lest the secret of the treasure die with him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) runs the gauntlet of the guards, makes his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) way to the dying man's window, and is only deterred from entering by the presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) two sons.
<p/>Mad with hate, however, against the dead man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enters the room that night, searches his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) private papers in the hope of discovering some memorandum relating to the treasure, and finally leaves a momento of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) visit in the short inscription upon the card. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had doubtless planned beforehand that should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slay the major he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it was not a common murder, but, from the point of view of the four associates, something in the nature of an act of justice. Whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are common enough in the annals of crime, and usually afford valuable indications as to the criminal. Do you follow all this?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very clearly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now, what could Jonathan Small do? He (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) could only continue to keep a secret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure. Possibly he (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) leaves England and only comes back at intervals. Then comes the discovery of the garret, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) is instantly informed of it. We again trace the presence of some confederate in the household. Jonathan, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) wooden leg, is utterly unable to reach the lofty room of Bartholomew Sholto. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) takes with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>), however, a rather curious associate, who gets over this difficulty, but dips his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) naked foot into creasote, whence comes Toby, and a six-mile limp for a half-pay officer with a damaged tendo Achillis.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But it was the associate, and not Jonathan, who committed the crime.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Quite so. And rather to Jonathan's disgust, to judge by the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) stamped about when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) got into the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) bore no grudge against Bartholomew Sholto, and would have preferred if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) could have been simply bound and gagged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) did not wish to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) head in a halter.
<p/>There was no help for it, however: the savage instincts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) companion had broken out, and the poison had done its work: so Jonathan Small left his (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) record, lowered the treasure-box to the ground, and followed it himself. That was the train of events as far as I can decipher them. Of course as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) personal appearance he (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) must be middle-aged, and must be sunburned after serving his (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) time in such an oven as the Andamans. His (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) height is readily calculated from the length of his (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) stride, and we know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) was bearded. His (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) hairiness was the one point which impressed itself upon Thaddeus Sholto when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) at the window. I don't know that there is anything else.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The associate?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well, there is no great mystery in that. But you will know all about it soon enough. How sweet the morning air is! See how that one little cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo. Now the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the London cloud-bank. It shines on a good many folk, but on none, I dare bet, who are on a stranger errand than you and I. How small we feel with our petty ambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces of nature! Are you well up in your Jean Paul?''

It is that the chief proof of man's real greatness lies in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) perception of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own smallness. It argues, you see, a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself a proof of nobility. There is much food for thought in Richter.
<p/>You have not a pistol, have you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have my stick.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is just possible that we may need something of the sort if we get to their lair. Jonathan I shall leave to you, but if the other turns nasty I shall shoot him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) dead.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) revolver as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) spoke, and, having loaded two of the chambers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) put it back into the right-hand pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) jacket. We had during this time been following the guidance of Toby down the half-rural villa-lined roads which lead to the metropolis. Now, however, we were beginning to come among continuous streets, where laborers and dockmen were already astir, and slatternly women were taking down shutters and brushing door-steps. At the square-topped corner public houses business was just beginning, and rough-looking men were emerging, rubbing their sleeves across their beards after their morning wet. Strange dogs sauntered up and stared wonderingly at us as we passed, but our inimitable Toby looked neither to the right nor to the left, but trotted onwards with his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) nose to the ground and an occasional eager whine which spoke of a hot scent. We had traversed Streatham, Brixton, Camberwell, and now found ourselves in Kennington Lane, having borne away through the side-streets to the east of the Oval. The men whom we pursued seemed to have taken a curiously zigzag road, with the idea probably of escaping observation. They had never kept to the main road if a parallel side-street would serve their turn. At the foot of Kennington Lane they had edged away to the left through Bond Street and Miles Street.
<p/>Where the latter street turns into Knight's Place, Toby ceased to advance, but began to run backwards and forwards with one ear cocked and the other drooping, the very picture of canine indecision. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) waddled round in circles, looking up to us from time to time, as if to ask for sympathy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) embarrassment. <div class="bookquote">``What the deuce is the matter with the dog? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>growled Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``They surely would not take a cab, or go off in a balloon.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps they stood here for some time,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I suggested. '' Ah! it's all right. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)'s off again,'' said my companion, in a tone of relief. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was indeed off, for after sniffing round again he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) suddenly made up his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) mind, and darted away with an energy and determination such as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had not yet shown. The scent appeared to be much hotter than before, for he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had not even to put his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) nose on the ground, but tugged at his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) leash and tried to break into a run. I cold see by the gleam in Holmes's eyes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) thought we were nearing the end of our journey. Our course now ran down Nine Elms until we came to Broderick and Nelson's large timber-yard, just past the White Eagle tavern. Here the dog, frantic with excitement, turned down through the side-gate into the enclosure, where the sawyers were already at work. On the dog raced through sawdust and shavings, down an alley, round a passage, between two wood-piles, and finally, with a triumphant yelp, sprang upon a large barrel which still stood upon the hand-trolley on which it had been brought. With lolling tongue and blinking eyes, Toby stood upon the cask, looking from one to the other of us for some sign of appreciation.
<p/>The staves of the barrel and the wheels of the trolley were smeared with a dark liquid, and the whole air was heavy with the smell of creasote. Sherlock Holmes and I looked blankly at each other, and then burst simultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter. Chapter VIII The Baker Street Irregulars <div class="bookquote">``What now? ''  (<font color='red'><b>The Baker Street Irregulars</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">``Toby has lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) character for infallibility.''

''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. And, fortunately, we have no distance to go. Evidently what puzzled the dog at the corner of Knight's Place was that there were two different trails running in opposite directions. We took the wrong one. It only remains to follow the other. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was no difficulty about this. On leading Toby to the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) had committed his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) fault, he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) cast about in a wide circle and finally dashed off in a fresh direction. <div class="bookquote">``We must take care that he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) does not now bring us to the place where the creasote-barrel came from,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I observed. <div class="bookquote">``I had thought of that.

''  (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div>It tended down towards the river-side, running through Belmont Place and Prince's Street.
<p/>At the end of Broad Street it ran right down to the water's edge, where there was a small wooden wharf. Toby led us to the very edge of this, and there stood whining, looking out on the dark current beyond. <div class="bookquote">``We are out of luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``They have taken to a boat here.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Several small punts and skiffs were lying about in the water and on the edge of the wharf. We took Toby round to each in turn, but, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) sniffed earnestly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) made no sign. Close to the rude landing-stage was a small brick house, with a wooden placard slung out through the second window. <div class="bookquote">``Mordecai Smith''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was printed across it in large letters, and, underneath, <div class="bookquote">``Boats to hire by the hour or day.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A second inscription above the door informed us that a steam launch was kept,--a statement which was confirmed by a great pile of coke upon the jetty. Sherlock Holmes looked slowly round, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) face assumed an ominous expression. <div class="bookquote">``This looks bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``These fellows are sharper than I expected. They seem to have covered their tracks. There has, I fear, been preconcerted management here.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was approaching the door of the house, when it opened, and a little, curly-headed lad of six came running out, followed by a stoutish, red-faced woman with a large sponge in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``You come back and be washed, Jack,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shouted. <div class="bookquote">``Come back, you young imp; for if your father comes home and finds you like that, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll let us hear of it.''

<p/>It was him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that roused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up yesternight, and, what's more, my man knew he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was comin', for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had steam up in the launch.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What are we to do, then? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, as we landed near Millbank Penitentiary.

That wire was to my dirty little lieutenant, Wiggins, and I expect that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wiggins</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wiggins</b></font>) gang will be with us before we have finished our breakfast. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It was between eight and nine o'clock now, and I was conscious of a strong reaction after the successive excitements of the night. I was limp and weary, befogged in mind and fatigued in body. I had not the professional enthusiasm which carried my companion on, nor could I look at the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem. As far as the death of Bartholomew Sholto went, I had heard little good of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>), and could feel no intense antipathy to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) murderers. The treasure, however, was a different matter.
<p/>That, or part of it, belonged rightfully to Miss Morstan. While there was a chance of recovering it I was ready to devote my life to the one object. True, if I found it it would probably put her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) forever beyond my reach. Yet it would be a petty and selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as that. If Holmes could work to find the criminals, I had a tenfold stronger reason to urge me on to find the treasure. A bath at Baker Street and a complete change freshened me up wonderfully. When I came down to our room I found the breakfast laid and Homes pouring out the coffee. <div class="bookquote">``Here it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>), laughing, and pointing to an open newspaper. '' The energetic Jones and the ubiquitous reporter have fixed it up between them. But you have had enough of the case. Better have your ham and eggs first. '' I took the paper from him (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) and read the short notice, which was headed <div class="bookquote">``Mysterious Business at Upper Norwood.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``About twelve o'clock last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Standard, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bartholomew Sholto, of Pondicherry Lodge, Upper Norwood, was found dead in his (<font color='blue'><b>Norwood</b></font>) room under circumstances which point to foul play. As far as we can learn, no actual traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto's person, but a valuable collection of Indian gems which the deceased gentleman had inherited from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) father has been carried off. The discovery was first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who had called at the house with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, brother of the deceased.
<p/>By a singular piece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney Jones, the well-known member of the detective police force, happened to be at the Norwood Police Station, and was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm. His (<font color='blue'><b>Norwood</b></font>) trained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the detection of the criminals, with the gratifying result that the brother, Thaddeus Sholto, has already been arrested, together with the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a porter, or gatekeeper, named McMurdo. It is quite certain that the thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house, for Mr. Jones's well-known technical knowledge and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) powers of minute observation have enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not have entered by the door or by the window, but must have made their way across the roof of the building, and so through a trap-door into a room which communicated with that in which the body was found. This fact, which has been very clearly made out, proves conclusively that it was no mere haphazard burglary. The prompt and energetic action of the officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind. We cannot but think that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our detectives more decentralized, and so brought into closer and more effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it gorgeous!''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, grinning over his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) coffee-cup. <div class="bookquote">``What do you think of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested for the crime.''

There was some show of discipline among them, despite their tumultuous entry, for they instantly drew up in line and stood facing us with expectant faces. One of their number, taller and older than the others, stood forward with an air of lounging superiority which was very funny in such a disreputable little scarecrow. '' Got your message, sir,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>scarecrow</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and brought 'em on sharp. Three bob and a tanner for tickets.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Here you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, producing some silver. '' In future they can report to you, Wiggins, and you to me. I cannot have the house invaded in this way. However, it is just as well that you should all hear the instructions. I want to find the whereabouts of a steam launch called the Aurora, owner Mordecai Smith, black with two red streaks, funnel black with a white band. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is down the river somewhere. I want one boy to be at Mordecai Smith's landing-stage opposite Millbank to say if the boat comes back. You must divide it out among yourselves, and do both banks thoroughly.
<p/>Let me know the moment you have news. Is that all clear?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, guv`nor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wiggins</b></font>)</div>said Wiggins. '' The old scale of pay, and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat. Here's a day in advance. Now off you go!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) handed them a shilling each, and away they buzzed down the stairs, and I saw them a moment later streaming down the street. <div class="bookquote">``If the launch is above water they will find her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) rose from the table and lit his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) pipe. <div class="bookquote">``They can go everywhere, see everything, overhear every one. I expect to hear before evening that they have spotted her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). In the mean while, we can do nothing but await results.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Toby could eat these scraps, I dare say. Are you going to bed, Holmes?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No: I am not tired. I have a curious constitution. I never remember feeling tired by work, though idleness exhausts me completely. I am going to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair client has introduced us. If ever man had an easy task, this of ours ought to be. Wooden-legged men are not so common, but the other man must, I should think, be absolutely unique.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That other man again!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have no wish to make a mystery of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--to you, anyway. But you must have formed your own opinion. Now, do consider the data. Diminutive footmarks, toes never fettered by boots, naked feet, stone-headed wooden mace, great agility, small poisoned darts. What do you make of all this?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A savage!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed. '' Perhaps one of those Indians who were the associates of Jonathan Small.'' <div class="bookquote">``Hardly that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>). ''
<p/>When first I saw signs of strange weapons I was inclined to think so; but the remarkable character of the footmarks caused me to reconsider my views. Some of the inhabitants of the Indian Peninsula are small men, but none could have left such marks as that. The Hindoo proper has long and thin feet. The sandal-wearing Mohammedan has the great toe well separated from the others, because the thong is commonly passed between. These little darts, too, could only be shot in one way. They are from a blow-pipe. Now, then, where are we to find our savage?'' <div class="bookquote">``South American,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hazarded. He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) hand up, and took down a bulky volume from the shelf. <div class="bookquote">``This is the first volume of a gazetteer which is now being published. It may be looked upon as the very latest authority. What have we here? ' Andaman Islands, situated 340 miles to the north of Sumatra, in the Bay of Bengal.' Hum! hum! What's all this? Moist climate, coral reefs, sharks, Port Blair, convict-barracks, Rutland Island, cottonwoods-- Ah, here we are. ' The aborigines of the Andaman Islands may perhaps claim the distinction of being the smallest race upon this earth, though some anthropologists prefer the Bushmen of Africa, the Digger Indians of America, and the Terra del Fuegians. The average height is rather below four feet, although many full-grown adults may be found who are very much smaller than this. They are a fierce, morose, and intractable people, though capable of forming most devoted friendships when their confidence has once been gained.' Mark that, Watson. Now, then, listen to this. ' They are naturally hideous, having large, misshapen heads, small, fierce eyes, and distorted features. Their feet and hands, however, are remarkably small.
<p/>So intractable and fierce are they that all the efforts of the British official have failed to win them over in any degree. They have always been a terror to shipwrecked crews, braining the survivors with their stone-headed clubs, or shooting them with their poisoned arrows. These massacres are invariably concluded by a cannibal feast.' Nice, amiable people, Watson! If this fellow had been left to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own unaided devices this affair might have taken an even more ghastly turn. I fancy that, even as it is, Jonathan Small would give a good deal not to have employed him (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But how came he (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) to have so singular a companion?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that is more than I can tell. Since, however, we had already determined that Small had come from the Andamans, it is not so very wonderful that this islander should be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>). No doubt we shall know all about it in time. Look here, Watson; you look regularly done. Lie down there on the sofa, and see if I can put you to sleep.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) violin from the corner, and as I stretched myself out he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) began to play some low, dreamy, melodious air,--his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) own, no doubt, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) had a remarkable gift for improvisation. I have a vague remembrance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) gaunt limbs, his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) earnest face, and the rise and fall of his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) bow. Then I seemed to be floated peacefully away upon a soft sea of sound, until I found myself in dream-land, with the sweet face of Mary Morstan looking down upon me. Chapter IX A Break in the Chain It was late in the afternoon before I woke, strengthened and refreshed.
<p/>Sherlock Holmes still sat exactly as I had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), save that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) had laid aside his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) violin and was deep in a book. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) looked across at me, as I stirred, and I noticed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) face was dark and troubled. <div class="bookquote">``You have slept soundly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I feared that our talk would wake you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I heard nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. <div class="bookquote">``Have you had fresh news, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Unfortunately, no. I confess that I am surprised and disappointed. I expected something definite by this time. Wiggins has just been up to report. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wiggins</b></font>) says that no trace can be found of the launch. It is a provoking check, for every hour is of importance.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can I do anything? I am perfectly fresh now, and quite ready for another night's outing.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, we can do nothing. We can only wait. If we go ourselves, the message might come in our absence, and delay be caused. You can do what you will, but I must remain on guard.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then I shall run over to Camberwell and call upon Mrs. Cecil Forrester.

(<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>asked Holmes, with the twinkle of a smile in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) eyes. '' Well, of course Miss Morstan too. They were anxious to hear what happened.'' <div class="bookquote">``I would not tell them too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``Women are never to be entirely trusted,--not the best of them. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I did not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment. <div class="bookquote">``I shall be back in an hour or two,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked. '' All right! Good luck! But, I say, if you are crossing the river you may as well return Toby, for I don't think it is at all likely that we shall have any use for him (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) now.
<p/>'' I took our mongrel accordingly, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>), together with a half-sovereign, at the old naturalist's in Pinchin Lane. At Camberwell I found Miss Morstan a little weary after her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) night's adventures, but very eager to hear the news. Mrs. Forrester, too, was full of curiosity. I told them all that we had done, suppressing, however, the more dreadful parts of the tragedy. Thus, although I spoke of Mr. Sholto's death, I said nothing of the exact manner and method of it. With all my omissions, however, there was enough to startle and amaze them. <div class="bookquote">``It is a romance!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cecil Forrester/Mrs. Forrester</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Forrester. '' An injured lady, half a million in treasure, a black cannibal, and a wooden-legged ruffian. They take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl.'' <div class="bookquote">``And two knight-errants to the rescue,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>added Miss Morstan, with a bright glance at me. '' Why, Mary, your fortune depends upon the issue of this search. I don't think that you are nearly excited enough. Just imagine what it must be to be so rich, and to have the world at your feet!'' It sent a little thrill of joy to my heart to notice that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) showed no sign of elation at the prospect. On the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gave a toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) proud head, as though the matter were one in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) took small interest. <div class="bookquote">``It is for Mr. Thaddeus Sholto that I am anxious,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing else is of any consequence; but I think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) has behaved most kindly and honorably throughout. It is our duty to clear him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) of this dreadful and unfounded charge. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It was evening before I left Camberwell, and quite dark by the time I reached home.
<p/>My companion's book and pipe lay by his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) chair, but he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had disappeared. I looked about in the hope of seeing a note, but there was none. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose that Mr. Sherlock Holmes has gone out,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said to Mrs. Hudson as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hudson</b></font>) came up to lower the blinds. '' No, sir. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) has gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) room, sir. Do you know, sir,'' sinking her (<font color='blue'><b>Hudson</b></font>) voice into an impressive whisper, <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid for his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) health?''

Then I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) talking to himself and muttering, and every time the bell rang out he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) came on the stairhead, with `What is that, Mrs. Hudson?' And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) has slammed off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) room, but I can hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) walking away the same as ever. I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)'s not going to be ill, sir. I ventured to say something to him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) about cooling medicine, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) turned on me, sir, with such a look that I don't know how ever I got out of the room.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't think that you have any cause to be uneasy, Mrs. Hudson,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. <div class="bookquote">``I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) like this before.

(<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to speak lightly to our worthy landlady, but I was myself somewhat uneasy when through the long night I still from time to time heard the dull sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) tread, and knew how his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) keen spirit was chafing against this involuntary inaction. At breakfast-time he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) looked worn and haggard, with a little fleck of feverish color upon either cheek.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are knocking yourself up, old man,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked. <div class="bookquote">``I heard you marching about in the night.''

There were articles in most of the papers upon the Norwood tragedy. They all appeared to be rather hostile to the unfortunate Thaddeus Sholto. No fresh details were to be found, however, in any of them, save that an inquest was to be held upon the following day. I walked over to Camberwell in the evening to report our ill success to the ladies, and on my return I found Holmes dejected and somewhat morose.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) would hardly reply to my questions, and busied himself all evening in an abstruse chemical analysis which involved much heating of retorts and distilling of vapors, ending at last in a smell which fairly drove me out of the apartment. Up to the small hours of the morning I could hear the clinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) test-tubes which told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was still engaged in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) malodorous experiment. In the early dawn I woke with a start, and was surprised to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) standing by my bedside, clad in a rude sailor dress with a pea-jacket, and a coarse red scarf round his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) neck. <div class="bookquote">``I am off down the river, Watson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I have been turning it over in my mind, and I can see only one way out of it. It is worth trying, at all events.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Surely I can come with you, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``No; you can be much more useful if you will remain here as my representative. I am loath to go, for it is quite on the cards that some message may come during the day, though Wiggins was despondent about it last night. I want you to open all notes and telegrams, and to act on your own judgment if any news should come. Can I rely upon you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Most certainly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me, for I can hardly tell yet where I may find myself. If I am in luck, however, I may not be gone so very long. I shall have news of some sort or other before I get back. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had heard nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) by breakfast-time. On opening the Standard, however, I found that there was a fresh allusion to the business. ''
<p/>With reference to the Upper Norwood tragedy,'' it remarked, <div class="bookquote">``we have reason to believe that the matter promises to be even more complex and mysterious than was originally supposed. Fresh evidence has shown that it is quite impossible that Mr. Thaddeus Sholto could have been in any way concerned in the matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) and the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, were both released yesterday evening. It is believed, however, that the police have a clue as to the real culprits, and that it is being prosecuted by Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) well-known energy and sagacity. Further arrests may be expected at any moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>Norwood</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is satisfactory so far as it goes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>thought I. <div class="bookquote">``Friend Sholto is safe, at any rate. I wonder what the fresh clue may be; though it seems to be a stereotyped form whenever the police have made a blunder. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>I tossed the paper down upon the table, but at that moment my eye caught an advertisement in the agony column. It ran in this way: <div class="bookquote">``Lost.--Whereas Mordecai Smith, boatman, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) son, Jim, left Smith's Wharf at or about three o'clock last Tuesday morning in the steam launch Aurora, black with two red stripes, funnel black with a white band, the sum of five pounds will be paid to any one who can give information to Mrs. Smith, at Smith's Wharf, or at 221b Baker Street, as to the whereabouts of the said Mordecai Smith and the launch Aurora. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>This was clearly Holmes's doing. The Baker Street address was enough to prove that. It struck me as rather ingenious, because it might be read by the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the natural anxiety of a wife for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) missing husband. It was a long day.
<p/>Every time that a knock came to the door, or a sharp step passed in the street, I imagined that it was either Holmes returning or an answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) advertisement. I tried to read, but my thoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill-assorted and villainous pair whom we were pursuing. Could there be, I wondered, some radical flaw in my companion's reasoning. Might he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) be suffering from some huge self-deception? Was it not possible that his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) nimble and speculative mind had built up this wild theory upon faulty premises? I had never known him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) to be wrong; and yet the keenest reasoner may occasionally be deceived. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was likely, I thought, to fall into error through the over-refinement of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) logic,--his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) preference for a subtle and bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one lay ready to his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) hand. Yet, on the other hand, I had myself seen the evidence, and I had heard the reasons for his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) deductions. When I looked back on the long chain of curious circumstances, many of them trivial in themselves, but all tending in the same direction, I could not disguise from myself that even if Holmes's explanation were incorrect the true theory must be equally outre and startling. At three o'clock in the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell, an authoritative voice in the hall, and, to my surprise, no less a person than Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me. Very different was he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>), however, from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who had taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood. His (<font color='blue'><b>Norwood</b></font>) expression was downcast, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Norwood</b></font>) bearing meek and even apologetic. '' Good-day, sir; good-day,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Norwood</b></font>). '' Mr. Sherlock Holmes is out, I understand.'' ''
<p/>Yes, and I cannot be sure when he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) will be back. But perhaps you would care to wait. Take that chair and try one of these cigars.'' <div class="bookquote">``Thank you; I don't mind if I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), mopping his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) face with a red bandanna handkerchief. <div class="bookquote">``And a whiskey-and-soda?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, half a glass. It is very hot for the time of year; and I have had a good deal to worry and try me. You know my theory about this Norwood case? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I remember that you expressed one.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I have been obliged to reconsider it. I had my net drawn tightly round Mr. Sholto, sir, when pop he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) went through a hole in the middle of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken. From the time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) brother's room he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) was never out of sight of some one or other. So it could not be he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) who climbed over roofs and through trap-doors. It's a very dark case, and my professional credit is at stake. I should be very glad of a little assistance.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We all need help sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Your friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes is a wonderful man, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), in a husky and confidential voice. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)'s a man who is not to be beat. I have known that young man go into a good many cases, but I never saw the case yet that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not throw a light upon. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is irregular in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) methods, and a little quick perhaps in jumping at theories, but, on the whole, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have made a most promising officer, and I don't care who knows it.
<p/>I have had a wire from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) this morning, by which I understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has got some clue to this Sholto business. Here is the message.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took the telegram out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket, and handed it to me. It was dated from Poplar at twelve o'clock. <div class="bookquote">``Go to Baker Street at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it said. <div class="bookquote">``If I have not returned, wait for me. I am close on the track of the Sholto gang. You can come with us to-night if you want to be in at the finish.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This sounds well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) has evidently picked up the scent again,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. '' Ah, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) has been at fault too,'' exclaimed Jones, with evident satisfaction. <div class="bookquote">``Even the best of us are thrown off sometimes. Of course this may prove to be a false alarm; but it is my duty as an officer of the law to allow no chance to slip. But there is some one at the door. Perhaps this is he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>A heavy step was heard ascending the stair, with a great wheezing and rattling as from a man who was sorely put to it for breath. Once or twice he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped, as though the climb were too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way to our door and entered. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appearance corresponded to the sounds which we had heard. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was an aged man, clad in seafaring garb, with an old pea-jacket buttoned up to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throat. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back was bowed, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees were shaky, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breathing was painfully asthmatic. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lungs.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a colored scarf round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chin, and I could see little of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face save a pair of keen dark eyes, overhung by bushy white brows, and long gray side-whiskers. Altogether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave me the impression of a respectable master mariner who had fallen into years and poverty. '' What is it, my man? '' I asked. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the slow methodical fashion of old age. '' Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). '' No; but I am acting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). You can tell me any message you have for him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``It was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) himself I was to tell it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But I tell you that I am acting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>).

'' Well, you must wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``No, no; I ain't goin' to lose a whole day to please no one. If Mr. Holmes ain't here, then Mr. Holmes must find it all out for himself. I don't care about the look of either of you, and I won't tell a word.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) shuffled towards the door, but Athelney Jones got in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>). '' Wait a bit, my friend,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You have important information, and you must not walk off. We shall keep you, whether you like or not, until our friend returns.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The old man made a little run towards the door, but, as Athelney Jones put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) broad back up against it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) recognized the uselessness of resistance. '' Pretty sort o' treatment this!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) cried, stamping his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) stick. <div class="bookquote">``I come here to see a gentleman, and you two, who I never saw in my life, seize me and treat me in this fashion!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You will be none the worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``We shall recompense you for the loss of your time. Sit over here on the sofa, and you will not have long to wait.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) came across sullenly enough, and seated himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) face resting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) hands. Jones and I resumed our cigars and our talk. Suddenly, however, Holmes's voice broke in upon us. <div class="bookquote">``I think that you might offer me a cigar too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said. We both started in our chairs. There was Holmes sitting close to us with an air of quiet amusement. <div class="bookquote">``Holmes!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``You here! But where is the old man?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Here is the old man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), holding out a heap of white hair. <div class="bookquote">``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is,--wig, whiskers, eyebrows, and all. I thought my disguise was pretty good, but I hardly expected that it would stand that test.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, You rogue!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jones/Athelney Jones/Mr. Athelney Jones</b></font>)</div>cried Jones, highly delighted. <div class="bookquote">``You would have made an actor, and a rare one. You had the proper workhouse cough, and those weak legs of yours are worth ten pound a week. I thought I knew the glint of your eye, though. You didn't get away from us so easily, You see.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have been working in that get-up all day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>), lighting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) cigar.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, a good many of the criminal classes begin to know me,--especially since our friend here took to publishing some of my cases: so I can only go on the war-path under some simple disguise like this.

(<font color='red'><b>the Islander</b></font>)</div>Chapter X The End of the Islander Our meal was a merry one. Holmes could talk exceedingly well when he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) chose, and that night he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) did choose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) appeared to be in a state of nervous exaltation. I have never known him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) so brilliant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) spoke on a quick succession of subjects,--on miracle-plays, on medieval pottery, on Stradivarius violins, on the Buddhism of Ceylon, and on the war-ships of the future,--handling each as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) had made a special study of it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) bright humor marked the reaction from his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) black depression of the preceding days. Athelney Jones proved to be a sociable soul in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) hours of relaxation, and faced his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) dinner with the air of a bon vivant. For myself, I felt elated at the thought that we were nearing the end of our task, and I caught something of Holmes's gaiety.
<p/>None of us alluded during dinner to the cause which had brought us together. When the cloth was cleared, Holmes glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) watch, and filled up three glasses with port. <div class="bookquote">``One bumper,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``to the success of our little expedition. And now it is high time we were off. Have you a pistol, Watson?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have my old service-revolver in my desk.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You had best take it, then. It is well to be prepared. I see that the cab is at the door. I ordered it for half-past six. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was a little past seven before we reached the Westminster wharf, and found our launch awaiting us. Holmes eyed it critically. '' Is there anything to mark it as a police-boat? '' <div class="bookquote">``Yes,--that green lamp at the side.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then take it off. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The small change was made, we stepped on board, and the ropes were cast off. Jones, Holmes, and I sat in the stern. There was one man at the rudder, one to tend the engines, and two burly police-inspectors forward. '' Where to? '' asked Jones. '' To the Tower. Tell them to stop opposite Jacobson's Yard. '' Our craft was evidently a very fast one. We shot past the long lines of loaded barges as though they were stationary. Holmes smiled with satisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) behind us. <div class="bookquote">``We ought to be able to catch anything on the river,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Well, hardly that. But there are not many launches to beat us.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We shall have to catch the Aurora, and she (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) has a name for being a clipper. I will tell you how the land lies, Watson. You recollect how annoyed I was at being balked by so small a thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical analysis. One of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work is the best rest. So it is. When I had succeeded in dissolving the hydrocarbon which I was at work at, I came back to our problem of the Sholtos, and thought the whole matter out again. My boys had been up the river and down the river without result. The launch was not at any landing-stage or wharf, nor had it returned. Yet it could hardly have been scuttled to hide their traces,--though that always remained as a possible hypothesis if all else failed. I knew this man Small had a certain degree of low cunning, but I did not think him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) capable of anything in the nature of delicate finesse. That is usually a product of higher education. I then reflected that since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had certainly been in London some time--as we had evidence that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) maintained a continual watch over Pondicherry Lodge--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hardly leave at a moment's notice, but would need some little time, if it were only a day, to arrange his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affairs. That was the balance of probability, at any rate.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me to be a little weak,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``It is more probable that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had arranged his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affairs before ever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) set out upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expedition. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I hardly think so. This lair of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be too valuable a retreat in case of need for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to give it up until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could do without it. But a second consideration struck me.
<p/>Jonathan Small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) companion, however much he (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>) may have top-coated him (<font color='blue'><b>Small</b></font>), would give rise to gossip, and possibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Norwood</b></font>) was quite sharp enough to see that. They had started from their head-quarters under cover of darkness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Norwood</b></font>) would wish to get back before it was broad light. Now, it was past three o'clock, according to Mrs. Smith, when they got the boat. It would be quite bright, and people would be about in an hour or so. Therefore, I argued, they did not go very far. They paid Smith well to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Norwood</b></font>) tongue, reserved his (<font color='blue'><b>Norwood</b></font>) launch for the final escape, and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box. In a couple of nights, when they had time to see what view the papers took, and whether there was any suspicion, they would make their way under cover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs, where no doubt they had already arranged for passages to America or the Colonies.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But the launch? They could not have taken that to their lodgings.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Quite so. I argued that the launch must be no great way off, in spite of its invisibility. I then put myself in the place of Small, and looked at it as a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) capacity would. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would probably consider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) track. How, then, could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conceal the launch and yet have her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) at hand when wanted? I wondered what I should do myself if I were in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoes. I could only think of one way of doing it.
<p/>I might land the launch over to some boat-builder or repairer, with directions to make a trifling change in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would then be removed to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shed or yard, and so be effectually concealed, while at the same time I could have her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) at a few hours' notice.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That seems simple enough.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to be overlooked. However, I determined to act on the idea. I started at once in this harmless seaman's rig and inquired at all the yards down the river. I drew blank at fifteen, but at the sixteenth--Jacobson's --I learned that the Aurora had been handed over to them two days ago by a wooden-legged man, with some trivial directions as to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) rudder. ' There ain't naught amiss with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) rudder,' said the foreman. ' There she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lies, with the red streaks.' At that moment who should come down but Mordecai Smith, the missing owner? He (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was rather the worse for liquor. I should not, of course, have known him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) bellowed out his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) name and the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) launch. ' I want her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to-night at eight o'clock,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>),--`eight o'clock sharp, mind, for I have two gentlemen who won't be kept waiting.' They had evidently paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) well, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was very flush of money, chucking shillings about to the men. I followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) some distance, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) subsided into an ale-house: so I went back to the yard, and, happening to pick up one of my boys on the way, I stationed him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) as a sentry over the launch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is to stand at water's edge and wave his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) handkerchief to us when they start.
<p/>We shall be lying off in the stream, and it will be a strange thing if we do not take men, treasure, and all.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You have planned it all very neatly, whether they are the right men or not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jones/Athelney Jones/Mr. Athelney Jones</b></font>)</div>said Jones; <div class="bookquote">``but if the affair were in my hands I should have had a body of police in Jacobson's Yard, and arrested them when they came down.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jones/Athelney Jones/Mr. Athelney Jones</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Which would have been never. This man Small is a pretty shrewd fellow.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you might have stuck to Mordecai Smith, and so been led to their hiding-place,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. '' In that case I should have wasted my day. I think that it is a hundred to one against Smith knowing where they live. As long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) has liquor and good pay, why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) ask questions? They send him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) messages what to do. No, I thought over every possible course, and this is the best.'' While this conversation had been proceeding, we had been shooting the long series of bridges which span the Thames. As we passed the City the last rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon the summit of St. Paul's. It was twilight before we reached the Tower. <div class="bookquote">``That is Jacobson's Yard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, pointing to a bristle of masts and rigging on the Surrey side. <div class="bookquote">``Cruise gently up and down here under cover of this string of lighters.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cruise</b></font>) took a pair of night-glasses from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruise</b></font>) pocket and gazed some time at the shore. <div class="bookquote">``I see my sentry at his (<font color='blue'><b>sentry</b></font>) post,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>sentry</b></font>) remarked, <div class="bookquote">``but no sign of a handkerchief.''

<p/>We were all eager by this time, even the policemen and stokers, who had a very vague idea of what was going forward. <div class="bookquote">``We have no right to take anything for granted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>Holmes answered. <div class="bookquote">``It is certainly ten to one that they go down-stream, but we cannot be certain.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Some one calls him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a soul concealed in an animal,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I suggested. <div class="bookquote">``Winwood Reade is good upon the subject,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) remarks that, while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) becomes a mathematical certainty. You can, for example, never foretell what any one man will do, but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to. Individuals vary, but percentages remain constant. So says the statistician. But do I see a handkerchief? Surely there is a white flutter over yonder.'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is your boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried. <div class="bookquote">``I can see him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) plainly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And there is the Aurora,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Holmes, <div class="bookquote">``and going like the devil! Full speed ahead, engineer. Make after that launch with the yellow light. By heaven, I shall never forgive myself if she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) proves to have the heels of us!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had slipped unseen through the yard-entrance and passed behind two or three small craft, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had fairly got her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) speed up before we saw her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). Now she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was flying down the stream, near in to the shore, going at a tremendous rate. Jones looked gravely at her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is very fast,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I doubt if we shall catch her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We MUST catch her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>cried Holmes, between his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) teeth. <div class="bookquote">``Heap it on, stokers! Make her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) do all she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) can! If we burn the boat we must have them! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We were fairly after her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) now. The furnaces roared, and the powerful engines whizzed and clanked, like a great metallic heart. Her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sharp, steep prow cut through the river-water and sent two rolling waves to right and to left of us. With every throb of the engines we sprang and quivered like a living thing. One great yellow lantern in our bows threw a long, flickering funnel of light in front of us. Right ahead a dark blur upon the water showed where the Aurora lay, and the swirl of white foam behind her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spoke of the pace at which she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was going. We flashed past barges, steamers, merchant-vessels, in and out, behind this one and round the other. Voices hailed us out of the darkness, but still the Aurora thundered on, and still we followed close upon her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) track. '' Pile it on, men, pile it on!'' cried Holmes, looking down into the engine-room, while the fierce glow from below beat upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) eager, aquiline face. <div class="bookquote">``Get every pound of steam you can.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think we gain a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jones/Athelney Jones/Mr. Athelney Jones</b></font>)</div>said Jones, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) eyes on the Aurora. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall be up with her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in a very few minutes.''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>At that moment, however, as our evil fate would have it, a tug with three barges in tow blundered in between us. It was only by putting our helm hard down that we avoided a collision, and before we could round them and recover our way the Aurora had gained a good two hundred yards. She (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was still, however, well in view, and the murky uncertain twilight was setting into a clear starlit night. Our boilers were strained to their utmost, and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with the fierce energy which was driving us along. We had shot through the Pool, past the West India Docks, down the long Deptford Reach, and up again after rounding the Isle of Dogs. The dull blur in front of us resolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty Aurora. Jones turned our search-light upon her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), so that we could plainly see the figures upon her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) deck. One man sat by the stern, with something black between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees over which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stooped. Beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay a dark mass which looked like a Newfoundland dog. The boy held the tiller, while against the red glare of the furnace I could see old Smith, stripped to the waist, and shovelling coals for dear life. They may have had some doubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them, but now as we followed every winding and turning which they took there could no longer be any question about it. At Greenwich we were about three hundred paces behind them. At Blackwall we could not have been more than two hundred and fifty.
<p/>I have coursed many creatures in many countries during my checkered career, but never did sport give me such a wild thrill as this mad, flying man-hunt down the Thames. Steadily we drew in upon them, yard by yard. In the silence of the night we could hear the panting and clanking of their machinery. The man in the stern still crouched upon the deck, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms were moving as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were busy, while every now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would look up and measure with a glance the distance which still separated us. Nearer we came and nearer. Jones yelled to them to stop. We were not more than four boat's lengths behind them, both boats flying at a tremendous pace. It was a clear reach of the river, with Barking Level upon one side and the melancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other. At our hail the man in the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two clinched fists at us, cursing the while in a high, cracked voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a good-sized, powerful man, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood poising himself with legs astride I could see that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump upon the right side. At the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strident, angry cries there was movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck. It straightened itself into a little black man--the smallest I have ever seen--with a great, misshapen head and a shock of tangled, dishevelled hair. Holmes had already drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) revolver, and I whipped out mine at the sight of this savage, distorted creature. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster or blanket, which left only his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) face exposed; but that face was enough to give a man a sleepless night.
<p/>Never have I seen features so deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) small eyes glowed and burned with a sombre light, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thick lips were writhed back from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with a half animal fury. <div class="bookquote">``Fire if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) raises his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, quietly. We were within a boat's-length by this time, and almost within touch of our quarry. I can see the two of them now as they stood, the white man with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs far apart, shrieking out curses, and the unhallowed dwarf with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hideous face, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light of our lantern. It was well that we had so clear a view of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Even as we looked he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plucked out from under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) covering a short, round piece of wood, like a school-ruler, and clapped it to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips. Our pistols rang out together. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whirled round, threw up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms, and with a kind of choking cough fell sideways into the stream. I caught one glimpse of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters. At the same moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudder and put it hard down, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) boat made straight in for the southern bank, while we shot past her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) stern, only clearing her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) by a few feet. We were round after her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) in an instant, but she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) was already nearly at the bank. It was a wild and desolate place, where the moon glimmered upon a wide expanse of marsh-land, with pools of stagnant water and beds of decaying vegetation. The launch with a dull thud ran up upon the mud-bank, with her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) bow in the air and her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) stern flush with the water.
<p/>The fugitive sprang out, but his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) stump instantly sank its whole length into the sodden soil. In vain he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) struggled and writhed. Not one step could he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) possibly take either forwards or backwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) yelled in impotent rage, and kicked frantically into the mud with his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) other foot, but his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) struggles only bored his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) wooden pin the deeper into the sticky bank. When we brought our launch alongside he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) was so firmly anchored that it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) shoulders that we were able to haul him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) out, and to drag him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>), like some evil fish, over our side. The two Smiths, father and son, sat sullenly in their launch, but came aboard meekly enough when commanded. The Aurora herself we hauled off and made fast to our stern. A solid iron chest of Indian workmanship stood upon the deck. This, there could be no question, was the same that had contained the ill-omened treasure of the Sholtos. There was no key, but it was of considerable weight, so we transferred it carefully to our own little cabin. As we steamed slowly up-stream again, we flashed our search-light in every direction, but there was no sign of the Islander. Somewhere in the dark ooze at the bottom of the Thames lie the bones of that strange visitor to our shores. '' See here,'' said Holmes, pointing to the wooden hatchway. <div class="bookquote">``We were hardly quick enough with our pistols.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There, sure enough, just behind where we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts which we knew so well. It must have whizzed between us at the instant that we fired.
<p/>Holmes smiled at it and shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) shoulders in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) easy fashion, but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the horrible death which had passed so close to us that night. Chapter XI The Great Agra Treasure Our captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) had done so much and waited so long to gain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was a sunburned, reckless-eyed fellow, with a net-work of lines and wrinkles all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) mahogany features, which told of a hard, open-air life. There was a singular prominence about his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) bearded chin which marked a man who was not to be easily turned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) purpose. His (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) age may have been fifty or thereabouts, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) black, curly hair was thickly shot with gray. His (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) face in repose was not an unpleasing one, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) heavy brows and aggressive chin gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), as I had lately seen, a terrible expression when moved to anger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) sat now with his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) handcuffed hands upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) lap, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) head sunk upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) breast, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) looked with his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) keen, twinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) ill-doings. It seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) rigid and contained countenance. Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) looked up at me with a gleam of something like humor in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) eyes. '' Well, Jonathan Small,'' said Holmes, lighting a cigar, <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry that it has come to this.''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And so am I, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) answered, frankly. <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe that I can swing over the job. I give you my word on the book that I never raised hand against Mr. Sholto. It was that little hell-hound Tonga who shot one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) cursed darts into him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>).
<p/>I had no part in it, sir. I was as grieved as if it had been my blood-relation. I welted the little devil with the slack end of the rope for it, but it was done, and I could not undo it again.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Have a cigar,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes; <div class="bookquote">``and you had best take a pull out of my flask, for you are very wet. How could you expect so small and weak a man as this black fellow to overpower Mr. Sholto and hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) while you were climbing the rope?''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You seem to know as much about it as if you were there, sir. The truth is that I hoped to find the room clear. I knew the habits of the house pretty well, and it was the time when Mr. Sholto usually went down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) supper. I shall make no secret of the business. The best defence that I can make is just the simple truth. Now, if it had been the old major I would have swung for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) with a light heart. I would have thought no more of knifing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) than of smoking this cigar. But it's cursed hard that I should be lagged over this young Sholto, with whom I had no quarrel whatever.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are under the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) is going to bring you up to my rooms, and I shall ask you for a true account of the matter. You must make a clean breast of it, for if you do I hope that I may be of use to you. I think I can prove that the poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached the room.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, sir.
<p/>I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grinning at me with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder as I climbed through the window. It fairly shook me, sir. I'd have half killed Tonga for it if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not scrambled off. That was how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) club, and some of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) darts too, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tells me, which I dare say helped to put you on our track; though how you kept on it is more than I can tell. I don't feel no malice against you for it. But it does seem a queer thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, with a bitter smile, <div class="bookquote">``that I who have a fair claim to nigh upon half a million of money should spend the first half of my life building a breakwater in the Andamans, and am like to spend the other half digging drains at Dartmoor. It was an evil day for me when first I clapped eyes upon the merchant Achmet and had to do with the Agra treasure, which never brought anything but a curse yet upon the man who owned it. To him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) it brought murder, to Major Sholto it brought fear and guilt, to me it has meant slavery for life. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At this moment Athelney Jones thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) broad face and heavy shoulders into the tiny cabin. '' Quite a family party,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) remarked. <div class="bookquote">``I think I shall have a pull at that flask, Holmes. Well, I think we may all congratulate each other. Pity we didn't take the other alive; but there was no choice. I say, Holmes, you must confess that you cut it rather fine. It was all we could do to overhaul her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All is well that ends well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. ''
<p/>But I certainly did not know that the Aurora was such a clipper.'' <div class="bookquote">``Smith says she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is one of the fastest launches on the river, and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) had had another man to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) with the engines we should never have caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) swears he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) knew nothing of this Norwood business.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Neither he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) did,''  (<font color='red'><b>prisoner word</b></font>)</div>cried our prisoner,--<div class="bookquote">``not a word.

We told him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) nothing, but we paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) well, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was to get something handsome if we reached our vessel, the Esmeralda, at Gravesend, outward bound for the Brazils.''  (<font color='red'><b>prisoner word</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes to him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>).

(<font color='red'><b>Jones/Athelney Jones/Mr. Athelney Jones</b></font>)</div>It was amusing to notice how the consequential Jones was already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of the capture. From the slight smile which played over Sherlock Holmes's face, I could see that the speech had not been lost upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jones/Athelney Jones/Mr. Athelney Jones</b></font>)</div>said Jones, <div class="bookquote">``and shall land you, Dr. Watson, with the treasure-box. I need hardly tell you that I am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this. It is most irregular; but of course an agreement is an agreement. I must, however, as a matter of duty, send an inspector with you, since you have so valuable a charge. You will drive, no doubt?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jones/Athelney Jones/Mr. Athelney Jones</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I shall drive.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is a pity there is no key, that we may make an inventory first. You will have to break it open. Where is the key, my man?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``At the bottom of the river,''  (<font color='red'><b>Small</b></font>)</div>said Small, shortly. '' Hum!
<p/>There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble. We have had work enough already through you. However, doctor, I need not warn you to be careful. Bring the box back with you to the Baker Street rooms. You will find us there, on our way to the station. '' They landed me at Vauxhall, with my heavy iron box, and with a bluff, genial inspector as my companion. A quarter of an hour's drive brought us to Mrs. Cecil Forrester's. The servant seemed surprised at so late a visitor. Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, she (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) explained, and likely to be very late. Miss Morstan, however, was in the drawing-room: so to the drawing-room I went, box in hand, leaving the obliging inspector in the cab. She (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) was seated by the open window, dressed in some sort of white diaphanous material, with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and waist. The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) leaned back in the basket chair, playing over her (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) sweet, grave face, and tinting with a dull, metallic sparkle the rich coils of her (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) luxuriant hair. One white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy. At the sound of my foot-fall she (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) sprang to her (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) feet, however, and a bright flush of surprise and of pleasure colored her (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) pale cheeks. <div class="bookquote">``I heard a cab drive up,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I thought that Mrs. Forrester had come back very early, but I never dreamed that it might be you. What news have you brought me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have brought something better than news,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, putting down the box upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously, though my heart was heavy within me. <div class="bookquote">``I have brought you something which is worth all the news in the world. I have brought you a fortune.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) glanced at the iron box. <div class="bookquote">``Is that the treasure, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) asked, coolly enough. '' Yes, this is the great Agra treasure. Half of it is yours and half is Thaddeus Sholto's. You will have a couple of hundred thousand each. Think of that! An annuity of ten thousand pounds. There will be few richer young ladies in England. Is it not glorious? '' I think that I must have been rather overacting my delight, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) detected a hollow ring in my congratulations, for I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) eyebrows rise a little, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) glanced at me curiously. <div class="bookquote">``If I have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I owe it to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, <div class="bookquote">``not to me, but to my friend Sherlock Holmes. With all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a clue which has taxed even his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) analytical genius. As it was, we very nearly lost it at the last moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Watson,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>). I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) last,--Holmes's new method of search, the discovery of the Aurora, the appearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and the wild chase down the Thames. She (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) listened with parted lips and shining eyes to my recital of our adventures. When I spoke of the dart which had so narrowly missed us, she (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) turned so white that I feared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) was about to faint.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) said, as I hastened to pour her (<font color='blue'><b>Forrester</b></font>) out some water. <div class="bookquote">``I am all right again. It was a shock to me to hear that I had placed my friends in such horrible peril.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is all over,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. <div class="bookquote">``It was nothing. I will tell you no more gloomy details. Let us turn to something brighter. There is the treasure. What could be brighter than that? I got leave to bring it with me, thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It would be of the greatest interest to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) said. There was no eagerness in her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) voice, however. It had struck her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>), doubtless, that it might seem ungracious upon her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) part to be indifferent to a prize which had cost so much to win. '' What a pretty box! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) said, stooping over it. <div class="bookquote">``This is Indian work, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes; it is Benares metal-work.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And so heavy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) exclaimed, trying to raise it. <div class="bookquote">``The box alone must be of some value. Where is the key?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Small threw it into the Thames,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. <div class="bookquote">``I must borrow Mrs. Forrester's poker.''  (<font color='red'><b>a Buddha</b></font>)</div>There was in the front a thick and broad hasp, wrought in the image of a sitting Buddha. Under this I thrust the end of the poker and twisted it outward as a lever. The hasp sprang open with a loud snap. With trembling fingers I flung back the lid. We both stood gazing in astonishment. The box was empty! No wonder that it was heavy. The iron-work was two-thirds of an inch thick all round. It was massive, well made, and solid, like a chest constructed to carry things of great price, but not one shred or crumb of metal or jewelry lay within it.
<p/>It was absolutely and completely empty. <div class="bookquote">``The treasure is lost,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Morstan, calmly. As I listened to the words and realized what they meant, a great shadow seemed to pass from my soul. I did not know how this Agra treasure had weighed me down, until now that it was finally removed. It was selfish, no doubt, disloyal, wrong, but I could realize nothing save that the golden barrier was gone from between us. <div class="bookquote">``Thank God! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I ejaculated from my very heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) looked at me with a quick, questioning smile. <div class="bookquote">``Why do you say that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Because you are within my reach again,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) did not withdraw it. '' Because I love you, Mary, as truly as ever a man loved a woman. Because this treasure, these riches, sealed my lips. Now that they are gone I can tell you how I love you. That is why I said, `Thank God.''' <div class="bookquote">``Then I say, `Thank God,' too,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) whispered, as I drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to my side. Whoever had lost a treasure, I knew that night that I had gained one. Chapter XII The Strange Story of Jonathan Small A very patient man was that inspector in the cab, for it was a weary time before I rejoined him (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) face clouded over when I showed him (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) the empty box. <div class="bookquote">``There goes the reward!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>), gloomily. <div class="bookquote">``Where there is no money there is no pay. This night's work would have been worth a tenner each to Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) will see that you are rewarded, treasure or no. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The inspector</b></font>)</div>The inspector shook his (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) head despondently, however.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a bad job,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) repeated; <div class="bookquote">``and so Mr. Athelney Jones will think.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) forecast proved to be correct, for the detective looked blank enough when I got to Baker Street and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) the empty box. They had only just arrived, Holmes, the prisoner, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), for they had changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon the way. My companion lounged in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) arm-chair with his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) usual listless expression, while Small sat stolidly opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) wooden leg cocked over his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) sound one. As I exhibited the empty box he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) chair and laughed aloud. <div class="bookquote">``This is your doing, Small,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jones/Athelney Jones/Mr. Athelney Jones</b></font>)</div>said Athelney Jones, angrily. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) cried, exultantly. '' It is my treasure; and if I can't have the loot I'll take darned good care that no one else does. I tell you that no living man has any right to it, unless it is three men who are in the Andaman convict-barracks and myself. I know now that I cannot have the use of it, and I know that they cannot. I have acted all through for them as much as for myself. It's been the sign of four with us always. Well I know that they would have had me do just what I have done, and throw the treasure into the Thames rather than let it go to kith or kin of Sholto or of Morstan. It was not to make them rich that we did for Achmet. You'll find the treasure where the key is, and where little Tonga is. When I saw that your launch must catch us, I put the loot away in a safe place.
<p/>There are no rupees for you this journey.'' <div class="bookquote">``You are deceiving us, Small,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jones/Athelney Jones/Mr. Athelney Jones</b></font>)</div>said Athelney Jones, sternly. <div class="bookquote">``If you had wished to throw the treasure into the Thames it would have been easier for you to have thrown box and all.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Easier for me to throw, and easier for you to recover,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) answered, with a shrewd, sidelong look. <div class="bookquote">``The man that was clever enough to hunt me down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a river. Now that they are scattered over five miles or so, it may be a harder job. It went to my heart to do it, though. I was half mad when you came up with us. However, there's no good grieving over it. I've had ups in my life, and I've had downs, but I've learned not to cry over spilled milk.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This is a very serious matter, Small,''  (<font color='red'><b>the detective</b></font>)</div>said the detective. <div class="bookquote">``If you had helped justice, instead of thwarting it in this way, you would have had a better chance at your trial.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Justice!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>snarled the ex-convict. <div class="bookquote">``A pretty justice! Whose loot is this, if it is not ours? Where is the justice that I should give it up to those who have never earned it? Look how I have earned it! Twenty long years in that fever-ridden swamp, all day at work under the mangrove-tree, all night chained up in the filthy convict-huts, bitten by mosquitoes, racked with ague, bullied by every cursed black-faced policeman who loved to take it out of a white man. That was how I earned the Agra treasure; and you talk to me of justice because I cannot bear to feel that I have paid this price only that another may enjoy it!
<p/>I would rather swing a score of times, or have one of Tonga's darts in my hide, than live in a convict's cell and feel that another man is at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ease in a palace with the money that should be mine. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Small</b></font>)</div>Small had dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mask of stoicism, and all this came out in a wild whirl of words, while his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes blazed, and the handcuffs clanked together with the impassioned movement of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands. I could understand, as I saw the fury and the passion of the man, that it was no groundless or unnatural terror which had possessed Major Sholto when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) first learned that the injured convict was upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) track. '' You forget that we know nothing of all this,'' said Holmes quietly. <div class="bookquote">``We have not heard your story, and we cannot tell how far justice may originally have been on your side.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>``Well, sir, you have been very fair-spoken to me, though I can see that I have you to thank that I have these bracelets upon my wrists. Still, I bear no grudge for that. It is all fair and above-board. If you want to hear my story I have no wish to hold it back. What I say to you is God's truth, every word of it. Thank you; you can put the glass beside me here, and I'll put my lips to it if I am dry. ``I am a Worcestershire man myself,--born near Pershore. I dare say you would find a heap of Smalls living there now if you were to look.
<p/>I have often thought of taking a look round there, but the truth is that I was never much of a credit to the family, and I doubt if they would be so very glad to see me. They were all steady, chapel-going folk, small farmers, well known and respected over the country-side, while I was always a bit of a rover. At last, however, when I was about eighteen, I gave them no more trouble, for I got into a mess over a girl, and could only get out of it again by taking the queen's shilling and joining the 3d Buffs, which was just starting for India. ``I wasn't destined to do much soldiering, however. I had just got past the goose-step, and learned to handle my musket, when I was fool enough to go swimming in the Ganges. Luckily for me, my company sergeant, John Holder, was in the water at the same time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Holder</b></font>) was one of the finest swimmers in the service. A crocodile took me, just as I was half-way across, and nipped off my right leg as clean as a surgeon could have done it, just above the knee. What with the shock and the loss of blood, I fainted, and should have drowned if Holder had not caught hold of me and paddled for the bank. I was five months in hospital over it, and when at last I was able to limp out of it with this timber toe strapped to my stump I found myself invalided out of the army and unfitted for any active occupation. <div class="bookquote">``I was, as you can imagine, pretty down on my luck at this time, for I was a useless cripple though not yet in my twentieth year.
<p/>However, my misfortune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise. A man named Abelwhite, who had come out there as an indigo-planter, wanted an overseer to look after his (<font color='blue'><b>overseer</b></font>) coolies and keep them up to their work. He (<font color='blue'><b>overseer</b></font>) happened to be a friend of our colonel's, who had taken an interest in me since the accident. To make a long story short, the colonel recommended me strongly for the post and, as the work was mostly to be done on horseback, my leg was no great obstacle, for I had enough knee left to keep good grip on the saddle. What I had to do was to ride over the plantation, to keep an eye on the men as they worked, and to report the idlers. The pay was fair, I had comfortable quarters, and altogether I was content to spend the remainder of my life in indigo-planting. Mr. Abelwhite was a kind man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Abelwhite</b></font>) would often drop into my little shanty and smoke a pipe with me, for white folk out there feel their hearts warm to each other as they never do here at home. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Well, I was never in luck's way long. Suddenly, without a note of warning, the great mutiny broke upon us. One month India lay as still and peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the next there were two hundred thousand black devils let loose, and the country was a perfect hell. Of course you know all about it, gentlemen,--a deal more than I do, very like, since reading is not in my line. I only know what I saw with my own eyes. Our plantation was at a place called Muttra, near the border of the Northwest Provinces.
<p/>Night after night the whole sky was alight with the burning bungalows, and day after day we had small companies of Europeans passing through our estate with their wives and children, on their way to Agra, where were the nearest troops. Mr. Abelwhite was an obstinate man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Abelwhite</b></font>) had it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Abelwhite</b></font>) head that the affair had been exaggerated, and that it would blow over as suddenly as it had sprung up. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Abelwhite</b></font>) sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Abelwhite</b></font>) veranda, drinking whiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was in a blaze about him (<font color='blue'><b>Abelwhite</b></font>). Of course we stuck by him (<font color='blue'><b>Abelwhite</b></font>), I and Dawson, who, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) wife, used to do the book-work and the managing. Well, one fine day the crash came. I had been away on a distant plantation, and was riding slowly home in the evening, when my eye fell upon something all huddled together at the bottom of a steep nullah. I rode down to see what it was, and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was Dawson's wife, all cut into ribbons, and half eaten by jackals and native dogs. A little further up the road Dawson himself was lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) face, quite dead, with an empty revolver in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) hand and four Sepoys lying across each other in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>). I reined up my horse, wondering which way I should turn, but at that moment I saw thick smoke curling up from Abelwhite's bungalow and the flames beginning to burst through the roof. I knew then that I could do my employer no good, but would only throw my own life away if I meddled in the matter.
<p/>From where I stood I could see hundreds of the black fiends, with their red coats still on their backs, dancing and howling round the burning house. Some of them pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sang past my head; so I broke away across the paddy-fields, and found myself late at night safe within the walls at Agra. '' As it proved, however, there was no great safety there, either. The whole country was up like a swarm of bees. Wherever the English could collect in little bands they held just the ground that their guns commanded. Everywhere else they were helpless fugitives. It was a fight of the millions against the hundreds; and the cruellest part of it was that these men that we fought against, foot, horse, and gunners, were our own picked troops, whom we had taught and trained, handling our own weapons, and blowing our own bugle-calls. At Agra there were the 3d Bengal Fusiliers, some Sikhs, two troops of horse, and a battery of artillery. A volunteer corps of clerks and merchants had been formed, and this I joined, wooden leg and all. We went out to meet the rebels at Shahgunge early in July, and we beat them back for a time, but our powder gave out, and we had to fall back upon the city. Nothing but the worst news came to us from every side,--which is not to be wondered at, for if you look at the map you will see that we were right in the heart of it. Lucknow is rather better than a hundred miles to the east, and Cawnpore about as far to the south. From every point on the compass there was nothing but torture and murder and outrage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The city of Agra is a great place, swarming with fanatics and fierce devil-worshippers of all sorts. Our handful of men were lost among the narrow, winding streets. Our leader moved across the river, therefore, and took up his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) position in the old fort at Agra. I don't know if any of you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort. It is a very queer place,--the queerest that ever I was in, and I have been in some rum corners, too. First of all, it is enormous in size. I should think that the enclosure must be acres and acres. There is a modern part, which took all our garrison, women, children, stores, and everything else, with plenty of room over. But the modern part is nothing like the size of the old quarter, where nobody goes, and which is given over to the scorpions and the centipedes. It is all full of great deserted halls, and winding passages, and long corridors twisting in and out, so that it is easy enough for folk to get lost in it. For this reason it was seldom that any one went into it, though now and again a party with torches might go exploring. ''  (<font color='red'><b>troops</b></font>)</div>The river washes along the front of the old fort, and so protects it, but on the sides and behind there are many doors, and these had to be guarded, of course, in the old quarter as well as in that which was actually held by our troops. We were short-handed, with hardly men enough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns. It was impossible for us, therefore, to station a strong guard at every one of the innumerable gates.
<p/>What we did was to organize a central guard-house in the middle of the fort, and to leave each gate under the charge of one white man and two or three natives. I was selected to take charge during certain hours of the night of a small isolated door upon the southwest side of the building. Two Sikh troopers were placed under my command, and I was instructed if anything went wrong to fire my musket, when I might rely upon help coming at once from the central guard. As the guard was a good two hundred paces away, however, and as the space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages and corridors, I had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in time to be of any use in case of an actual attack. '' Well, I was pretty proud at having this small command given me, since I was a raw recruit, and a game-legged one at that. For two nights I kept the watch with my Punjaubees. They were tall, fierce-looking chaps, Mahomet Singh and Abdullah Khan by name, both old fighting-men who had borne arms against us at Chilian-wallah. They could talk English pretty well, but I could get little out of them. They preferred to stand together and jabber all night in their queer Sikh lingo. For myself, I used to stand outside the gate-way, looking down on the broad, winding river and on the twinkling lights of the great city. The beating of drums, the rattle of tomtoms, and the yells and howls of the rebels, drunk with opium and with bang, were enough to remind us all night of our dangerous neighbors across the stream.
<p/>Every two hours the officer of the night used to come round to all the posts, to make sure that all was well. ``The third night of my watch was dark and dirty, with a small, driving rain. It was dreary work standing in the gate-way hour after hour in such weather. I tried again and again to make my Sikhs talk, but without much success. At two in the morning the rounds passed, and broke for a moment the weariness of the night. Finding that my companions would not be led into conversation, I took out my pipe, and laid down my musket to strike the match. In an instant the two Sikhs were upon me. One of them snatched my firelock up and levelled it at my head, while the other held a great knife to my throat and swore between his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) teeth that he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) would plunge it into me if I moved a step. <div class="bookquote">``My first thought was that these fellows were in league with the rebels, and that this was the beginning of an assault. If our door were in the hands of the Sepoys the place must fall, and the women and children be treated as they were in Cawnpore. Maybe you gentlemen think that I am just making out a case for myself, but I give you my word that when I thought of that, though I felt the point of the knife at my throat, I opened my mouth with the intention of giving a scream, if it was my last one, which might alarm the main guard. The man who held me seemed to know my thoughts; for, even as I braced myself to it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whispered, `Don't make a noise. The fort is safe enough.
<p/>There are no rebel dogs on this side of the river.' There was the ring of truth in what he (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>) said, and I knew that if I raised my voice I was a dead man. I could read it in the fellow's brown eyes. I waited, therefore, in silence, to see what it was that they wanted from me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>`Listen to me, Sahib,' said the taller and fiercer of the pair, the one whom they called Abdullah Khan. ' You must either be with us now or you must be silenced forever. The thing is too great a one for us to hesitate. Either you are heart and soul with us on your oath on the cross of the Christians, or your body this night shall be thrown into the ditch and we shall pass over to our brothers in the rebel army. There is no middle way. Which is it to be, death or life? We can only give you three minutes to decide, for the time is passing, and all must be done before the rounds come again.' ''`How can I decide?' said I. `You have not told me what you want of me. But I tell you now that if it is anything against the safety of the fort I will have no truck with it, so you can drive home your knife and welcome.' ''`It is nothing against the fort,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). ' We only ask you to do that which your countrymen come to this land for. We ask you to be rich. If you will be one of us this night, we will swear to you upon the naked knife, and by the threefold oath which no Sikh was ever known to break, that you shall have your fair share of the loot.
<p/>A quarter of the treasure shall be yours. We can say no fairer.' ''`But what is the treasure, then?' I asked. 'I am as ready to be rich as you can be, if you will but show me how it can be done.' ''`You will swear, then,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikh</b></font>), `by the bones of your father, by the honor of your mother, by the cross of your faith, to raise no hand and speak no word against us, either now or afterwards?' '''I will swear it,' I answered, `provided that the fort is not endangered.' '' `Then my comrade and I will swear that you shall have a quarter of the treasure which shall be equally divided among the four of us.' '' `There are but three,' said I. ''' No; Dost Akbar must have his (<font color='blue'><b>Akbar</b></font>) share. We can tell the tale to you while we await them. Do you stand at the gate, Mahomet Singh, and give notice of their coming. The thing stands thus, Sahib, and I tell it to you because I know that an oath is binding upon a Feringhee, and that we may trust you. Had you been a lying Hindoo, though you had sworn by all the gods in their false temples, your blood would have been upon the knife, and your body in the water. But the Sikh knows the Englishman, and the Englishman knows the Sikh. Hearken, then, to what I have to say. ''`There is a rajah in the northern provinces who has much wealth, though his (<font color='blue'><b>rajah</b></font>) lands are small. Much has come to him (<font color='blue'><b>rajah</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>rajah</b></font>) father, and more still he (<font color='blue'><b>rajah</b></font>) has set by himself, for he (<font color='blue'><b>rajah</b></font>) is of a low nature and hoards his (<font color='blue'><b>rajah</b></font>) gold rather than spend it.
<p/>When the troubles broke out he (<font color='blue'><b>rajah</b></font>) would be friends both with the lion and the tiger,--with the Sepoy and with the Company's Raj. Soon, however, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raj</b></font>) that the white men's day was come, for through all the land he (<font color='blue'><b>Raj</b></font>) could hear of nothing but of their death and their overthrow. Yet, being a careful man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made such plans that, come what might, half at least of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) treasure should be left to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). That which was in gold and silver he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the vaults of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) palace, but the most precious stones and the choicest pearls that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put in an iron box, and sent it by a trusty servant who, under the guise of a merchant, should take it to the fort at Agra, there to lie until the land is at peace. Thus, if the rebels won he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) would have his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) money, but if the Company conquered his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) jewels would be saved to him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>). Having thus divided his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) hoard, he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) threw himself into the cause of the Sepoys, since they were strong upon his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) borders. By doing this, mark you, Sahib, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) property becomes the due of those who have been true to their salt. ''' This pretended merchant, who travels under the name of Achmet, is now in the city of Agra, and desires to gain his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) way into the fort. He (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) has with him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) as travelling-companion my foster-brother Dost Akbar, who knows his (<font color='blue'><b>Akbar</b></font>) secret. Dost Akbar has promised this night to lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Akbar</b></font>) to a side-postern of the fort, and has chosen this one for his (<font color='blue'><b>Akbar</b></font>) purpose. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Akbar</b></font>) will come presently, and here he (<font color='blue'><b>Akbar</b></font>) will find Mahomet Singh and myself awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Akbar</b></font>). The place is lonely, and none shall know of his (<font color='blue'><b>Akbar</b></font>) coming.
<p/>The world shall know of the merchant Achmet no more, but the great treasure of the rajah shall be divided among us. What say you to it, Sahib?' <div class="bookquote">``In Worcestershire the life of a man seems a great and a sacred thing; but it is very different when there is fire and blood all round you and you have been used to meeting death at every turn. Whether Achmet the merchant lived or died was a thing as light as air to me, but at the talk about the treasure my heart turned to it, and I thought of what I might do in the old country with it, and how my folk would stare when they saw their ne'er-do-well coming back with his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) pockets full of gold moidores. I had, therefore, already made up my mind. Abdullah Khan, however, thinking that I hesitated, pressed the matter more closely. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sahib</b></font>)</div>`Consider, Sahib,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>), `that if this man is taken by the commandant he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be hung or shot, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jewels taken by the government, so that no man will be a rupee the better for them. Now, since we do the taking of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), why should we not do the rest as well? The jewels will be as well with us as in the Company's coffers. There will be enough to make every one of us rich men and great chiefs. No one can know about the matter, for here we are cut off from all men. What could be better for the purpose? Say again, then, Sahib, whether you are with us, or if we must look upon you as an enemy.' '''I am with you heart and soul,' said I. ''' It is well,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) answered, handing me back my firelock. '
<p/>You see that we trust you, for your word, like ours, is not to be broken. We have now only to wait for my brother and the merchant.' ''`Does your brother know, then, of what you will do?' I asked. ''' The plan is his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has devised it. We will go to the gate and share the watch with Mahomet Singh.' <div class="bookquote">``The rain was still falling steadily, for it was just the beginning of the wet season. Brown, heavy clouds were drifting across the sky, and it was hard to see more than a stone-cast. A deep moat lay in front of our door, but the water was in places nearly dried up, and it could easily be crossed. It was strange to me to be standing there with those two wild Punjaubees waiting for the man who was coming to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) death. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Suddenly my eye caught the glint of a shaded lantern at the other side of the moat. It vanished among the mound-heaps, and then appeared again coming slowly in our direction. '' `Here they are!' I exclaimed. '' `You will challenge him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Sahib, as usual,' whispered Abdullah. ' Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) no cause for fear. Send us in with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>), and we shall do the rest while you stay here on guard. Have the lantern ready to uncover, that we may be sure that it is indeed the man.' <div class="bookquote">``The light had flickered onwards, now stopping and now advancing, until I could see two dark figures upon the other side of the moat. I let them scramble down the sloping bank, splash through the mire, and climb half-way up to the gate, before I challenged them. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>`Who goes there?' said I, in a subdued voice. '' `Friends,' came the answer.
<p/>I uncovered my lantern and threw a flood of light upon them. The first was an enormous Sikh, with a black beard which swept nearly down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikh</b></font>) cummerbund. Outside of a show I have never seen so tall a man. The other was a little, fat, round fellow, with a great yellow turban, and a bundle in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hand, done up in a shawl. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) seemed to be all in a quiver with fear, for his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hands twitched as if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had the ague, and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) head kept turning to left and right with two bright little twinkling eyes, like a mouse when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ventures out from his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hole. It gave me the chills to think of killing him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), but I thought of the treasure, and my heart set as hard as a flint within me. When he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) saw my white face he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) gave a little chirrup of joy and came running up towards me. '' ' Your protection, Sahib,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) panted,--`your protection for the unhappy merchant Achmet. I have travelled across Rajpootana that I might seek the shelter of the fort at Agra. I have been robbed and beaten and abused because I have been the friend of the Company. It is a blessed night this when I am once more in safety,--I and my poor possessions.' ''`What have you in the bundle?' I asked. ''' An iron box,' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) answered, `which contains one or two little family matters which are of no value to others, but which I should be sorry to lose. Yet I am not a beggar; and I shall reward you, young Sahib, and your governor also, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) will give me the shelter I ask.' <div class="bookquote">``I could not trust myself to speak longer with the man.
<p/>The more I looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fat, frightened face, the harder did it seem that we should slay him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in cold blood. It was best to get it over. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>`Take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the main guard,' said I. The two Sikhs closed in upon him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) on each side, and the giant walked behind, while they marched in through the dark gate-way. Never was a man so compassed round with death. I remained at the gate-way with the lantern. <div class="bookquote">``I could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps sounding through the lonely corridors. Suddenly it ceased, and I heard voices, and a scuffle, with the sound of blows. A moment later there came, to my horror, a rush of footsteps coming in my direction, with the loud breathing of a running man. I turned my lantern down the long, straight passage, and there was the fat man, running like the wind, with a smear of blood across his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, and close at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heels, bounding like a tiger, the great black-bearded Sikh, with a knife flashing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikh</b></font>) hand. I have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was gaining on the Sikh, and I could see that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikh</b></font>) once passed me and got to the open air he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikh</b></font>) would save himself yet. My heart softened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikh</b></font>), but again the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikh</b></font>) treasure turned me hard and bitter. I cast my firelock between his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikh</b></font>) legs as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikh</b></font>) raced past, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikh</b></font>) rolled twice over like a shot rabbit. Ere he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikh</b></font>) could stagger to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikh</b></font>) feet the Sikh was upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikh</b></font>), and buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikh</b></font>) knife twice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikh</b></font>) side. The man never uttered moan nor moved muscle, but lay were he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had fallen.
<p/>I think myself that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may have broken his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck with the fall. You see, gentlemen, that I am keeping my promise. I am telling you every work of the business just exactly as it happened, whether it is in my favor or not.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped, and held out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manacled hands for the whiskey-and-water which Holmes had brewed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). For myself, I confess that I had now conceived the utmost horror of the man, not only for this cold-blooded business in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been concerned, but even more for the somewhat flippant and careless way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) narrated it. Whatever punishment was in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might expect no sympathy from me. Sherlock Holmes and Jones sat with their hands upon their knees, deeply interested in the story, but with the same disgust written upon their faces. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) may have observed it, for there was a touch of defiance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) voice and manner as he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) proceeded. <div class="bookquote">``It was all very bad, no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I should like to know how many fellows in my shoes would have refused a share of this loot when they knew that they would have their throats cut for their pains. Besides, it was my life or his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) when once he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was in the fort. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) had got out, the whole business would come to light, and I should have been court-martialled and shot as likely as not; for people were not very lenient at a time like that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go on with your story,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, shortly. '' Well, we carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) in, Abdullah, Akbar, and I. A fine weight he (<font color='blue'><b>Akbar</b></font>) was, too, for all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Akbar</b></font>) was so short. Mahomet Singh was left to guard the door.
<p/>We took him (<font color='blue'><b>Singh</b></font>) to a place which the Sikhs had already prepared. It was some distance off, where a winding passage leads to a great empty hall, the brick walls of which were all crumbling to pieces. The earth floor had sunk in at one place, making a natural grave, so we left Achmet the merchant there, having first covered him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) over with loose bricks. This done, we all went back to the treasure. <div class="bookquote">``It lay where he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) had dropped it when he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) was first attacked. The box was the same which now lies open upon your table. A key was hung by a silken cord to that carved handle upon the top. We opened it, and the light of the lantern gleamed upon a collection of gems such as I have read of and thought about when I was a little lad at Pershore. It was blinding to look upon them. When we had feasted our eyes we took them all out and made a list of them. There were one hundred and forty-three diamonds of the first water, including one which has been called, I believe, `the Great Mogul' and is said to be the second largest stone in existence. Then there were ninety-seven very fine emeralds, and one hundred and seventy rubies, some of which, however, were small. There were forty carbuncles, two hundred and ten sapphires, sixty-one agates, and a great quantity of beryls, onyxes, cats'-eyes, turquoises, and other stones, the very names of which I did not know at the time, though I have become more familiar with them since. Besides this, there were nearly three hundred very fine pearls, twelve of which were set in a gold coronet.
<p/>By the way, these last had been taken out of the chest and were not there when I recovered it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mahomet Singh/Mahomet</b></font>)</div>After we had counted our treasures we put them back into the chest and carried them to the gate-way to show them to Mahomet Singh. Then we solemnly renewed our oath to stand by each other and be true to our secret. We agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the country should be at peace again, and then to divide it equally among ourselves. There was no use dividing it at present, for if gems of such value were found upon us it would cause suspicion, and there was no privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them. We carried the box, therefore, into the same hall where we had buried the body, and there, under certain bricks in the best-preserved wall, we made a hollow and put our treasure. We made careful note of the place, and next day I drew four plans, one for each of us, and put the sign of the four of us at the bottom, for we had sworn that we should each always act for all, so that none might take advantage. That is an oath that I can put my hand to my heart and swear that I have never broken. '' Well, there's no use my telling you gentlemen what came of the Indian mutiny. After Wilson took Delhi and Sir Colin relieved Lucknow the back of the business was broken. Fresh troops came pouring in, and Nana Sahib made himself scarce over the frontier. A flying column under Colonel Greathed came round to Agra and cleared the Pandies away from it.
<p/>Peace seemed to be settling upon the country, and we four were beginning to hope that the time was at hand when we might safely go off with our shares of the plunder. In a moment, however, our hopes were shattered by our being arrested as the murderers of Achmet. ``It came about in this way. When the rajah put his (<font color='blue'><b>rajah</b></font>) jewels into the hands of Achmet he (<font color='blue'><b>rajah</b></font>) did it because he (<font color='blue'><b>rajah</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>rajah</b></font>) was a trusty man. They are suspicious folk in the East, however: so what does this rajah do but take a second even more trusty servant and set him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) to play the spy upon the first? This second man was ordered never to let Achmet out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sight, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) like his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shadow. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that night and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pass through the doorway. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had taken refuge in the fort, and applied for admission there himself next day, but could find no trace of Achmet. This seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so strange that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke about it to a sergeant of guides, who brought it to the ears of the commandant. A thorough search was quickly made, and the body was discovered. Thus at the very moment that we thought that all was safe we were all four seized and brought to trial on a charge of murder,--three of us because we had held the gate that night, and the fourth because he (<font color='blue'><b>commandant</b></font>) was known to have been in the company of the murdered man. Not a word about the jewels came out at the trial, for the rajah had been deposed and driven out of India: so no one had any particular interest in them.
<p/>The murder, however, was clearly made out, and it was certain that we must all have been concerned in it. The three Sikhs got penal servitude for life, and I was condemned to death, though my sentence was afterwards commuted into the same as the others. <div class="bookquote">``It was rather a queer position that we found ourselves in then. There we were all four tied by the leg and with precious little chance of ever getting out again, while we each held a secret which might have put each of us in a palace if we could only have made use of it. It was enough to make a man eat his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart out to have to stand the kick and the cuff of every petty jack-in-office, to have rice to eat and water to drink, when that gorgeous fortune was ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) outside, just waiting to be picked up. It might have driven me mad; but I was always a pretty stubborn one, so I just held on and bided my time. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>At last it seemed to me to have come. I was changed from Agra to Madras, and from there to Blair Island in the Andamans. There are very few white convicts at this settlement, and, as I had behaved well from the first , I soon found myself a sort of privileged person. I was given a hut in Hope Town, which is a small place on the slopes of Mount Harriet, and I was left pretty much to myself. It is a dreary, fever-stricken place, and all beyond our little clearings was infested with wild cannibal natives, who were ready enough to blow a poisoned dart at us if they saw a chance.
<p/>There was digging, and ditching, and yam-planting, and a dozen other things to be done, so we were busy enough all day; though in the evening we had a little time to ourselves. Among other things, I learned to dispense drugs for the surgeon, and picked up a smattering of his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) knowledge. All the time I was on the lookout for a chance of escape; but it is hundreds of miles from any other land, and there is little or no wind in those seas: so it was a terribly difficult job to get away. '' The surgeon, Dr. Somerton, was a fast, sporting young chap, and the other young officers would meet in his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) rooms of an evening and play cards. The surgery, where I used to make up my drugs, was next to his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) sitting-room, with a small window between us. Often, if I felt lonesome, I used to turn out the lamp in the surgery, and then, standing there, I could hear their talk and watch their play. I am fond of a hand at cards myself, and it was almost as good as having one to watch the others. There was Major Sholto, Captain Morstan, and Lieutenant Bromley Brown, who were in command of the native troops, and there was the surgeon himself, and two or three prison-officials, crafty old hands who played a nice sly safe game. A very snug little party they used to make. '' Well, there was one thing which very soon struck me, and that was that the soldiers used always to lose and the civilians to win. Mind, I don't say that there was anything unfair, but so it was.
<p/>These prison-chaps had done little else than play cards ever since they had been at the Andamans, and they knew each other's game to a point, while the others just played to pass the time and threw their cards down anyhow. Night after night the soldiers got up poorer men, and the poorer they got the more keen they were to play. Major Sholto was the hardest hit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) used to pay in notes and gold at first, but soon it came to notes of hand and for big sums. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) sometimes would win for a few deals, just to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) heart, and then the luck would set in against him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) worse than ever. All day he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) would wander about as black as thunder, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) took to drinking a deal more than was good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>). '' One night he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) lost even more heavily than usual. I was sitting in my hut when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) and Captain Morstan came stumbling along on the way to their quarters. They were bosom friends, those two, and never far apart. The major was raving about his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) losses. '' `It's all up, Morstan,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) was saying, as they passed my hut. ' I shall have to send in my papers. I am a ruined man.' ''`Nonsense, old chap!' said the other, slapping him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) upon the shoulder. ' I've had a nasty facer myself, but--' That was all I could hear, but it was enough to set me thinking. <div class="bookquote">``A couple of days later Major Sholto was strolling on the beach: so I took the chance of speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'I wish to have your advice, major,' said I. ''' Well, Small, what is it?' he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) asked, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) cheroot from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) lips. ''
<p/>'I wanted to ask you, sir,' said I, `who is the proper person to whom hidden treasure should be handed over. I know where half a million worth lies, and, as I cannot use it myself, I thought perhaps the best thing that I could do would be to hand it over to the proper authorities, and then perhaps they would get my sentence shortened for me.' ''`Half a million, Small?' he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) gasped, looking hard at me to see if I was in earnest. '' `Quite that, sir,--in jewels and pearls. It lies there ready for any one. And the queer thing about it is that the real owner is outlawed and cannot hold property, so that it belongs to the first comer.' '' `To government, Small,' he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) stammered,--`to government.' But he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) said it in a halting fashion, and I knew in my heart that I had got him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>). '' `You think, then, sir, that I should give the information to the Governor-General?' said I, quietly. '' `Well, well, you must not do anything rash, or that you might repent. Let me hear all about it, Small. Give me the facts.' <div class="bookquote">``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Governor-General</b></font>) the whole story, with small changes so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Governor-General</b></font>) could not identify the places. When I had finished he (<font color='blue'><b>Governor-General</b></font>) stood stock still and full of thought. I could see by the twitch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor-General</b></font>) lip that there was a struggle going on within him (<font color='blue'><b>Governor-General</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>`This is a very important matter, Small,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Governor-General</b></font>) said, at last. ' You must not say a word to any one about it, and I shall see you again soon.' <div class="bookquote">``Two nights later he (<font color='blue'><b>Governor-General</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor-General</b></font>) friend Captain Morstan came to my hut in the dead of the night with a lantern. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'I want you just to let Captain Morstan hear that story from your own lips, Small,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I repeated it as I had told it before. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>`It rings true, eh?' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). ' It's good enough to act upon?' <div class="bookquote">``Captain Morstan nodded. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>`Look here, Small,' said the major. ' We have been talking it over, my friend here and I, and we have come to the conclusion that this secret of yours is hardly a government matter, after all, but is a private concern of your own, which of course you have the power of disposing of as you think best. Now, the question is, what price would you ask for it? We might be inclined to take it up, and at least look into it, if we could agree as to terms.' He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) tried to speak in a cool, careless way, but his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyes were shining with excitement and greed. '' `Why, as to that, gentlemen,' I answered, trying also to be cool, but feeling as excited as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did, `there is only one bargain which a man in my position can make. I shall want you to help me to my freedom, and to help my three companions to theirs. We shall then take you into partnership, and give you a fifth share to divide between you.' ''`Hum!' said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). 'A fifth share! That is not very tempting.' ''`It would come to fifty thousand apiece,' said I. ''' But how can we gain your freedom? You know very well that you ask an impossibility.' ''`Nothing of the sort,' I answered. 'I have thought it all out to the last detail.
<p/>The only bar to our escape is that we can get no boat fit for the voyage, and no provisions to last us for so long a time. There are plenty of little yachts and yawls at Calcutta or Madras which would serve our turn well. Do you bring one over. We shall engage to get aboard her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) by night, and if you will drop us on any part of the Indian coast you will have done your part of the bargain.' ''`If there were only one,' he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) said. ''`None or all,' I answered. `We have sworn it. The four of us must always act together.' ''`You see, Morstan,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>), `Small is a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) word. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not flinch from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend. I think we may very well trust him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).' ''`It's a dirty business,' the other answered. ' Yet, as you say, the money would save our commissions handsomely.' ''`Well, Small,' said the major, `we must, I suppose, try and meet you. We must first, of course, test the truth of your story. Tell me where the box is hid, and I shall get leave of absence and go back to India in the monthly relief-boat to inquire into the affair.' ''`Not so fast,' said I, growing colder as he (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) got hot. ' I must have the consent of my three comrades. I tell you that it is four or none with us.' ''`Nonsense!' he (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) broke in. ' What have three black fellows to do with our agreement?' ''`Black or blue,' said I, `they are in with me, and we all go together.' '' Well, the matter ended by a second meeting, at which Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, and Dost Akbar were all present.
<p/>We talked the matter over again, and at last we came to an arrangement. We were to provide both the officers with charts of the part of the Agra fort and mark the place in the wall where the treasure was hid. Major Sholto was to go to India to test our story. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) found the box he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) was to leave it there, to send out a small yacht provisioned for a voyage, which was to lie off Rutland Island, and to which we were to make our way, and finally to return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) duties. Captain Morstan was then to apply for leave of absence, to meet us at Agra, and there we were to have a final division of the treasure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) taking the major's share as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) own. All this we sealed by the most solemn oaths that the mind could think or the lips utter. I sat up all night with paper and ink, and by the morning I had the two charts all ready, signed with the sign of four,--that is, of Abdullah, Akbar, Mahomet, and myself. '' Well, gentlemen, I weary you with my long story, and I know that my friend Mr. Jones is impatient to get me safely stowed in chokey. I'll make it as short as I can. The villain Sholto went off to India, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) never came back again. Captain Morstan showed me his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) name among a list of passengers in one of the mail-boats very shortly afterwards. His (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) uncle had died, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) a fortune, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had left the army, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) could stoop to treat five men as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had treated us. Morstan went over to Agra shortly afterwards, and found, as we expected, that the treasure was indeed gone.
<p/>The scoundrel had stolen it all, without carrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) the secret. From that day I lived only for vengeance. I thought of it by day and I nursed it by night. It became an overpowering, absorbing passion with me. I cared nothing for the law,--nothing for the gallows. To escape, to track down Sholto, to have my hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) throat,--that was my one thought. Even the Agra treasure had come to be a smaller thing in my mind than the slaying of Sholto. '' Well, I have set my mind on many things in this life, and never one which I did not carry out. But it was weary years before my time came. I have told you that I had picked up something of medicine. One day when Dr. Somerton was down with a fever a little Andaman Islander was picked up by a convict-gang in the woods. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) was sick to death, and had gone to a lonely place to die. I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) in hand, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) was as venomous as a young snake, and after a couple of months I got him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) all right and able to walk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) took a kind of fancy to me then, and would hardly go back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) woods, but was always hanging about my hut. I learned a little of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) lingo from him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>), and this made him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) all the fonder of me. '' Tonga--for that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) name--was a fine boatman, and owned a big, roomy canoe of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) own. When I found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) was devoted to me and would do anything to serve me, I saw my chance of escape. I talked it over with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) was to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) boat round on a certain night to an old wharf which was never guarded, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) was to pick me up. I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) directions to have several gourds of water and a lot of yams, cocoa-nuts, and sweet potatoes. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) was stanch and true, was little Tonga. No man ever had a more faithful mate. At the night named he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) boat at the wharf. As it chanced, however, there was one of the convict-guard down there,--a vile Pathan who had never missed a chance of insulting and injuring me. I had always vowed vengeance, and now I had my chance. It was as if fate had placed him (<font color='blue'><b>Pathan</b></font>) in my way that I might pay my debt before I left the island. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pathan</b></font>) stood on the bank with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pathan</b></font>) back to me, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pathan</b></font>) carbine on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pathan</b></font>) shoulder. I looked about for a stone to beat out his (<font color='blue'><b>Pathan</b></font>) brains with, but none could I see. Then a queer thought came into my head and showed me where I could lay my hand on a weapon. I sat down in the darkness and unstrapped my wooden leg. With three long hops I was on him (<font color='blue'><b>Pathan</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Pathan</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Pathan</b></font>) carbine to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pathan</b></font>) shoulder, but I struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Pathan</b></font>) full, and knocked the whole front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pathan</b></font>) skull in. You can see the split in the wood now where I hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Pathan</b></font>). We both went down together, for I could not keep my balance, but when I got up I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Pathan</b></font>) still lying quiet enough. I made for the boat, and in an hour we were well out at sea. Tonga had brought all his (<font color='blue'><b>Pathan</b></font>) earthly possessions with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pathan</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Pathan</b></font>) arms and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pathan</b></font>) gods.
<p/>Among other things, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pathan</b></font>) had a long bamboo spear, and some Andaman cocoa-nut matting, with which I made a sort of sail. For ten days we were beating about, trusting to luck, and on the eleventh we were picked up by a trader which was going from Singapore to Jiddah with a cargo of Malay pilgrims. They were a rum crowd, and Tonga and I soon managed to settle down among them. They had one very good quality: they let you alone and asked no questions. '' Well, if I were to tell you all the adventures that my little chum and I went through , you would not thank me, for I would have you here until the sun was shining. Here and there we drifted about the world, something always turning up to keep us from London. All the time, however, I never lost sight of my purpose. I would dream of Sholto at night. A hundred times I have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in my sleep. At last, however, some three or four years ago, we found ourselves in England. I had no great difficulty in finding where Sholto lived, and I set to work to discover whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) had realized the treasure, or if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) still had it. I made friends with someone who could help me,--I name no names, for I don't want to get any one else in a hole,--and I soon found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) still had the jewels. Then I tried to get at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) in many ways; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) was pretty sly, and had always two prize-fighters, besides his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) sons and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) khitmutgar, on guard over him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>). ``One day, however, I got word that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) was dying.
<p/>I hurried at once to the garden, mad that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) should slip out of my clutches like that, and, looking through the window, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) lying in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) bed, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) sons on each side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>). I'd have come through and taken my chance with the three of them, only even as I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) jaw dropped, and I knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) was gone. I got into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) room that same night, though, and I searched his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) papers to see if there was any record of where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) had hidden our jewels. There was not a line, however: so I came away, bitter and savage as a man could be. Before I left I bethought me that if I ever met my Sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to know that I had left some mark of our hatred: so I scrawled down the sign of the four of us, as it had been on the chart, and I pinned it on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bosom. It was too much that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be taken to the grave without some token from the men whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had robbed and befooled. ``We earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor Tonga at fairs and other such places as the black cannibal. He (<font color='blue'><b>cannibal</b></font>) would eat raw meat and dance his (<font color='blue'><b>cannibal</b></font>) war-dance: so we always had a hatful of pennies after a day's work. I still heard all the news from Pondicherry Lodge, and for some years there was no news to hear, except that they were hunting for the treasure. At last, however, came what we had waited for so long. The treasure had been found. It was up at the top of the house, in Mr. Bartholomew Sholto's chemical laboratory.
<p/>I came at once and had a look at the place, but I could not see how with my wooden leg I was to make my way up to it. I learned, however, about a trap-door in the roof, and also about Mr. Sholto's supper-hour. It seemed to me that I could manage the thing easily through Tonga. I brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) out with me with a long rope wound round his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) waist. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) could climb like a cat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) soon made his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) way through the roof, but, as ill luck would have it, Bartholomew Sholto was still in the room, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) cost. Tonga thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) had done something very clever in killing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>), for when I came up by the rope I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) strutting about as proud as a peacock. Very much surprised was he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) when I made at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) with the rope's end and cursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) for a little blood-thirsty imp. I took the treasure-box and let it down, and then slid down myself, having first left the sign of the four upon the table, to show that the jewels had come back at last to those who had most right to them. Tonga then pulled up the rope, closed the window, and made off the way that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) had come. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know that I have anything else to tell you. I had heard a waterman speak of the speed of Smith's launch the Aurora, so I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) would be a handy craft for our escape. I engaged with old Smith, and was to give him (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>) a big sum if he (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>) got us safe to our ship. He (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>) knew, no doubt, that there was some screw loose, but he (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>) was not in our secrets.
<p/>All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you, gentlemen, it is not to amuse you,--for you have not done me a very good turn,--but it is because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold back nothing, but let all the world know how badly I have myself been served by Major Sholto, and how innocent I am of the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sholto</b></font>) son.''
