'' ","i":884},{"w":"`` Well , it was this way , '' ","i":914},{"w":"`` I was coming home from some place at the end of the world , about three o'clock of a black winter morning , and my way lay through a part of town where there was literally nothing to be seen but lamps . Street after street and all the folks asleep -- street after street , all lighted up as if for a procession and all as empty as a church -- till at last I got into that state of mind when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a policeman . All at once , I saw two figures : one a little man who was stumping along eastward at a good walk , and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross street . Well , sir , the two ran into one another naturally enough at the corner ; and then came the horrible part of the thing ; for the man trampled calmly over the child 's body and left her screaming on the ground . It sounds nothing to hear , but it was hellish to see . It was n't like a man ; it was like some damned Juggernaut . I gave a few halloa , took to my heels , collared my gentleman , and brought him back to where there was already quite a group about the screaming child . He was perfectly cool and made no resistance , but gave me one look , so ugly that it brought out the sweat on me like running . The people who had turned out were the girl 's own family ; and pretty soon , the doctor , for whom she had been sent put in his appearance . Well , the child was not much the worse , more frightened , according to the Sawbones ; and there you might have supposed would be an end to it . But there was one curious circumstance . I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first sight . So had the child 's family , which was only natural . But the doctor 's case was what struck me . He was the usual cut and dry apothecary , of no particular age and colour , with a strong Edinburgh accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe . Well , sir , he was like the rest of us ; every time he looked at my prisoner , I saw that Sawbones turn sick and white with desire to kill him . I knew what was in his mind , just as he knew what was in mine ; and killing being out of the question , we did the next best . We told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end of London to the other . If he had any friends or any credit , we undertook that he should lose them . And all the time , as we were pitching it in red hot , we were keeping the women off him as best we could for they were as wild as harpies . I never saw a circle of such hateful faces ; and there was the man in the middle , with a kind of black sneering coolness -- frightened too , I could see that -- but carrying it off , sir , really like Satan . ` If you choose to make capital out of this accident , ' said he , ` I am naturally helpless . No gentleman but wishes to avoid a scene , ' says he . ` Name your figure . ' Well , we screwed him up to a hundred pounds for the child 's family ; he would have clearly liked to stick out ; but there was something about the lot of us that meant mischief , and at last he struck . The next thing was to get the money ; and where do you think he carried us but to that place with the door ? -- whipped out a key , went in , and presently came back with the matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts 's , drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I ca n't mention , though it 's one of the points of my story , but it was a name at least very well known and often printed . The figure was stiff ; but the signature was good for more than that if it was only genuine . I took the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business looked apocryphal , and that a man does not , in real life , walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man 's cheque for close upon a hundred pounds . But he was quite easy and sneering . ` Set your mind at rest , ' says he , ` I will stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myself . ' So we all set off , the doctor , and the child 's father , and our friend and myself , and passed the rest of the night in my chambers ; and next day , when we had breakfasted , went in a body to the bank . I gave in the cheque myself , and said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery . Not a bit of it . The cheque was genuine .
