Home Again Introduction Folklore, legends, myths and fairy tales have followed childhood through the ages, for every healthy youngster has a wholesome and instinctive love for stories fantastic, marvelous and manifestly unreal. The winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations. Yet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be classed as <div class="bookquote">``historical''  (<font color='red'><b>generations</b></font>)</div>in the children's library; for the time has come for a series of newer <div class="bookquote">``wonder tales''  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>in which the stereotyped genie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to each tale. Modern education includes morality; therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident.
<p/>Having this thought in mind, the story of <div class="bookquote">``The Wonderful Wizard of Oz''  (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div>was written solely to please children of today. It aspires to being a modernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out. L. Frank Baum Chicago, April, 1900. THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ 1. The Cyclone Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar--except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole. When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks running through it.
<p/>Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else. When Aunt Em came there to live she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was a young, pretty wife. The sun and wind had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>), too. They had taken the sparkle from her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) cheeks and lips, and they were gray also. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was thin and gaunt, and never smiled now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>), Aunt Em had been so startled by the child's laughter that she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) would scream and press her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) ears; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) still looked at the little girl with wonder that she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) could find anything to laugh at. Uncle Henry never laughed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was gray also, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) long beard to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) rough boots, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke. It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) from growing as gray as her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) was a little black dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>), and loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) dearly. Today, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than usual.
<p/>Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) arms, and looked at the sky too. Aunt Em was washing the dishes. From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also. Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up. <div class="bookquote">``There's a cyclone coming, Em,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) called to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go look after the stock.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses were kept. Aunt Em dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) work and came to the door. One glance told her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) of the danger close at hand. '' Quick, Dorothy! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) screamed. <div class="bookquote">``Run for the cellar!''  (<font color='red'><b>Toto</b></font>)</div>Toto jumped out of Dorothy's arms and hid under the bed, and the girl started to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>). Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole. Dorothy caught Toto at last and started to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) aunt. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind, and the house shook so hard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor. Then a strange thing happened. The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air. Dorothy felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) were going up in a balloon. The north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the exact center of the cyclone.
<p/>In the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top of the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather. It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), but Dorothy found she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was riding quite easily. After the first few whirls around, and one other time when the house tipped badly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) were being rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle. Toto did not like it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) ran about the room, now here, now there, barking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would happen. Once Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first the little girl thought she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had lost him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>). But soon she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saw one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) ears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) up so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) could not fall. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) crept to the hole, caught Toto by the ear, and dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) into the room again, afterward closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen. Hour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) fright; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) nearly became deaf. At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) had wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring.
<p/>At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) crawled over the swaying floor to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) bed, and lay down upon it; and Toto followed and lay down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind, Dorothy soon closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) eyes and fell fast asleep. 2. The Council with the Munchkins She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) might have been hurt. As it was, the jar made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) breath and wonder what had happened; and Toto put his (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) cold little nose into her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) face and whined dismally. Dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the little room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) sprang from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) bed and with Toto at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) heels ran and opened the door. The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saw. The cyclone had set the house down very gently--for a cyclone--in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty. There were lovely patches of greensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits. Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes. A little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between green banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies. While she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) noticed coming toward her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a group of the queerest people she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had ever seen.
<p/>They were not as big as the grown folk she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had always been used to; but neither were they very small. In fact, they seemed about as tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) age, although they were, so far as looks go, many years older. Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The hats of the men were blue; the little woman's hat was white, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shoulders. Over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds. The men were dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men, Dorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had beards. But the little woman was doubtless much older. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face was covered with wrinkles, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair was nearly white, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) walked rather stiffly. When these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the doorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to come farther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low bow and said, in a sweet voice: <div class="bookquote">``You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins. We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the East, and for setting our people free from bondage. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder.
<p/>What could the little woman possibly mean by calling her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a sorceress, and saying she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had killed the Wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) had never killed anything in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) life. But the little woman evidently expected her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to answer; so Dorothy said, with hesitation, <div class="bookquote">``You are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I have not killed anything.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your house did, anyway,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replied the little old woman, with a laugh, <div class="bookquote">``and that is the same thing. See! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) continued, pointing to the corner of the house. <div class="bookquote">``There are her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) two feet, still sticking out from under a block of wood. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>Dorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There, indeed, just under the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were sticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes. '' Oh, dear! Oh, dear! '' cried Dorothy, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) hands together in dismay. <div class="bookquote">``The house must have fallen on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). Whatever shall we do?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There is nothing to be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the little woman calmly. <div class="bookquote">``But who was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,'' answered the little woman. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years, making them slave for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) night and day. Now they are all set free, and are grateful to you for the favor.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who are the Munchkins?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>inquired Dorothy. <div class="bookquote">``They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked Witch ruled.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you a Munchkin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy. '' No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.
<p/>When they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift messenger to me, and I came at once. I am the Witch of the North.'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, gracious! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>cried Dorothy. <div class="bookquote">``Are you a real witch?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>answered the little woman. <div class="bookquote">``But I am a good witch, and the people love me. I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who ruled here, or I should have set the people free myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I thought all witches were wicked,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, who was half frightened at facing a real witch. '' Oh, no, that is a great mistake. There were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them, those who live in the North and the South, are good witches. I know this is true, for I am one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken. Those who dwelt in the East and the West were, indeed, wicked witches; but now that you have killed one of them, there is but one Wicked Witch in all the Land of Oz--the one who lives in the West.'' <div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy, after a moment's thought, <div class="bookquote">``Aunt Em has told me that the witches were all dead--years and years ago.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who is Aunt Em? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>inquired the little old woman. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Witch</b></font>)</div>The Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) head bowed and her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) eyes upon the ground. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) looked up and said, <div class="bookquote">``I do not know where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned before. But tell me, is it a civilized country?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>replied Dorothy. '' Then that accounts for it.
<p/>In the civilized countries I believe there are no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians. But, you see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off from all the rest of the world. Therefore we still have witches and wizards amongst us.'' <div class="bookquote">``Who are the wizards? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy. '' Oz himself is the Great Wizard,'' answered the Witch, sinking her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) voice to a whisper. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) is more powerful than all the rest of us together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) lives in the City of Emeralds. '' Dorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins, who had been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the corner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying. <div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to laugh. The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing was left but the silver shoes. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) was so old,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>explained the Witch of the North, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) dried up quickly in the sun. That is the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>). But the silver shoes are yours, and you shall have them to wear.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) reached down and picked up the shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to Dorothy. <div class="bookquote">``The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Munchkins</b></font>)</div>said one of the Munchkins, <div class="bookquote">``and there is some charm connected with them; but what it is we never knew. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Munchkins</b></font>)</div>Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) came out again to the Munchkins and said: <div class="bookquote">``I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will worry about me. Can you help me find my way?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Munchkins</b></font>)</div><p/>The Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at Dorothy, and then shook their heads. '' At the East, not far from here,'' said one, <div class="bookquote">``there is a great desert, and none could live to cross it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is the same at the South,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said another, <div class="bookquote">``for I have been there and seen it. The South is the country of the Quadlings.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am told,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the third man, <div class="bookquote">``that it is the same at the West. And that country, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the Wicked Witch of the West, who would make you her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) slave if you passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) way.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The North is my home,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, <div class="bookquote">``and at its edge is the same great desert that surrounds this Land of Oz. I'm afraid, my dear, you will have to live with us.''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>Dorothy began to sob at this, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) felt lonely among all these strange people. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins, for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also. As for the little old woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cap and balanced the point on the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nose, while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) counted <div class="bookquote">``One, two, three''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in a solemn voice. At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was written in big, white chalk marks: <div class="bookquote">``LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS''  (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div>The little old woman took the slate from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nose, and having read the words on it, asked, <div class="bookquote">``Is your name Dorothy, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>answered the child, looking up and drying her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) tears. <div class="bookquote">``Then you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will help you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where is this city? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the Great Wizard I told you of.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) a good man?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>inquired the girl anxiously. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) is a good Wizard. Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) is a man or not I cannot tell, for I have never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How can I get there? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy. <div class="bookquote">``You must walk. It is a long journey, through a country that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will use all the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Won't you go with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon the little old woman as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only friend. '' No, I cannot do that,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``but I will give you my kiss, and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of the North.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) came close to Dorothy and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) gently on the forehead. Where her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy found out soon after. <div class="bookquote">``The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch, <div class="bookquote">``so you cannot miss it. When you get to Oz do not be afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>), but tell your story and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) to help you. Good-bye, my dear. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>The three Munchkins bowed low to her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) and wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) a pleasant journey, after which they walked away through the trees. The Witch gave Dorothy a friendly little nod, whirled around on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) left heel three times, and straightway disappeared, much to the surprise of little Toto, who barked after her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) loudly enough when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) had gone, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) had been afraid even to growl while she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) stood by.
<p/>But Dorothy, knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) to be a witch, had expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) to disappear in just that way, and was not surprised in the least. 3. How Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow When Dorothy was left alone she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) began to feel hungry. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) went to the cupboard and cut herself some bread, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) spread with butter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) carried it down to the little brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water. Toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting there. Dorothy went to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>), and saw such delicious fruit hanging from the branches that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) gathered some of it, finding it just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) wanted to help out her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) breakfast. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to a good drink of the cool, clear water, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) set about making ready for the journey to the City of Emeralds. Dorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was hanging on a peg beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) bed. It was gingham, with checks of white and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings, it was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pink sunbonnet on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feet and noticed how old and worn her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoes were. <div class="bookquote">``They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said. And Toto looked up into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) little black eyes and wagged his (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) tail to show he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) meant.
<p/>At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the Witch of the East. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder if they will fit me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) said to Toto. <div class="bookquote">``They would be just the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which fitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) as well as if they had been made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). Finally she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) picked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) basket. '' Come along, Toto,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We will go to the Emerald City and ask the Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) dress. And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) started on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) journey. There were several roads nearby, but it did not take her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) long to find the one paved with yellow bricks. Within a short time she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was walking briskly toward the Emerald City, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard, yellow road-bed. The sun shone bright and the birds sang sweetly, and Dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own country and set down in the midst of a strange land. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was surprised, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) walked along, to see how pretty the country was about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). There were neat fences at the sides of the road, painted a dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and vegetables in abundance. Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and able to raise large crops.
<p/>Once in a while she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would pass a house, and the people came out to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and bow low as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went by; for everyone knew she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and setting them free from bondage. The houses of the Munchkins were odd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof. All were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the favorite color. Toward evening, when Dorothy was tired with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) long walk and began to wonder where she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) should pass the night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) came to a house rather larger than the rest. On the green lawn before it many men and women were dancing. Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible, and the people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was loaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other good things to eat. The people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) to supper and to pass the night with them; for this was the home of one of the richest Munchkins in the land, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) friends were gathered with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) to celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the Wicked Witch. Dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin himself, whose name was Boq. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) sat upon a settee and watched the people dance. When Boq saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) silver shoes he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You must be a great sorceress.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>asked the girl. '' Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch. Besides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses wear white.'' <div class="bookquote">``My dress is blue and white checked,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy, smoothing out the wrinkles in it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is kind of you to wear that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Boq</b></font>)</div>said Boq. <div class="bookquote">``Blue is the color of the Munchkins, and white is the witch color. So we know you are a friendly witch. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>Dorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed to think her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) a witch, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) knew very well she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was only an ordinary little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) into the house, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Boq</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) a room with a pretty bed in it. The sheets were made of blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning, with Toto curled up on the blue rug beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee Munchkin baby, who played with Toto and pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) tail and crowed and laughed in a way that greatly amused Dorothy. Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people, for they had never seen a dog before. <div class="bookquote">``How far is it to the Emerald City?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl asked. <div class="bookquote">``I do not know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Boq</b></font>)</div>answered Boq gravely, <div class="bookquote">``for I have never been there. It is better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have business with him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>). But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it will take you many days. The country here is rich and pleasant, but you must pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your journey.''  (<font color='red'><b>Boq</b></font>)</div>This worried Dorothy a little, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) knew that only the Great Oz could help her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) get to Kansas again, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) bravely resolved not to turn back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) friends good-bye, and again started along the road of yellow brick.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) had gone several miles she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) would stop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far away she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn. Dorothy leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) chin upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) hand and gazed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes, nose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) head, and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded, which had also been stuffed with straw. On the feet were some old boots with blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back. While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the Scarecrow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) must have been mistaken at first, for none of the scarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its head to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) in a friendly way. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) climbed down from the fence and walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked. '' Good day,'' said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice. <div class="bookquote">``Did you speak?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>asked the girl, in wonder. '' Certainly,'' answered the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``How do you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm pretty well, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>replied Dorothy politely. <div class="bookquote">``How do you do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not feeling well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow, with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can't you get down?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy. '' No, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away the pole I shall be greatly obliged to you. '' Dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for, being stuffed with straw, it was quite light. '' Thank you very much,'' said the Scarecrow, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) had been set down on the ground. <div class="bookquote">``I feel like a new man. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>Dorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man speak, and to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bow and walk along beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Who are you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>asked the Scarecrow when he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) had stretched himself and yawned. '' And where are you going?'' <div class="bookquote">``My name is Dorothy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, <div class="bookquote">``and I am going to the Emerald City, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas.''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where is the Emerald City?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) inquired. <div class="bookquote">``And who is Oz?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, don't you know? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) returned, in surprise. '' No, indeed. I don't know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I have no brains at all,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) answered sadly. '' Oh,'' said Dorothy, <div class="bookquote">``I'm awfully sorry for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you think,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``if I go to the Emerald City with you, that Oz would give me some brains?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``but you may come with me, if you like. If Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you are now.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) continued confidentially, <div class="bookquote">``I don't mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed, because I cannot get hurt. If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin into me, it doesn't matter, for I can't feel it. But I do not want people to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw instead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I understand how you feel,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the little girl, who was truly sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``If you will come with me I'll ask Oz to do all he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) can for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) answered gratefully. They walked back to the road. Dorothy helped him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) over the fence, and they started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City. Toto did not like this addition to the party at first. He (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) smelled around the stuffed man as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) suspected there might be a nest of rats in the straw, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) often growled in an unfriendly way at the Scarecrow. '' Don't mind Toto,'' said Dorothy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) new friend. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) never bites.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm not afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>replied the Scarecrow. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) can't hurt the straw. Do let me carry that basket for you. I shall not mind it, for I can't get tired. I'll tell you a secret,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) continued, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) walked along. <div class="bookquote">``There is only one thing in the world I am afraid of.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy; <div class="bookquote">``the Munchkin farmer who made you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>answered the Scarecrow; <div class="bookquote">``it's a lighted match. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>4. The Road Through the Forest After a few hours the road began to be rough, and the walking grew so difficult that the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks, which were here very uneven.
<p/>Sometimes, indeed, they were broken or missing altogether, leaving holes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy walked around. As for the Scarecrow, having no brains, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) walked straight ahead, and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length on the hard bricks. It never hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>), however, and Dorothy would pick him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) up and set him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) feet again, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) in laughing merrily at his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) own mishap. The farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther back. There were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees, and the farther they went the more dismal and lonesome the country became. At noon they sat down by the roadside, near a little brook, and Dorothy opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) basket and got out some bread. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) offered a piece to the Scarecrow, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) refused. <div class="bookquote">``I am never hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and it is a lucky thing I am not, for my mouth is only painted, and if I should cut a hole in it so I could eat, the straw I am stuffed with would come out, and that would spoil the shape of my head. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Dorothy saw at once that this was true, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) only nodded and went on eating her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) bread. '' Tell me something about yourself and the country you came from,'' said the Scarecrow, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) dinner. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) all about Kansas, and how gray everything was there, and how the cyclone had carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) to this queer Land of Oz. The Scarecrow listened carefully, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot understand why you should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry, gray place you call Kansas.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is because you have no brains''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>answered the girl. ''
<p/>No matter how dreary and gray our homes are, we people of flesh and blood would rather live there than in any other country, be it ever so beautiful. There is no place like home. '' The Scarecrow sighed. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I cannot understand it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If your heads were stuffed with straw, like mine, you would probably all live in the beautiful places, and then Kansas would have no people at all. It is fortunate for Kansas that you have brains.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Won't you tell me a story, while we are resting?''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>asked the child. The Scarecrow looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) reproachfully, and answered: <div class="bookquote">``My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever. I was only made day before yesterday. What happened in the world before that time is all unknown to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one of the first things he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what was going on. There was another Munchkin with him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>), and the first thing I heard was the farmer saying, `How do you like those ears?' ''  (<font color='red'><b>The Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>`They aren't straight,''' answered the other. ''`Never mind,''' said the farmer. ''`They are ears just the same,''' which was true enough. '' `Now I'll make the eyes,''' said the farmer. So he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) painted my right eye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) and at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my first glimpse of the world. '' `That's a rather pretty eye,''' remarked the Munchkin who was watching the farmer. '' `Blue paint is just the color for eyes.' '''I think I'll make the other a little bigger,''' said the farmer.
<p/>And when the second eye was done I could see much better than before. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) made my nose and my mouth. But I did not speak, because at that time I didn't know what a mouth was for. I had the fun of watching them make my body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at last, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a man as anyone. '' `This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,' said the farmer. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) looks just like a man.' ''`Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) is a man,' said the other, and I quite agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>). The farmer carried me under his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a tall stick, where you found me. He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) friend soon after walked away and left me alone. <div class="bookquote">``I did not like to be deserted this way. So I tried to walk after them. But my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay on that pole. It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think of, having been made such a little while before. Many crows and other birds flew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew away again, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and made me feel that I was quite an important person. By and by an old crow flew near me, and after looking at me carefully he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) perched upon my shoulder and said: '' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner. Any crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.'
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) wanted. The other birds, seeing he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so in a short time there was a great flock of them about me. <div class="bookquote">``I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow after all; but the old crow comforted me, saying, `If you only had brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a better man than some of them. Brains are the only things worth having in this world, no matter whether one is a crow or a man.' ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>After the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try hard to get some brains. By good luck you came along and pulled me off the stake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me brains as soon as we get to the Emerald City.'' <div class="bookquote">``I hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy earnestly, <div class="bookquote">``since you seem anxious to have them.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes; I am anxious,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>returned the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``It is such an uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, <div class="bookquote">``let us go.''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) handed the basket to the Scarecrow. There were no fences at all by the roadside now, and the land was rough and untilled. Toward evening they came to a great forest, where the trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the road of yellow brick. It was almost dark under the trees, for the branches shut out the daylight; but the travelers did not stop, and went on into the forest.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If this road goes in, it must come out,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow, <div class="bookquote">``and as the Emerald City is at the other end of the road, we must go wherever it leads us.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Anyone would know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy. '' Certainly; that is why I know it,'' returned the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``If it required brains to figure it out, I never should have said it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>After an hour or so the light faded away, and they found themselves stumbling along in the darkness. Dorothy could not see at all, but Toto could, for some dogs see very well in the dark; and the Scarecrow declared he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) could see as well as by day. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) took hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) arm and managed to get along fairly well. <div class="bookquote">``If you see any house, or any place where we can pass the night,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you must tell me; for it is very uncomfortable walking in the dark.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Soon after the Scarecrow stopped. <div class="bookquote">``I see a little cottage at the right of us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``built of logs and branches. Shall we go there?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>answered the child. <div class="bookquote">``I am all tired out.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>So the Scarecrow led her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) through the trees until they reached the cottage, and Dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) lay down at once, and with Toto beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) soon fell into a sound sleep. The Scarecrow, who was never tired, stood up in another corner and waited patiently until morning came. 5. The Rescue of the Tin Woodman When Dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and Toto had long been out chasing birds around him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) and squirrels. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) sat up and looked around her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). There was the Scarecrow, still standing patiently in his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) corner, waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must go and search for water,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Why do you want water?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``To wash my face clean after the dust of the road, and to drink, so the dry bread will not stick in my throat.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow thoughtfully, <div class="bookquote">``for you must sleep, and eat and drink. However, you have brains, and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>They left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a little spring of clear water, where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) breakfast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) saw there was not much bread left in the basket, and the girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to eat anything, for there was scarcely enough for herself and Toto for the day. When she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) meal, and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was startled to hear a deep groan near by. <div class="bookquote">``What was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asked timidly. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot imagine,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>replied the Scarecrow; <div class="bookquote">``but we can go and see. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>Just then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to come from behind them. They turned and walked through the forest a few steps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine that fell between the trees. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) ran to the place and then stopped short, with a little cry of surprise. One of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing beside it, with an uplifted axe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) hands, was a man made entirely of tin. His (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) head and arms and legs were jointed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) body, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) stood perfectly motionless, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) could not stir at all.
<p/>Dorothy looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while Toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) teeth. <div class="bookquote">``Did you groan? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy. '' Yes,'' answered the tin man, <div class="bookquote">``I did. I've been groaning for more than a year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me.''  (<font color='red'><b>the tin man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What can I do for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) inquired softly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke. <div class="bookquote">``Get an oil-can and oil my joints,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``They are rusted so badly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon be all right again. You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>Dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) returned and asked anxiously, <div class="bookquote">``Where are your joints?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oil my neck, first,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>replied the Tin Woodman. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) oiled it, and as it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the man could turn it himself. '' Now oil the joints in my arms,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. And Dorothy oiled them and the Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust and as good as new. The Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) axe, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) leaned against the tree. <div class="bookquote">``This is a great comfort,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I have been holding that axe in the air ever since I rusted, and I'm glad to be able to put it down at last. Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all right once more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So they oiled his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) legs until he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) could move them freely; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) thanked them again and again for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) release, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) seemed a very polite creature, and very grateful. <div class="bookquote">``I might have stood there always if you had not come along,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``so you have certainly saved my life. How did you happen to be here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We are on our way to the Emerald City to see the Great Oz,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why do you wish to see Oz? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``I want him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) to send me back to Kansas, and the Scarecrow wants him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) to put a few brains into his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) head,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) replied. The Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, I guess so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>Dorothy answered. <div class="bookquote">``It would be as easy as to give the Scarecrow brains.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``True,''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>the Tin Woodman returned. '' So, if you will allow me to join your party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me.'' <div class="bookquote">``Come along,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow Dorothy</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow heartily, and Dorothy added that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) would be pleased to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) company. So the Tin Woodman shouldered his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road that was paved with yellow brick. The Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil-can in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) basket. '' For,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if I should get caught in the rain, and rust again, I would need the oil-can badly.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party, for soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the travelers could not pass. But the Tin Woodman set to work with his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) axe and chopped so well that soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) cleared a passage for the entire party. Dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) did not notice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the side of the road. Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) was obliged to call to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) up again. <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you walk around the hole? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>asked the Tin Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>replied the Scarecrow cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``My head is stuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Oz to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) for some brains.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Tin Woodman. '' But, after all, brains are not the best things in the world.'' <div class="bookquote">``Have you any?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>inquired the Scarecrow. '' No, my head is quite empty,'' answered the Woodman. '' But once I had brains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much rather have a heart.'' <div class="bookquote">``And why is that? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>asked the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``I will tell you my story, and then you will know. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>So, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told the following story: ``I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a woodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lived.
<p/>Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone I would marry, so that I might not become lonely. ``There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon grew to love her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with all my heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) part, promised to marry me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old woman who did not want her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to marry anyone, for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was so lazy she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wished the girl to remain with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and do the cooking and the housework. So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and promised her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) two sheep and a cow if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would prevent the marriage. Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg. ``This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man could not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and had him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I was used to it. But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin girl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right leg. Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made me a leg out of tin.
<p/>After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other; but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The Wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I thought that was the end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come along, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made me a new head out of tin. ``I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than ever; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) thought of a new way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my axe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into two halves. Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body of tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of joints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did not care whether I married her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) or not. I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is still living with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There was only one danger--that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it.
<p/>However, there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart. While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me one. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story of the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) was so anxious to get a new heart. '' All the same,'' said the Scarecrow, <div class="bookquote">``I shall ask for brains instead of a heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had one.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I shall take the heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>returned the Tin Woodman; <div class="bookquote">``for brains do not make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>Dorothy did not say anything, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was puzzled to know which of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) two friends was right, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) decided if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) could only get back to Kansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had no brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) wanted. What worried her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another meal for herself and Toto would empty the basket.
<p/>To be sure, neither the Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever ate anything, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was not made of tin nor straw, and could not live unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was fed. 6. The Cowardly Lion All this time Dorothy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) companions had been walking through the thick woods. The road was still paved with yellow brick, but these were much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and the walking was not at all good. There were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine. But now and then there came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees. These sounds made the little girl's heart beat fast, for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not know what made them; but Toto knew, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) walked close to Dorothy's side, and did not even bark in return. <div class="bookquote">``How long will it be,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>the child asked of the Tin Woodman, <div class="bookquote">``before we are out of the forest?''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer, <div class="bookquote">``for I have never been to the Emerald City. But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said it was a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the city where Oz dwells the country is beautiful. But I am not afraid so long as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow, while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witch's kiss, and that will protect you from harm.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But Toto!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl anxiously. <div class="bookquote">``What will protect him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We must protect him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) ourselves if he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) is in danger,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>replied the Tin Woodman.
<p/>Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the next moment a great Lion bounded into the road. With one blow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) paw he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the road, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) struck at the Tin Woodman with his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) sharp claws. But, to the Lion's surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) could make no impression on the tin, although the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still. Little Toto, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the Lion, and the great beast had opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) mouth to bite the dog, when Dorothy, fearing Toto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed forward and slapped the Lion upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) nose as hard as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) could, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) cried out: <div class="bookquote">``Don't you dare to bite Toto! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a big beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I didn't bite him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Lion, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) nose with his (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) paw where Dorothy had hit it. '' No, but you tried to,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) retorted. <div class="bookquote">``You are nothing but a big coward.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Lion, hanging his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) head in shame. <div class="bookquote">``I've always known it. But how can I help it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, I'm sure. To think of your striking a stuffed man, like the poor Scarecrow!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) stuffed? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>asked the Lion in surprise, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) pick up the Scarecrow and set him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) feet, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) patted him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) into shape again. <div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>)'s stuffed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>replied Dorothy, who was still angry. <div class="bookquote">``That's why he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) went over so easily,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>remarked the Lion. <div class="bookquote">``It astonished me to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) whirl around so. Is the other one stuffed also?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>)'s made of tin.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) helped the Woodman up again. <div class="bookquote">``That's why he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) nearly blunted my claws,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Lion. <div class="bookquote">``When they scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back. What is that little animal you are so tender of?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) is my dog, Toto,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>answered Dorothy. <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) made of tin, or stuffed? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>asked the Lion. '' Neither. He (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>)'s a--a--a meat dog,'' said the girl. '' Oh! He (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>)'s a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that I look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>). No one would think of biting such a little thing, except a coward like me,'' continued the Lion sadly. <div class="bookquote">``What makes you a coward?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy, looking at the great beast in wonder, for he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) was as big as a small horse. <div class="bookquote">``It's a mystery,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>replied the Lion. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose I was born that way. All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave, for the Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts. I learned that if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of my way. Whenever I've met a man I've been awfully scared; but I just roared at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has always run away as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could go. If the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me, I should have run myself-- I'm such a coward; but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let them go.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But that isn't right. The King of Beasts shouldn't be a coward,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``I know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) eye with the tip of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) tail. ''
<p/>It is my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy. But whenever there is danger, my heart begins to beat fast.'' <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you have heart disease,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Tin Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``It may be,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Lion. <div class="bookquote">``If you have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>continued the Tin Woodman, <div class="bookquote">``you ought to be glad, for it proves you have a heart. For my part, I have no heart; so I cannot have heart disease.''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Lion thoughtfully, <div class="bookquote">``if I had no heart I should not be a coward.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Have you brains?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>asked the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose so. I've never looked to see,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>replied the Lion. <div class="bookquote">``I am going to the Great Oz to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) to give me some,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>remarked the Scarecrow, <div class="bookquote">``for my head is stuffed with straw.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And I am going to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) to give me a heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``And I am going to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) to send Toto and me back to Kansas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>added Dorothy. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think Oz could give me courage?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>asked the Cowardly Lion. '' Just as easily as he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) could give me brains,'' said the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``Or give me a heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Tin Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``Or send me back to Kansas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy. <div class="bookquote">``Then, if you don't mind, I'll go with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Lion, <div class="bookquote">``for my life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You will be very welcome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>answered Dorothy, <div class="bookquote">``for you will help to keep away the other wild beasts. It seems to me they must be more cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They really are,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Lion, <div class="bookquote">``but that doesn't make me any braver, and as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div><p/>So once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion walking with stately strides at Dorothy's side. Toto did not approve of this new comrade at first, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) could not forget how nearly he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) had been crushed between the Lion's great jaws. But after a time he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) became more at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be good friends. During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little thing. This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) was always careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) walked along he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) wept several tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) face and over the hinges of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) jaw, and there they rusted. When Dorothy presently asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) a question the Tin Woodman could not open his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) mouth, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) jaws were tightly rusted together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong. But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy's basket and oiled the Woodman's jaws, so that after a few moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) could talk as well as before. <div class="bookquote">``This will serve me a lesson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``to look where I step. For if I should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and crying rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Thereafter he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) walked very carefully, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) eyes on the road, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) saw a tiny ant toiling by he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) would step over it, so as not to harm it. The Tin Woodman knew very well he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) had no heart, and therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything. '' You people with hearts,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``have something to guide you, and need never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very careful. When Oz gives me a heart of course I needn't mind so much.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>7. The Journey to the Great Oz They were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the forest, for there were no houses near. The tree made a good, thick covering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a great pile of wood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that warmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) feel less lonely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) and Toto ate the last of their bread, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) did not know what they would do for breakfast. <div class="bookquote">``If you wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Lion, <div class="bookquote">``I will go into the forest and kill a deer for you. You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so peculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very good breakfast.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't! Please don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>begged the Tin Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``I should certainly weep if you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>But the Lion went away into the forest and found his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) own supper, and no one ever knew what it was, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) didn't mention it.
<p/>And the Scarecrow found a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy's basket with them, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) would not be hungry for a long time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) laughed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. His (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) dropped almost as many as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) put in the basket. But the Scarecrow did not mind how long it took him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) to fill the basket, for it enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) to keep away from the fire, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) feared a spark might get into his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) straw and burn him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) up. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) lay down to sleep. These kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) very snug and warm, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) slept soundly until morning. When it was daylight, the girl bathed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face in a little rippling brook, and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City. This was to be an eventful day for the travelers. They had hardly been walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either side. It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and looked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were many big, jagged rocks at the bottom. The sides were so steep that none of them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed that their journey must end. <div class="bookquote">``What shall we do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy despairingly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't the faintest idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Tin Woodman, and the Lion shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) shaggy mane and looked thoughtful. But the Scarecrow said, <div class="bookquote">``We cannot fly, that is certain. Neither can we climb down into this great ditch. Therefore, if we cannot jump over it, we must stop where we are.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think I could jump over it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Cowardly Lion, after measuring the distance carefully in his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) mind. '' Then we are all right,'' answered the Scarecrow, <div class="bookquote">``for you can carry us all over on your back, one at a time.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll try it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Lion. <div class="bookquote">``Who will go first?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>declared the Scarecrow, <div class="bookquote">``for, if you found that you could not jump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman badly dented on the rocks below. But if I am on your back it will not matter so much, for the fall would not hurt me at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am terribly afraid of falling, myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Cowardly Lion, <div class="bookquote">``but I suppose there is nothing to do but try it. So get on my back and we will make the attempt. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>The Scarecrow sat upon the Lion's back, and the big beast walked to the edge of the gulf and crouched down. <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you run and jump?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>asked the Scarecrow. '' Because that isn't the way we Lions do these things,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) replied. Then giving a great spring, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) shot through the air and landed safely on the other side. They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) did it, and after the Scarecrow had got down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) back the Lion sprang across the ditch again.
<p/>Dorothy thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) would go next; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) took Toto in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) arms and climbed on the Lion's back, holding tightly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) mane with one hand. The next moment it seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) were flying through the air; and then, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) had time to think about it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was safe on the other side. The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman, and then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) great leaps had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) breath short, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) panted like a big dog that has been running too long. They found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark and gloomy. After the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow brick, silently wondering, each in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) own mind, if ever they would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again. To add to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the depths of the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was in this part of the country that the Kalidahs lived. <div class="bookquote">``What are the Kalidahs? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>asked the girl. <div class="bookquote">``They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>replied the Lion, <div class="bookquote">``and with claws so long and sharp that they could tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto. I'm terribly afraid of the Kalidahs.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm not surprised that you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>returned Dorothy. <div class="bookquote">``They must be dreadful beasts. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The Lion</b></font>)</div>The Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf across the road. But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew at once he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) could not leap across it.
<p/>So they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious thought the Scarecrow said: <div class="bookquote">``Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch. If the Tin Woodman can chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk across it easily.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is a first-rate idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Lion. <div class="bookquote">``One would almost suspect you had brains in your head, instead of straw. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman</b></font>)</div>The Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) axe that the tree was soon chopped nearly through. Then the Lion put his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) strong front legs against the tree and pushed with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) might, and slowly the big tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top branches on the other side. They had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl made them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers. <div class="bookquote">``They are the Kalidahs!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble. '' Quick! '' cried the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``Let us cross over.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>So Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) arms, the Tin Woodman followed, and the Scarecrow came next. The Lion, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) was certainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) gave so loud and terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over backward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) in surprise.
<p/>But, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there were two of them and only one of him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>), the Kalidahs again rushed forward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they would do next. Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began to cross the tree. And the Lion said to Dorothy: <div class="bookquote">``We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp claws. But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I am alive.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>called the Scarecrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) had been thinking what was best to be done, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) asked the Woodman to chop away the end of the tree that rested on their side of the ditch. The Tin Woodman began to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly across, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly, snarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks at the bottom. '' Well,'' said the Cowardly Lion, drawing a long breath of relief, <div class="bookquote">``I see we are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it, for it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive. Those creatures frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Tin Woodman sadly, <div class="bookquote">``I wish I had a heart to beat. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>This adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of the forest, and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired, and had to ride on the Lion's back.
<p/>To their great joy the trees became thinner the farther they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon a broad river, flowing swiftly just before them. On the other side of the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a beautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits. They were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them. <div class="bookquote">``How shall we cross the river?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy. '' That is easily done,'' replied the Scarecrow. '' The Tin Woodman must build us a raft, so we can float to the other side.'' So the Woodman took his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) axe and began to chop down small trees to make a raft, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the riverbank a tree full of fine fruit. This pleased Dorothy, who had eaten nothing but nuts all day, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit. But it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and untiring as the Tin Woodman, and when night came the work was not done. So they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until the morning; and Dorothy dreamed of the Emerald City, and of the good Wizard Oz, who would soon send her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) own home again. 8. The Deadly Poppy Field Our little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and full of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and plums from the trees beside the river.
<p/>Behind them was the dark forest they had passed safely through, although they had suffered many discouragements; but before them was a lovely, sunny country that seemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City. To be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land. But the raft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready to start. Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) arms. When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) was big and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood upon the other end to steady it, and they had long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water. They got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of the river the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and farther away from the road of yellow brick. And the water grew so deep that the long poles would not touch the bottom. <div class="bookquote">``This is bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Tin Woodman, <div class="bookquote">``for if we cannot get to the land we shall be carried into the country of the Wicked Witch of the West, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) will enchant us and make us her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) slaves.''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And then I should get no brains,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``And I should get no courage,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Cowardly Lion. <div class="bookquote">``And I should get no heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Tin Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``And I should never get back to Kansas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>the Scarecrow continued, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) pushed so hard on his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) long pole that it stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the river. Then, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) could pull it out again--or let go--the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow was left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river. '' Good-bye!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) called after them, and they were very sorry to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>). Indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) might rust, and so dried his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) tears on Dorothy's apron. Of course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``Then, I was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believe scare the crows, at any rate. But surely there is no use for a Scarecrow stuck on a pole in the middle of a river. I am afraid I shall never have any brains, after all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>Down the stream the raft floated, and the poor Scarecrow was left far behind. Then the Lion said: <div class="bookquote">``Something must be done to save us. I think I can swim to the shore and pull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of my tail. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lion</b></font>)</div>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) sprang into the water, and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) tail. Then the Lion began to swim with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) might toward the shore. It was hard work, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) was so big; but by and by they were drawn out of the current, and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman's long pole and helped push the raft to the land.
<p/>They were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the Emerald City. <div class="bookquote">``What shall we do now? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman</b></font>)</div>asked the Tin Woodman, as the Lion lay down on the grass to let the sun dry him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We must get back to the road, in some way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy. <div class="bookquote">``The best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the road again,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>remarked the Lion. So, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) basket and they started along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had carried them. It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for the poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy. They walked along as fast as they could, Dorothy only stopping once to pick a beautiful flower; and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out: <div class="bookquote">``Look!''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman</b></font>)</div>Then they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) pole in the middle of the water, looking very lonely and sad. <div class="bookquote">``What can we do to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>)? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy. The Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know. So they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow until a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the water's edge. '' Who are you and where are you going? '' asked the Stork.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am Dorothy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl friends</b></font>)</div>answered the girl, <div class="bookquote">``and these are my friends, the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion; and we are going to the Emerald City.''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl friends</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This isn't the road,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stork</b></font>)</div>said the Stork, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) twisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) long neck and looked sharply at the queer party. <div class="bookquote">``I know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>returned Dorothy, <div class="bookquote">``but we have lost the Scarecrow, and are wondering how we shall get him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) again.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>)? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Stork</b></font>)</div>asked the Stork. '' Over there in the river,'' answered the little girl. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Stork</b></font>) wasn't so big and heavy I would get him (<font color='blue'><b>Stork</b></font>) for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stork</b></font>)</div>remarked the Stork. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Stork</b></font>) isn't heavy a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy eagerly, <div class="bookquote">``for he (<font color='blue'><b>Stork</b></font>) is stuffed with straw; and if you will bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Stork</b></font>) back to us, we shall thank you ever and ever so much.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll try,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stork</b></font>)</div>said the Stork, <div class="bookquote">``but if I find he (<font color='blue'><b>Stork</b></font>) is too heavy to carry I shall have to drop him (<font color='blue'><b>Stork</b></font>) in the river again. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Stork</b></font>)</div>So the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) came to where the Scarecrow was perched upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) pole. Then the Stork with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) great claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Stork</b></font>) up into the air and back to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin Woodman and Toto were sitting. When the Scarecrow found himself among his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) friends again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) was so happy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) hugged them all, even the Lion and Toto; and as they walked along he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) sang <div class="bookquote">``Tol-de-ri-de-oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>at every step, he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) felt so gay. <div class="bookquote">``I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall find the Stork again and do her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) some kindness in return.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stork</b></font>)</div>said the Stork, who was flying along beside them. <div class="bookquote">``I always like to help anyone in trouble. But I must go now, for my babies are waiting in the nest for me. I hope you will find the Emerald City and that Oz will help you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>replied Dorothy, and then the kind Stork flew into the air and was soon out of sight. They walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that the ground was carpeted with them. There were big yellow and white and blue and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies, which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothy's eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Aren't they beautiful?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl asked, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) breathed in the spicy scent of the bright flowers. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>answered the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``When I have brains, I shall probably like them better.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If I only had a heart, I should love them,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>added the Tin Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``I always did like flowers,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Lion. <div class="bookquote">``They seem so helpless and frail. But there are none in the forest so bright as these. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer and fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great meadow of poppies. Now it is well known that when there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers, he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) sleeps on and on forever.
<p/>But Dorothy did not know this, nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) get away from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about; so presently her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) eyes grew heavy and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) must sit down to rest and to sleep. But the Tin Woodman would not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) do this. <div class="bookquote">``We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) said; and the Scarecrow agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>). So they kept walking until Dorothy could stand no longer. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) eyes closed in spite of herself and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) forgot where she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep. <div class="bookquote">``What shall we do? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>asked the Tin Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``If we leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) here she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) will die,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Lion. <div class="bookquote">``The smell of the flowers is killing us all. I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open, and the dog is asleep already. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was true; Toto had fallen down beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) little mistress. But the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not troubled by the scent of the flowers. '' Run fast,'' said the Scarecrow to the Lion, <div class="bookquote">``and get out of this deadly flower bed as soon as you can. We will bring the little girl with us, but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>So the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) could go. In a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) was out of sight. '' Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),'' said the Scarecrow. So they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy's lap, and then they made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.
<p/>On and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded them would never end. They followed the bend of the river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast asleep among the poppies. The flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in beautiful green fields before them. <div class="bookquote">``We can do nothing for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Tin Woodman, sadly; <div class="bookquote">``for he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) is much too heavy to lift. We must leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) here to sleep on forever, and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) will dream that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) has found courage at last.''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow. '' The Lion was a very good comrade for one so cowardly. But let us go on. '' They carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far enough from the poppy field to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) breathing any more of the poison of the flowers, and here they laid her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gently on the soft grass and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). 9. The Queen of the Field Mice '' We cannot be far from the road of yellow brick, now,'' remarked the Scarecrow, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) stood beside the girl, <div class="bookquote">``for we have come nearly as far as the river carried us away. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>The Tin Woodman was about to reply when he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) heard a low growl, and turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) head -LRB-which worked beautifully on hinges-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass toward them.
<p/>It was, indeed, a great yellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something, for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open, showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of fire. As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the beast was a little gray field mouse, and although he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) had no heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) knew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty, harmless creature. So the Woodman raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) gave it a quick blow that cut the beast's head clean off from its body, and it rolled over at his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) feet in two pieces. The field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short; and coming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, thank you! Thank you ever so much for saving my life.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Woodman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't speak of it, I beg of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Woodman</b></font>)</div>replied the Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``I have no heart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may need a friend, even if it happens to be only a mouse.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Only a mouse! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the little animal, indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``Why, I am a Queen--the Queen of all the Field Mice!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Woodman, making a bow. '' Therefore you have done a great deed, as well as a brave one, in saving my life,'' added the Queen. At that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their little legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen they exclaimed: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed! How did you manage to escape the great Wildcat?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Queen</b></font>)</div><p/>They all bowed so low to the little Queen that they almost stood upon their heads. '' This funny tin man,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``killed the Wildcat and saved my life. So hereafter you must all serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildcat</b></font>), and obey his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildcat</b></font>) slightest wish.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We will! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried all the mice, in a shrill chorus. And then they scampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened from his (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) sleep, and seeing all these mice around him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) gave one bark of delight and jumped right into the middle of the group. Toto had always loved to chase mice when he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) lived in Kansas, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) saw no harm in it. But the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) arms and held him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) tight, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) called to the mice, <div class="bookquote">``Come back! Come back! Toto shall not hurt you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At this the Queen of the Mice stuck her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) head out from underneath a clump of grass and asked, in a timid voice, <div class="bookquote">``Are you sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) will not bite us?''  (<font color='red'><b>this the Queen</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Woodman; <div class="bookquote">``so do not be afraid. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>One by one the mice came creeping back, and Toto did not bark again, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) tried to get out of the Woodman's arms, and would have bitten him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) had he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) not known very well he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) was made of tin. Finally one of the biggest mice spoke. <div class="bookquote">``Is there anything we can do,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it asked, <div class="bookquote">``to repay you for saving the life of our Queen?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing that I know of,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Woodman</b></font>)</div>answered the Woodman; but the Scarecrow, who had been trying to think, but could not because his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) head was stuffed with straw, said, quickly, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes; you can save our friend, the Cowardly Lion, who is asleep in the poppy bed.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A Lion!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>cried the little Queen.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would eat us all up.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>declared the Scarecrow; <div class="bookquote">``this Lion is a coward.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Really? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Mouse</b></font>)</div>asked the Mouse. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) says so himself,'' answered the Scarecrow, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) would never hurt anyone who is our friend. If you will help us to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) I promise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) shall treat you all with kindness.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said the Queen, <div class="bookquote">``we trust you. But what shall we do?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing to obey you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes; there are thousands,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) replied. '' Then send for them all to come here as soon as possible, and let each one bring a long piece of string.'' The Queen turned to the mice that attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) and told them to go at once and get all her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) people. As soon as they heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) orders they ran away in every direction as fast as possible. <div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman, <div class="bookquote">``you must go to those trees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the Lion.''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman</b></font>)</div>So the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) soon made a truck out of the limbs of trees, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) chopped away all the leaves and branches. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) fastened it together with wooden pegs and made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk. So fast and so well did he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) work that by the time the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them. They came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big mice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a piece of string in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>It was about this time that Dorothy woke from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) long sleep and opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was greatly astonished to find herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing around and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) timidly. But the Scarecrow told her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) about everything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Permit me to introduce to you her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) Majesty, the Queen.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Dorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a curtsy, after which she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) became quite friendly with the little girl. The Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the truck, using the strings they had brought. One end of a string was tied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck. Of course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to draw it; but when all the mice had been harnessed, they were able to pull it quite easily. Even the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could sit on it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place where the Lion lay asleep. After a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was heavy, they managed to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) up on the truck. Then the Queen hurriedly gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) people the order to start, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) feared if the mice stayed among the poppies too long they also would fall asleep. At first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir the heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed from behind, and they got along better. Soon they rolled the Lion out of the poppy bed to the green fields, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) could breathe the sweet, fresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.
<p/>Dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) companion from death. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) had grown so fond of the big Lion she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was glad he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had been rescued. Then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away through the grass to their homes. The Queen of the Mice was the last to leave. <div class="bookquote">``If ever you need us again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``come out into the field and call, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance. Good-bye!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>they all answered, and away the Queen ran, while Dorothy held Toto tightly lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) should run after her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) and frighten her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). After this they sat down beside the Lion until he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) should awaken; and the Scarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tree near by, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) ate for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) dinner. 10. The Guardian of the Gate It was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) had lain among the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) did open his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) eyes and roll off the truck he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) was very glad to find himself still alive. <div class="bookquote">``I ran as fast as I could,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) said, sitting down and yawning, <div class="bookquote">``but the flowers were too strong for me. How did you get me out?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) of the field mice, and how they had generously saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) from death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said: <div class="bookquote">``I have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such little things as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as mice have saved my life. How strange it all is! But, comrades, what shall we do now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy, <div class="bookquote">``and then we can keep on to the Emerald City.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>So, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again, they all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through the soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the Great Oz dwelt. The road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was beautiful, so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades. Once more they could see fences built beside the road; but these were painted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer evidently lived, that also was painted green. They passed by several of these houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of which they were very much afraid. The people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like those of the Munchkins. <div class="bookquote">``This must be the Land of Oz,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy, <div class="bookquote">``and we are surely getting near the Emerald City.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>answered the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``Everything is green here, while in the country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color. But the people do not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I'm afraid we shall be unable to find a place to pass the night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like something to eat besides fruit,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, <div class="bookquote">``and I'm sure Toto is nearly starved. Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>So, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up to the door and knocked. A woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, <div class="bookquote">``What do you want, child, and why is that great Lion with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>A woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>answered Dorothy; <div class="bookquote">``and the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt you for the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) tame? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>asked the woman, opening the door a little wider. '' Oh, yes,'' said the girl, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is a great coward, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) will be more afraid of you than you are of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl coward</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep at the Lion, <div class="bookquote">``if that is the case you may come in, and I will give you some supper and a place to sleep. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>So they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two children and a man. The man had hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg, and was lying on the couch in a corner. They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a company, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked: <div class="bookquote">``Where are you all going?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To the Emerald City,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy, <div class="bookquote">``to see the Great Oz.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the man. <div class="bookquote">``Are you sure that Oz will see you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why not? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Why, it is said that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never lets anyone come into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) presence.
<p/>I have been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and wonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz, nor do I know of any living person who has seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) never go out?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>asked the Scarecrow. '' Never. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) Palace, and even those who wait upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) do not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) face to face.'' <div class="bookquote">``What is he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) like? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>asked the girl. <div class="bookquote">``That is hard to tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``You see, Oz is a Great Wizard, and can take on any form he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) wishes. So that some say he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) looks like a bird; and some say he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) looks like an elephant; and some say he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) looks like a cat. To others he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) appears as a beautiful fairy, or a brownie, or in any other form that pleases him (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>). But who the real Oz is, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) is in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) own form, no living person can tell.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is very strange,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy, <div class="bookquote">``but we must try, in some way, to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>), or we shall have made our journey for nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asked the man. <div class="bookquote">``I want him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to give me some brains,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow eagerly. '' Oh, Oz could do that easily enough,'' declared the man. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has more brains than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needs.'' <div class="bookquote">``And I want him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to give me a heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Tin Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``That will not trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>continued the man, <div class="bookquote">``for Oz has a large collection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And I want him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to give me courage,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Cowardly Lion. ''
<p/>Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Throne Room,'' said the man, <div class="bookquote">``which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running over. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be glad to give you some.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And I want him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to send me back to Kansas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy. '' Where is Kansas? '' asked the man, with surprise. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>replied Dorothy sorrowfully, <div class="bookquote">``but it is my home, and I'm sure it's somewhere.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will find Kansas for you. But first you must get to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and that will be a hard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) usually has his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) own way. But what do YOU want? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) continued, speaking to Toto. Toto only wagged his (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) tail; for, strange to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) could not speak. The woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered around the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) meal. The Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it was made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for lions. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all. Toto ate a little of everything, and was glad to get a good supper again. The woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in, and Toto lay down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>), while the Lion guarded the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) room so she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) might not be disturbed. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and kept quiet all night, although of course they could not sleep.
<p/>The next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they started on their way, and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them. '' That must be the Emerald City,'' said Dorothy. As they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels. Yet it was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the City. It was high and thick and of a bright green color. In front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big gate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy. There was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and heard a silvery tinkle sound within. Then the big gate swung slowly open, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched room, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds. Before them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was clothed all in green, from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet, and even his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) skin was of a greenish tint. At his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side was a large green box. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw Dorothy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) companions the man asked, <div class="bookquote">``What do you wish in the Emerald City?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We came here to see the Great Oz,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy. The man was so surprised at this answer that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat down to think it over. <div class="bookquote">``It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head in perplexity. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is powerful and terrible, and if you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of the Great Wizard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) might be angry and destroy you all in an instant.'' <div class="bookquote">``But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>replied the Scarecrow; <div class="bookquote">``it is important. And we have been told that Oz is a good Wizard.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the green man, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rules the Emerald City wisely and well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from curiosity, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face. I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the Great Oz I must take you to his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) Palace. But first you must put on the spectacles.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy. '' Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the Emerald City would blind you. Even those who live in the City must wear spectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it when the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock them.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with spectacles of every size and shape. All of them had green glasses in them. The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit Dorothy and put them over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) eyes. There were two golden bands fastened to them that passed around the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) head, where they were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the Guardian of the Gates wore around his (<font color='blue'><b>Gates</b></font>) neck. When they were on, Dorothy could not take them off
<p/>had she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) wished, but of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) did not wish to be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) said nothing. Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast with the key. Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gates</b></font>) own glasses and told them he (<font color='blue'><b>Gates</b></font>) was ready to show them to the Palace. Taking a big golden key from a peg on the wall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gates</b></font>) opened another gate, and they all followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gates</b></font>) through the portal into the streets of the Emerald City. 11. The Wonderful City of Oz Even with eyes protected by the green spectacles, Dorothy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City. The streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds. They walked over a pavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined together were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the brightness of the sun. The window panes were of green glass; even the sky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were green. There were many people--men, women, and children--walking about, and these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins. They looked at Dorothy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) strangely assorted company with wondering eyes, and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when they saw the Lion; but no one spoke to them. Many shops stood in the street, and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green.
<p/>Green candy and green pop corn were offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green hats, and green clothes of all sorts. At one place a man was selling green lemonade, and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that they paid for it with green pennies. There seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried things around in little green carts, which they pushed before them. Everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous. The Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came to a big building, exactly in the middle of the City, which was the Palace of Oz, the Great Wizard. There was a soldier before the door, dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard. <div class="bookquote">``Here are strangers,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Gates</b></font>)</div>said the Guardian of the Gates to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gates</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and they demand to see the Great Oz.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Step inside,''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>answered the soldier, <div class="bookquote">``and I will carry your message to him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>So they passed through the Palace Gates and were led into a big room with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds. The soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering this room, and when they were seated he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) said politely: <div class="bookquote">``Please make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the Throne Room and tell Oz you are here. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They had to wait a long time before the soldier returned. When, at last, he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) came back, Dorothy asked: <div class="bookquote">``Have you seen Oz?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>returned the soldier; <div class="bookquote">``I have never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>). But I spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) sat behind his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) screen and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) your message.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) will grant you an audience, if you so desire; but each one of you must enter his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) presence alone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) will admit but one each day. Therefore, as you must remain in the Palace for several days, I will have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your journey.''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl; <div class="bookquote">``that is very kind of Oz.''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>The soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl, dressed in a pretty green silk gown, entered the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had lovely green hair and green eyes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bowed low before Dorothy as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Follow me and I will show you your room.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So Dorothy said good-bye to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) friends except Toto, and taking the dog in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the Palace. It was the sweetest little room in the world, with a soft comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet counterpane. There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that shot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble basin. Beautiful green flowers stood in the windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books. When Dorothy had time to open these books she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) found them full of queer green pictures that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) laugh, they were so funny. In a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and velvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly. <div class="bookquote">``Make yourself perfectly at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the green girl, <div class="bookquote">``and if you wish for anything ring the bell.
<p/>Oz will send for you tomorrow morning.''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) also led to rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the Scarecrow; for when he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) found himself alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) room he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) stood stupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning. It would not rest him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) to lie down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) could not close his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) eyes; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most wonderful rooms in the world. The Tin Woodman lay down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) bed from force of habit, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) remembered when he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) was made of flesh; but not being able to sleep, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) passed the night moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) joints up and down to make sure they kept in good working order. The Lion would have preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being shut up in a room; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) had too much sense to let this worry him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>), so he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute. The next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch Dorothy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) dressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) in one of the prettiest gowns, made of green brocaded satin. Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around Toto's neck, and they started for the Throne Room of the Great Oz. First they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen of the court, all dressed in rich costumes.
<p/>These people had nothing to do but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the Throne Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see Oz. As Dorothy entered they looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) curiously, and one of them whispered: <div class="bookquote">``Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>answered the girl, <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) will see me.''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) will see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>said the soldier who had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) message to the Wizard, <div class="bookquote">``although he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) does not like to have people ask to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>). Indeed, at first he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) was angry and said I should send you back where you came from. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned your silver shoes he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) was very much interested. At last I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) about the mark upon your forehead, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) decided he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) would admit you to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) presence. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Wizard</b></font>)</div>Just then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, <div class="bookquote">``That is the signal. You must go into the Throne Room alone. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found herself in a wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high arched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with large emeralds set closely together. In the center of the roof was a great light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a wonderful manner. But what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble that stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems, as did everything else.
<p/>In the center of the chair was an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs whatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose and mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant. As Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and Dorothy heard a voice say: <div class="bookquote">``I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>It was not such an awful voice as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) had expected to come from the big Head; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) took courage and answered: <div class="bookquote">``I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The eyes looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) thoughtfully for a full minute. Then said the voice: <div class="bookquote">``Where did you get the silver shoes?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) and killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Where did you get the mark upon your forehead? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued the voice. '' That is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) bade me good-bye and sent me to you,'' said the girl. Again the eyes looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sharply, and they saw she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was telling the truth. Then Oz asked, <div class="bookquote">``What do you wish me to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) answered earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``I don't like your country, although it is so beautiful. And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my being away so long.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see every part of the room. And at last they looked at Dorothy again. <div class="bookquote">``Why should I do this for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Oz. '' Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard and I am only a little girl. '' <div class="bookquote">``But you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Oz. <div class="bookquote">``That just happened,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>returned Dorothy simply; <div class="bookquote">``I could not help it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Head, <div class="bookquote">``I will give you my answer. You have no right to expect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in return. In this country everyone must pay for everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) gets. If you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do something for me first. Help me and I will help you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What must I do? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>asked the girl. '' Kill the Wicked Witch of the West,'' answered Oz. <div class="bookquote">``But I cannot!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised. <div class="bookquote">``You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which bear a powerful charm. There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all this land, and when you can tell me she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) is dead I will send you back to Kansas--but not before. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div>The little girl began to weep, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was so much disappointed; and the eyes winked again and looked upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) anxiously, as if the Great Oz felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could help him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would. <div class="bookquote">``I never killed anything, willingly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sobbed. <div class="bookquote">``Even if I wanted to, how could I kill the Wicked Witch?
<p/>If you, who are Great and Terrible, cannot kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) yourself, how do you expect me to do it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do not know,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Head; <div class="bookquote">``but that is my answer, and until the Wicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again. Remember that the Witch is Wicked--tremendously Wicked--and ought to be killed. Now go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>Sorrowfully Dorothy left the Throne Room and went back where the Lion and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were waiting to hear what Oz had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``There is no hope for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) said sadly, <div class="bookquote">``for Oz will not send me home until I have killed the Wicked Witch of the West; and that I can never do. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) friends were sorry, but could do nothing to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>); so Dorothy went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep. The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Scarecrow and said: <div class="bookquote">``Come with me, for Oz has sent for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>So the Scarecrow followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) and was admitted into the great Throne Room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) saw, sitting in the emerald throne, a most lovely Lady. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) flowing green locks a crown of jewels. Growing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) shoulders were wings, gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest breath of air reached them. When the Scarecrow had bowed, as prettily as his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) straw stuffing would let him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>), before this beautiful creature, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) looked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) sweetly, and said: <div class="bookquote">``I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Now the Scarecrow, who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) of, was much astonished; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) bravely. <div class="bookquote">``I am only a Scarecrow, stuffed with straw. Therefore I have no brains, and I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead of straw, so that I may become as much a man as any other in your dominions.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why should I do this for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lady</b></font>)</div>asked the Lady. '' Because you are wise and powerful, and no one else can help me,'' answered the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``I never grant favors without some return,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Oz; <div class="bookquote">``but this much I will promise. If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West, I will bestow upon you a great many brains, and such good brains that you will be the wisest man in all the Land of Oz.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I thought you asked Dorothy to kill the Witch,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow, in surprise. '' So I did. I don't care who kills her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). But until she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) is dead I will not grant your wish. Now go, and do not seek me again until you have earned the brains you so greatly desire. '' The Scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) friends and told them what Oz had said; and Dorothy was surprised to find that the Great Wizard was not a Head, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>), but a lovely Lady. '' All the same,'' said the Scarecrow, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) needs a heart as much as the Tin Woodman. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>On the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Tin Woodman and said: <div class="bookquote">``Oz has sent for you. Follow me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman</b></font>)</div>So the Tin Woodman followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) and came to the great Throne Room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) did not know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) would find Oz a lovely Lady or a Head, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) hoped it would be the lovely Lady. '' For,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``if it is the head, I am sure I shall not be given a heart, since a head has no heart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me. But if it is the lovely Lady I shall beg hard for a heart, for all ladies are themselves said to be kindly hearted.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) saw neither the Head nor the Lady, for Oz had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast. It was nearly as big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly strong enough to hold its weight. The Beast had a head like that of a rhinoceros, only there were five eyes in its face. There were five long arms growing out of its body, and it also had five long, slim legs. Thick, woolly hair covered every part of it, and a more dreadful-looking monster could not be imagined. It was fortunate the Tin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud and fast from terror. But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all afraid, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) was much disappointed. <div class="bookquote">``I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>spoke the Beast, in a voice that was one great roar. <div class="bookquote">``Who are you, and why do you seek me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am a Woodman, and made of tin. Therefore I have no heart, and cannot love. I pray you to give me a heart that I may be as other men are.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why should I do this? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>demanded the Beast.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I ask it, and you alone can grant my request,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Woodman</b></font>)</div>answered the Woodman. Oz gave a low growl at this, but said, gruffly: <div class="bookquote">``If you indeed desire a heart, you must earn it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Oz</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Woodman</b></font>)</div>asked the Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``Help Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the Beast. <div class="bookquote">``When the Witch is dead, come to me, and I will then give you the biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz.''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman</b></font>)</div>So the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) friends and tell them of the terrible Beast he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) had seen. They all wondered greatly at the many forms the Great Wizard could take upon himself, and the Lion said: <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) is a Beast when I go to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>), I shall roar my loudest, and so frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) will grant all I ask. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) is the lovely Lady, I shall pretend to spring upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), and so compel her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) to do my bidding. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) is the great Head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) will be at my mercy; for I will roll this head all about the room until he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) promises to give us what we desire. So be of good cheer, my friends, for all will yet be well. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lion</b></font>)</div>The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the Lion to the great Throne Room and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) enter the presence of Oz. The Lion at once passed through the door, and glancing around saw, to his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) surprise, that before the throne was a Ball of Fire, so fierce and glowing he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) could scarcely bear to gaze upon it.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) first thought was that Oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) tried to go nearer, the heat was so intense that it singed his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) whiskers, and he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door. Then a low, quiet voice came from the Ball of Fire, and these were the words it spoke: <div class="bookquote">``I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>And the Lion answered, <div class="bookquote">``I am a Cowardly Lion, afraid of everything. I came to you to beg that you give me courage, so that in reality I may become the King of Beasts, as men call me.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why should I give you courage? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>demanded Oz. '' Because of all Wizards you are the greatest, and alone have power to grant my request,'' answered the Lion. The Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time, and the voice said, <div class="bookquote">``Bring me proof that the Wicked Witch is dead, and that moment I will give you courage. But as long as the Witch lives, you must remain a coward. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The Lion</b></font>)</div>The Lion was angry at this speech, but could say nothing in reply, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) stood silently gazing at the Ball of Fire it became so furiously hot that he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) turned tail and rushed from the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) was glad to find his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) friends waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>), and told them of his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) terrible interview with the Wizard. <div class="bookquote">``What shall we do now? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy sadly. <div class="bookquote">``There is only one thing we can do,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>returned the Lion, <div class="bookquote">``and that is to go to the land of the Winkies, seek out the Wicked Witch, and destroy her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But suppose we cannot?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl. ''
<p/>Then I shall never have courage,'' declared the Lion. <div class="bookquote">``And I shall never have brains,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>added the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``And I shall never have a heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>spoke the Tin Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy, beginning to cry. <div class="bookquote">``Be careful!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the green girl. <div class="bookquote">``The tears will fall on your green silk gown and spot it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>So Dorothy dried her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) eyes and said, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose we must try it; but I am sure I do not want to kill anybody, even to see Aunt Em again.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will go with you; but I'm too much of a coward to kill the Witch,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Lion. <div class="bookquote">``I will go too,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>declared the Scarecrow; <div class="bookquote">``but I shall not be of much help to you, I am such a fool.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I haven't the heart to harm even a Witch,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>remarked the Tin Woodman; <div class="bookquote">``but if you go I certainly shall go with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>Therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning, and the Woodman sharpened his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) axe on a green grindstone and had all his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) joints properly oiled. The Scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw and Dorothy put new paint on his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) eyes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) might see better. The green girl, who was very kind to them, filled Dorothy's basket with good things to eat, and fastened a little bell around Toto's neck with a green ribbon. They went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight, when they were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the back yard of the Palace, and the cackling of a hen that had laid a green egg. 12. The Search for the Wicked Witch
<p/>The soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the Emerald City until they reached the room where the Guardian of the Gates lived. This officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) great box, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) politely opened the gate for our friends. '' Which road leads to the Wicked Witch of the West?'' asked Dorothy. <div class="bookquote">``There is no road,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Gates</b></font>)</div>answered the Guardian of the Gates. '' No one ever wishes to go that way.'' <div class="bookquote">``How, then, are we to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>inquired the girl. <div class="bookquote">``That will be easy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man, <div class="bookquote">``for when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knows you are in the country of the Winkies she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will find you, and make you all her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) slaves.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow, <div class="bookquote">``for we mean to destroy her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that is different,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Gates</b></font>)</div>said the Guardian of the Gates. '' No one has ever destroyed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) before, so I naturally thought she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would make slaves of you, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has of the rest. But take care; for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is wicked and fierce, and may not allow you to destroy her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Keep to the West, where the sun sets, and you cannot fail to find her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). '' They thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gates</b></font>) and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Gates</b></font>) good-bye, and turned toward the West, walking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies and buttercups. Dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) had put on in the palace, but now, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) surprise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) found it was no longer green, but pure white. The ribbon around Toto's neck had also lost its green color and was as white as Dorothy's dress. The Emerald City was soon left far behind.
<p/>As they advanced the ground became rougher and hillier, for there were no farms nor houses in this country of the West, and the ground was untilled. In the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces, for there were no trees to offer them shade; so that before night Dorothy and Toto and the Lion were tired, and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep, with the Woodman and the Scarecrow keeping watch. Now the Wicked Witch of the West had but one eye, yet that was as powerful as a telescope, and could see everywhere. So, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) sat in the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) castle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) happened to look around and saw Dorothy lying asleep, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) friends all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). They were a long distance off, but the Wicked Witch was angry to find them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) country; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) neck. At once there came running to her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) from all directions a pack of great wolves. They had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth. <div class="bookquote">``Go to those people,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch, <div class="bookquote">``and tear them to pieces.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you not going to make them your slaves?''  (<font color='red'><b>the leader</b></font>)</div>asked the leader of the wolves. '' No,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``one is of tin, and one of straw; one is a girl and another a Lion. None of them is fit to work, so you may tear them into small pieces.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wolf</b></font>)</div>said the wolf, and he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) dashed away at full speed, followed by the others. It was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were wide awake and heard the wolves coming. <div class="bookquote">``This is my fight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Woodman, <div class="bookquote">``so get behind me and I will meet them as they come.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) axe, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) had made very sharp, and as the leader of the wolves came on the Tin Woodman swung his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) arm and chopped the wolf's head from its body, so that it immediately died. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) could raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) axe another wolf came up, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) also fell under the sharp edge of the Tin Woodman's weapon. There were forty wolves, and forty times a wolf was killed, so that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the Woodman. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) axe and sat beside the Scarecrow, who said, <div class="bookquote">``It was a good fight, friend. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>They waited until Dorothy awoke the next morning. The little girl was quite frightened when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) saw the great pile of shaggy wolves, but the Tin Woodman told her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) for saving them and sat down to breakfast, after which they started again upon their journey. Now this same morning the Wicked Witch came to the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) castle and looked out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) one eye that could see far off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) saw all her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) wolves lying dead, and the strangers still traveling through her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) country. This made her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) angrier than before, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) blew her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) silver whistle twice. Straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>), enough to darken the sky. And the Wicked Witch said to the King Crow, <div class="bookquote">``Fly at once to the strangers; peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the King Crow</b></font>)</div>The wild crows flew in one great flock toward Dorothy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) companions. When the little girl saw them coming she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was afraid. But the Scarecrow said, <div class="bookquote">``This is my battle, so lie down beside me and you will not be harmed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><p/>So they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) stood up and stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) arms. And when the crows saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) they were frightened, as these birds always are by scarecrows, and did not dare to come any nearer. But the King Crow said: <div class="bookquote">``It is only a stuffed man. I will peck his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes out. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the King Crow</b></font>)</div>The King Crow flew at the Scarecrow, who caught it by the head and twisted its neck until it died. And then another crow flew at him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>), and the Scarecrow twisted its neck also. There were forty crows, and forty times the Scarecrow twisted a neck, until at last all were lying dead beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) called to his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) companions to rise, and again they went upon their journey. When the Wicked Witch looked out again and saw all her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) crows lying in a heap, she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) got into a terrible rage, and blew three times upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) silver whistle. Forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air, and a swarm of black bees came flying toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Go to the strangers and sting them to death!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>commanded the Witch, and the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where Dorothy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) friends were walking. But the Woodman had seen them coming, and the Scarecrow had decided what to do. <div class="bookquote">``Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and the Lion,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) said to the Woodman, <div class="bookquote">``and the bees cannot sting them. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>This the Woodman did, and as Dorothy lay close beside the Lion and held Toto in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) arms, the straw covered them entirely.
<p/>The bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting, so they flew at him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) and broke off all their stings against the tin, without hurting the Woodman at all. And as bees cannot live when their stings are broken that was the end of the black bees, and they lay scattered thick about the Woodman, like little heaps of fine coal. Then Dorothy and the Lion got up, and the girl helped the Tin Woodman put the straw back into the Scarecrow again, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) was as good as ever. So they started upon their journey once more. The Wicked Witch was so angry when she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) black bees in little heaps like fine coal that she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) stamped her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) foot and tore her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) hair and gnashed her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) teeth. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) called a dozen of her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) slaves, who were the Winkies, and gave them sharp spears, telling them to go to the strangers and destroy them. The Winkies were not a brave people, but they had to do as they were told. So they marched away until they came near to Dorothy. Then the Lion gave a great roar and sprang towards them, and the poor Winkies were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could. When they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a strap, and sent them back to their work, after which she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) sat down to think what she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) should do next. She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) could not understand how all her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) plans to destroy these strangers had failed; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) was a powerful Witch, as well as a wicked one, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) soon made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) mind how to act.
<p/>There was, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a circle of diamonds and rubies running round it. This Golden Cap had a charm. Whoever owned it could call three times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey any order they were given. But no person could command these strange creatures more than three times. Twice already the Wicked Witch had used the charm of the Cap. Once was when she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) had made the Winkies her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) slaves, and set herself to rule over their country. The Winged Monkeys had helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) do this. The second time was when she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) had fought against the Great Oz himself, and driven him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) out of the land of the West. The Winged Monkeys had also helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) in doing this. Only once more could she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) use this Golden Cap, for which reason she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) did not like to do so until all her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) other powers were exhausted. But now that her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) fierce wolves and her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) wild crows and her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) stinging bees were gone, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) slaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion , she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) saw there was only one way left to destroy Dorothy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) friends. So the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) cupboard and placed it upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) head. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) stood upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) left foot and said slowly: <div class="bookquote">``Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Next she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) stood upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) right foot and said: <div class="bookquote">``Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>After this she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice: <div class="bookquote">``Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Now the charm began to work. The sky was darkened, and a low rumbling sound was heard in the air.
<p/>There was a rushing of many wings, a great chattering and laughing, and the sun came out of the dark sky to show the Wicked Witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys, each with a pair of immense and powerful wings on his (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) shoulders. One, much bigger than the others, seemed to be their leader. He (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) flew close to the Witch and said, <div class="bookquote">``You have called us for the third and last time. What do you command?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except the Lion,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Wicked Witch. <div class="bookquote">``Bring that beast to me, for I have a mind to harness him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) like a horse, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) work.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your commands shall be obeyed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the leader</b></font>)</div>said the leader. Then, with a great deal of chattering and noise, the Winged Monkeys flew away to the place where Dorothy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) friends were walking. Some of the Monkeys seized the Tin Woodman and carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) through the air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks. Here they dropped the poor Woodman, who fell a great distance to the rocks, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) lay so battered and dented that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) could neither move nor groan. Others of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow, and with their long fingers pulled all of the straw out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) clothes and head. They made his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) hat and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top branches of a tall tree. The remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and wound many coils about his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) body and head and legs, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) was unable to bite or scratch or struggle in any way.
<p/>Then they lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) up and flew away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) to the Witch's castle, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) was placed in a small yard with a high iron fence around it, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) could not escape. But Dorothy they did not harm at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) stood, with Toto in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) arms, watching the sad fate of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) comrades and thinking it would soon be her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) turn. The leader of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) long, hairy arms stretched out and his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) ugly face grinning terribly; but he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) saw the mark of the Good Witch's kiss upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) forehead and stopped short, motioning the others not to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We dare not harm this little girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) said to them, <div class="bookquote">``for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is protected by the Power of Good, and that is greater than the Power of Evil. All we can do is to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to the castle of the Wicked Witch and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) there.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So, carefully and gently, they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) swiftly through the air until they came to the castle, where they set her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) down upon the front doorstep. Then the leader said to the Witch: <div class="bookquote">``We have obeyed you as far as we were able. The Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow are destroyed, and the Lion is tied up in your yard. The little girl we dare not harm, nor the dog she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) carries in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms. Your power over our band is now ended, and you will never see us again. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>Then all the Winged Monkeys, with much laughing and chattering and noise, flew into the air and were soon out of sight.
<p/>The Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried when she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) saw the mark on Dorothy's forehead, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) knew well that neither the Winged Monkeys nor she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>), herself, dare hurt the girl in any way. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked down at Dorothy's feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble with fear, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) knew what a powerful charm belonged to them. At first the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) happened to look into the child's eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them was, and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the Silver Shoes gave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself, and thought, <div class="bookquote">``I can still make her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) my slave, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) does not know how to use her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) power. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) said to Dorothy, harshly and severely: <div class="bookquote">``Come with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you do not I will make an end of you, as I did of the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>Dorothy followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) through many of the beautiful rooms in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) castle until they came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood. Dorothy went to work meekly, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) mind made up to work as hard as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) could; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>). With Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) would go into the courtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) , she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) was sure, to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) chariot whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) wished to go to drive.
<p/>But as she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and bounded at her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) so fiercely that the Witch was afraid, and ran out and shut the gate again. <div class="bookquote">``If I cannot harness you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch to the Lion, speaking through the bars of the gate, <div class="bookquote">``I can starve you. You shall have nothing to eat until you do as I wish. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>So after that she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) took no food to the imprisoned Lion; but every day she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) came to the gate at noon and asked, <div class="bookquote">``Are you ready to be harnessed like a horse?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And the Lion would answer, <div class="bookquote">``No. If you come in this yard, I will bite you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>The reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that every night, while the woman was asleep, Dorothy carried him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) food from the cupboard. After he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had eaten he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would lie down on his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) bed of straw, and Dorothy would lie beside him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) soft, shaggy mane, while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to escape. But they could find no way to get out of the castle, for it was constantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the slaves of the Wicked Witch and too afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) not to do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) told them. The girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch threatened to beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) with the same old umbrella she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) always carried in her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) hand. But, in truth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) did not dare to strike Dorothy, because of the mark upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) forehead. The child did not know this, and was full of fear for herself and Toto.
<p/>Once the Witch struck Toto a blow with her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) and bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) leg in return. The Witch did not bleed where she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) was bitten, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) was so wicked that the blood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) had dried up many years before. Dorothy's life became very sad as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) grew to understand that it would be harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again. Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) would cry bitterly for hours, with Toto sitting at her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) feet and looking into her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) face, whining dismally to show how sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) was for his (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) little mistress. Toto did not really care whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) was in Kansas or the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) knew the little girl was unhappy, and that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) unhappy too. Now the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) own the Silver Shoes which the girl always wore. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bees and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) crows and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wolves were lying in heaps and drying up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had used up all the power of the Golden Cap; but if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could only get hold of the Silver Shoes, they would give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) more power than all the other things she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had lost. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) watched Dorothy carefully, to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) ever took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) shoes, thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) might steal them. But the child was so proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) pretty shoes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) never took them off except at night and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) bath. The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in Dorothy's room at night to take the shoes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) dread of water was greater than her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) fear of the dark, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) never came near when Dorothy was bathing.
<p/>Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor ever let water touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) in any way. But the wicked creature was very cunning, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) finally thought of a trick that would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) wanted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) placed a bar of iron in the middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) magic arts made the iron invisible to human eyes. So that when Dorothy walked across the floor she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and fell at full length. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was not much hurt, but in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) fall one of the Silver Shoes came off; and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) could reach it, the Witch had snatched it away and put it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) own skinny foot. The wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) trick, for as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had one of the shoes she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) owned half the power of their charm, and Dorothy could not use it against her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>), even had she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) known how to do so. The little girl, seeing she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had lost one of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pretty shoes, grew angry, and said to the Witch, <div class="bookquote">``Give me back my shoe!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will not,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>retorted the Witch, <div class="bookquote">``for it is now my shoe, and not yours.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are a wicked creature! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>cried Dorothy. <div class="bookquote">``You have no right to take my shoe from me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I shall keep it, just the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Witch, laughing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>), '' and someday I shall get the other one from you, too. '' This made Dorothy so very angry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) picked up the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) from head to foot.
<p/>Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as Dorothy looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall away. <div class="bookquote">``See what you have done!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) screamed. '' In a minute I shall melt away.'' <div class="bookquote">``I'm very sorry, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to see the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) very eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Didn't you know water would be the end of me?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>asked the Witch, in a wailing, despairing voice. '' Of course not,'' answered Dorothy. '' How should I?'' <div class="bookquote">``Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the castle to yourself. I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought a little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds. Look out--here I go!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>With these words the Witch fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor. Seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket of water and threw it over the mess. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) then swept it all out the door. After picking out the silver shoe, which was all that was left of the old woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) foot again. Then, being at last free to do as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chose, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ran out to the courtyard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had come to an end, and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange land. 13. The Rescue
<p/>The Cowardly Lion was much pleased to hear that the Wicked Witch had been melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy at once unlocked the gate of his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) prison and set him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) free. They went in together to the castle, where Dorothy's first act was to call all the Winkies together and tell them that they were no longer slaves. There was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies, for they had been made to work hard during many years for the Wicked Witch, who had always treated them with great cruelty. They kept this day as a holiday, then and ever after, and spent the time in feasting and dancing. <div class="bookquote">``If our friends, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, were only with us,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Lion, <div class="bookquote">``I should be quite happy.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't you suppose we could rescue them?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>asked the girl anxiously. <div class="bookquote">``We can try,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>answered the Lion. So they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to rescue their friends, and the Winkies said that they would be delighted to do all in their power for Dorothy, who had set them free from bondage. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if they knew the most, and they all started away. They traveled that day and part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the Tin Woodman lay, all battered and bent. His (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) axe was near him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>), but the blade was rusted and the handle broken off short. The Winkies lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) tenderly in their arms, and carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) back to the Yellow Castle again, Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the sad plight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) old friend, and the Lion looking sober and sorry.
<p/>When they reached the castle Dorothy said to the Winkies: <div class="bookquote">``Are any of your people tinsmiths?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Winkies</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes. Some of us are very good tinsmiths,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>they told her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). '' Then bring them to me,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) said. And when the tinsmiths came, bringing with them all their tools in baskets, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) inquired, <div class="bookquote">``Can you straighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman, and bend him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) back into shape again, and solder him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) together where he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) is broken?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that they thought they could mend him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) so he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) would be as good as ever. So they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and worked for three days and four nights, hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body and head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) was straightened out into his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) old form, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) joints worked as well as ever. To be sure, there were several patches on him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>), but the tinsmiths did a good job, and as the Woodman was not a vain man he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) did not mind the patches at all. When, at last, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) walked into Dorothy's room and thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) for rescuing him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) was so pleased that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) wept tears of joy, and Dorothy had to wipe every tear carefully from his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) apron, so his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) joints would not be rusted. At the same time her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) own tears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) old friend again, and these tears did not need to be wiped away.
<p/>As for the Lion, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyes so often with the tip of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) tail that it became quite wet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it dried. <div class="bookquote">``If we only had the Scarecrow with us again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Tin Woodman, when Dorothy had finished telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) everything that had happened, <div class="bookquote">``I should be quite happy.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We must try to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl. So she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) called the Winkies to help her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and they walked all that day and part of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of which the Winged Monkeys had tossed the Scarecrow's clothes. It was a very tall tree, and the trunk was so smooth that no one could climb it; but the Woodman said at once, <div class="bookquote">``I'll chop it down, and then we can get the Scarecrow's clothes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>Now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself, another of the Winkies, who was a goldsmith, had made an axe-handle of solid gold and fitted it to the Woodman's axe, instead of the old broken handle. Others polished the blade until all the rust was removed and it glistened like burnished silver. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) had spoken, the Tin Woodman began to chop, and in a short time the tree fell over with a crash, whereupon the Scarecrow's clothes fell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground. Dorothy picked them up and had the Winkies carry them back to the castle, where they were stuffed with nice, clean straw; and behold! here was the Scarecrow, as good as ever, thanking them over and over again for saving him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>).
<p/>Now that they were reunited, Dorothy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) friends spent a few happy days at the Yellow Castle, where they found everything they needed to make them comfortable. But one day the girl thought of Aunt Em, and said, <div class="bookquote">``We must go back to Oz, and claim his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) promise.''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Woodman, <div class="bookquote">``at last I shall get my heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And I shall get my brains,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>added the Scarecrow joyfully. <div class="bookquote">``And I shall get my courage,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Lion thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``And I shall get back to Kansas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>cried Dorothy, clapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) hands. '' Oh, let us start for the Emerald City tomorrow! '' This they decided to do. The next day they called the Winkies together and bade them good-bye. The Winkies were sorry to have them go, and they had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) to stay and rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West. Finding they were determined to go, the Winkies gave Toto and the Lion each a golden collar; and to Dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with diamonds; and to the Scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking stick, to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) from stumbling; and to the Tin Woodman they offered a silver oil-can, inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels. Every one of the travelers made the Winkies a pretty speech in return, and all shook hands with them until their arms ached. Dorothy went to the Witch's cupboard to fill her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) basket with food for the journey, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) saw the Golden Cap. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) tried it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) own head and found that it fitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) exactly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) did not know anything about the charm of the Golden Cap, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) saw that it was pretty, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) mind to wear it and carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) sunbonnet in the basket. Then, being prepared for the journey, they all started for the Emerald City; and the Winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to carry with them. 14. The Winged Monkeys You will remember there was no road--not even a pathway--between the castle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City. When the four travelers went in search of the Witch she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) had seen them coming, and so sent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>). It was much harder to find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow daisies than it was being carried. They knew, of course, they must go straight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right way. But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did not know which was east and which was west, and that was the reason they were lost in the great fields. They kept on walking, however, and at night the moon came out and shone brightly. So they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning--all but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman. The next morning the sun was behind a cloud, but they started on, as if they were quite sure which way they were going. <div class="bookquote">``If we walk far enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy, <div class="bookquote">``I am sure we shall sometime come to some place.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>But day by day passed away, and they still saw nothing before them but the scarlet fields. The Scarecrow began to grumble a bit.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have surely lost our way,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and unless we find it again in time to reach the Emerald City, I shall never get my brains.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nor I my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>declared the Tin Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me I can scarcely wait till I get to Oz, and you must admit this is a very long journey.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Cowardly Lion, with a whimper, <div class="bookquote">``I haven't the courage to keep tramping forever, without getting anywhere at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>Then Dorothy lost heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) sat down on the grass and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) companions, and they sat down and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>), and Toto found that for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) was too tired to chase a butterfly that flew past his (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) head. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) tongue and panted and looked at Dorothy as if to ask what they should do next. '' Suppose we call the field mice,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) suggested. <div class="bookquote">``They could probably tell us the way to the Emerald City.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To be sure they could,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>cried the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't we think of that before? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>Dorothy blew the little whistle she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) had always carried about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) neck since the Queen of the Mice had given it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). In a few minutes they heard the pattering of tiny feet, and many of the small gray mice came running up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). Among them was the Queen herself, who asked, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) squeaky little voice: <div class="bookquote">``What can I do for my friends?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We have lost our way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy. <div class="bookquote">``Can you tell us where the Emerald City is?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>answered the Queen; <div class="bookquote">``but it is a great way off, for you have had it at your backs all this time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) noticed Dorothy's Golden Cap, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you use the charm of the Cap, and call the Winged Monkeys to you? They will carry you to the City of Oz in less than an hour.''  (<font color='red'><b>Golden Cap/Cap</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know there was a charm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>answered Dorothy, in surprise. <div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is written inside the Golden Cap,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>replied the Queen of the Mice. '' But if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away, for they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us.'' <div class="bookquote">``Won't they hurt me?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>asked the girl anxiously. '' Oh, no. They must obey the wearer of the Cap. Good-bye! '' And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) scampered out of sight, with all the mice hurrying after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Dorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon the lining. These, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) thought, must be the charm, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) read the directions carefully and put the Cap upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) head. '' Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) said, standing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) left foot. <div class="bookquote">``What did you say?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>asked the Scarecrow, who did not know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was doing. '' Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!'' Dorothy went on, standing this time on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) right foot. '' Hello!'' replied the Tin Woodman calmly. '' Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!'' said Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet. This ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them. The King bowed low before Dorothy, and asked, <div class="bookquote">``What is your command?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We wish to go to the Emerald City,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the child, <div class="bookquote">``and we have lost our way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will carry you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>replied the King, and no sooner had he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) spoken than two of the Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). Others took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion, and one little Monkey seized Toto and flew after them, although the dog tried hard to bite him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>). The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were rather frightened at first, for they remembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before; but they saw that no harm was intended, so they rode through the air quite cheerfully, and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and woods far below them. Dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest Monkeys, one of them the King himself. They had made a chair of their hands and were careful not to hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``That is a long story,''  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>answered the King, with a winged laugh; <div class="bookquote">``but as we have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by telling you about it, if you wish.''  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I shall be glad to hear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Once,''  (<font color='red'><b>the leader</b></font>)</div>began the leader, ``we were a free people, living happily in the great forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master. Perhaps some of us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull the tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing nuts at the people who walked in the forest. But we were careless and happy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the day.
<p/>This was many years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this land. ``There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who was also a powerful sorceress. All her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) magic was used to help the people, and she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was never known to hurt anyone who was good. Her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) name was Gayelette, and she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) lived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of ruby. Everyone loved her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), but her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) greatest sorrow was that she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise. At last, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) years. Gayelette made up her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) mind that when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) grew to be a man she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) would make him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) husband, so she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) ruby palace and used all her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) magic powers to make him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish. When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) grew to manhood, Quelala, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was called, was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) manly beauty was so great that Gayelette loved him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dearly, and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding. <div class="bookquote">``My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which lived in the forest near Gayelette's palace, and the old fellow loved a joke better than a good dinner. One day, just before the wedding, my grandfather was flying out with his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) band when he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) saw Quelala walking beside the river. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet, and my grandfather thought he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) would see what he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) could do.
<p/>At his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) in their arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then dropped him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) into the water. ''  (<font color='red'><b>fellow</b></font>)</div>`Swim out, my fine fellow,' cried my grandfather, `and see if the water has spotted your clothes.' Quelala was much too wise not to swim, and he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was not in the least spoiled by all his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) good fortune. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) laughed, when he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore. But when Gayelette came running out to him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) silks and velvet all ruined by the river. <div class="bookquote">``The princess was angry, and she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) knew, of course, who did it. She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had all the Winged Monkeys brought before her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) said at first that their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had treated Quelala, and dropped in the river. But my grandfather pleaded hard, for he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings tied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette finally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap. This Cap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to have cost the princess half her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) kingdom. Of course my grandfather and all the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the Golden Cap, whosoever he (<font color='blue'><b>Cap</b></font>) may be.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And what became of them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy, who had been greatly interested in the story.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied the Monkey, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Cap</b></font>) was the first to lay his (<font color='blue'><b>Cap</b></font>) wishes upon us. As his (<font color='blue'><b>Cap</b></font>) bride could not bear the sight of us, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cap</b></font>) called us all to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cap</b></font>) in the forest after he (<font color='blue'><b>Cap</b></font>) had married her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) and ordered us always to keep where she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) could never again set eyes on a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do, for we were all afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the hands of the Wicked Witch of the West, who made us enslave the Winkies, and afterward drive Oz himself out of the Land of the West. Now the Golden Cap is yours, and three times you have the right to lay your wishes upon us.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Monkey King</b></font>)</div>As the Monkey King finished his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) story Dorothy looked down and saw the green, shining walls of the Emerald City before them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) wondered at the rapid flight of the Monkeys, but was glad the journey was over. The strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of the City, the King bowed low to Dorothy, and then flew swiftly away, followed by all his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) band. <div class="bookquote">``That was a good ride,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the little girl. '' Yes, and a quick way out of our troubles,'' replied the Lion. <div class="bookquote">``How lucky it was you brought away that wonderful Cap! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>15. The Discovery of Oz, the Terrible The four travelers walked up to the great gate of Emerald City and rang the bell. After ringing several times, it was opened by the same Guardian of the Gates they had met before. '' What! are you back again? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gates</b></font>) asked, in surprise. <div class="bookquote">``Do you not see us?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>answered the Scarecrow.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I thought you had gone to visit the Wicked Witch of the West.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We did visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) let you go again?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asked the man, in wonder. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) could not help it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) is melted,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>explained the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``Melted! Well, that is good news, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. <div class="bookquote">``Who melted her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was Dorothy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Lion gravely. <div class="bookquote">``Good gracious!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bowed very low indeed before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) led them into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little room and locked the spectacles from the great box on all their eyes, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done before. Afterward they passed on through the gate into the Emerald City. When the people heard from the Guardian of the Gates that Dorothy had melted the Wicked Witch of the West, they all gathered around the travelers and followed them in a great crowd to the Palace of Oz. The soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door, but he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) let them in at once, and they were again met by the beautiful green girl, who showed each of them to their old rooms at once, so they might rest until the Great Oz was ready to receive them. The soldier had the news carried straight to Oz that Dorothy and the other travelers had come back again, after destroying the Wicked Witch; but Oz made no reply. They thought the Great Wizard would send for them at once, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) did not. They had no word from him (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) the next day, nor the next, nor the next. The waiting was tiresome and wearing, and at last they grew vexed that Oz should treat them in so poor a fashion, after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery.
<p/>So the Scarecrow at last asked the green girl to take another message to Oz, saying if he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) did not let them in to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) at once they would call the Winged Monkeys to help them, and find out whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) promises or not. When the Wizard was given this message he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) was so frightened that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) sent word for them to come to the Throne Room at four minutes after nine o'clock the next morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) had once met the Winged Monkeys in the Land of the West, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) did not wish to meet them again. The four travelers passed a sleepless night, each thinking of the gift Oz had promised to bestow on him (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>). Dorothy fell asleep only once, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) dreamed she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was in Kansas, where Aunt Em was telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) how glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) little girl at home again. Promptly at nine o'clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldier came to them, and four minutes later they all went into the Throne Room of the Great Oz. Of course each one of them expected to see the Wizard in the shape he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) had taken before, and all were greatly surprised when they looked about and saw no one at all in the room. They kept close to the door and closer to one another, for the stillness of the empty room was more dreadful than any of the forms they had seen Oz take. Presently they heard a solemn Voice, that seemed to come from somewhere near the top of the great dome, and it said: <div class="bookquote">``I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Why do you seek me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>They looked again in every part of the room, and then, seeing no one, Dorothy asked, <div class="bookquote">``Where are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am everywhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Voice</b></font>)</div>answered the Voice, <div class="bookquote">``but to the eyes of common mortals I am invisible. I will now seat myself upon my throne, that you may converse with me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Voice</b></font>)</div>Indeed, the Voice seemed just then to come straight from the throne itself; so they walked toward it and stood in a row while Dorothy said: <div class="bookquote">``We have come to claim our promise, O Oz.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What promise? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Oz. <div class="bookquote">``You promised to send me back to Kansas when the Wicked Witch was destroyed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl. <div class="bookquote">``And you promised to give me brains,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``And you promised to give me a heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Tin Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``And you promised to give me courage,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Cowardly Lion. <div class="bookquote">``Is the Wicked Witch really destroyed? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Voice</b></font>)</div>asked the Voice, and Dorothy thought it trembled a little. '' Yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I melted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) with a bucket of water.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dear me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Voice</b></font>)</div>said the Voice, <div class="bookquote">``how sudden! Well, come to me tomorrow, for I must have time to think it over.''  (<font color='red'><b>Voice</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You've had plenty of time already,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Tin Woodman angrily. <div class="bookquote">``We shan't wait a day longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``You must keep your promises to us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Dorothy. The Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the Wizard, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) gave a large, loud roar, which was so fierce and dreadful that Toto jumped away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a corner. As it fell with a crash they looked that way, and the next moment all of them were filled with wonder. For they saw, standing in just the spot the screen had hidden, a little old man, with a bald head and a wrinkled face, who seemed to be as much surprised as they were.
<p/>The Tin Woodman, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) axe, rushed toward the little man and cried out, <div class="bookquote">``Who are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the little man, in a trembling voice. <div class="bookquote">``But don't strike me--please don't--and I'll do anything you want me to. ''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>Our friends looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) in surprise and dismay. <div class="bookquote">``I thought Oz was a great Head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy. '' And I thought Oz was a lovely Lady,'' said the Scarecrow. '' And I thought Oz was a terrible Beast,'' said the Tin Woodman. '' And I thought Oz was a Ball of Fire,'' exclaimed the Lion. <div class="bookquote">``No, you are all wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the little man meekly. <div class="bookquote">``I have been making believe.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Making believe! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>cried Dorothy. <div class="bookquote">``Are you not a Great Wizard?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hush, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Don't speak so loud, or you will be overheard--and I should be ruined. I'm supposed to be a Great Wizard.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And aren't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) asked. '' Not a bit of it, my dear; I'm just a common man.'' <div class="bookquote">``You're more than that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; <div class="bookquote">``you're a humbug.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Exactly so!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>declared the little man, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands together as if it pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am a humbug.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But this is terrible,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Tin Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``How shall I ever get my heart?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Or I my courage?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>asked the Lion. <div class="bookquote">``Or I my brains?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>wailed the Scarecrow, wiping the tears from his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) coat sleeve. <div class="bookquote">``My dear friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Oz, <div class="bookquote">``I pray you not to speak of these little things. Think of me, and the terrible trouble I'm in at being found out.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't anyone else know you're a humbug?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy. '' No one knows it but you four--and myself,'' replied Oz.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have fooled everyone so long that I thought I should never be found out. It was a great mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room. Usually I will not see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something terrible.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But, I don't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy, in bewilderment. <div class="bookquote">``How was it that you appeared to me as a great Head?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That was one of my tricks,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Oz. <div class="bookquote">``Step this way, please, and I will tell you all about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room, and they all followed him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pointed to one corner, in which lay the great Head, made out of many thicknesses of paper, and with a carefully painted face. <div class="bookquote">``This I hung from the ceiling by a wire,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Oz. <div class="bookquote">``I stood behind the screen and pulled a thread, to make the eyes move and the mouth open.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But how about the voice? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) inquired. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am a ventriloquist,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the little man. <div class="bookquote">``I can throw the sound of my voice wherever I wish, so that you thought it was coming out of the Head. Here are the other things I used to deceive you.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) showed the Scarecrow the dress and the mask he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had worn when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to be the lovely Lady. And the Tin Woodman saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) terrible Beast was nothing but a lot of skins, sewn together, with slats to keep their sides out. As for the Ball of Fire, the false Wizard had hung that also from the ceiling. It was really a ball of cotton, but when oil was poured upon it the ball burned fiercely. ''
<p/>Really,'' said the Scarecrow, <div class="bookquote">``you ought to be ashamed of yourself for being such a humbug.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am--I certainly am,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the little man sorrowfully; <div class="bookquote">``but it was the only thing I could do. Sit down, please, there are plenty of chairs; and I will tell you my story.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>So they sat down and listened while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told the following tale. <div class="bookquote">``I was born in Omaha--''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, that isn't very far from Kansas!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>cried Dorothy. '' No, but it's farther from here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) sadly. <div class="bookquote">``When I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I was very well trained by a great master. I can imitate any kind of a bird or beast.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) ears and looked everywhere to see where she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was. '' After a time,'' continued Oz, <div class="bookquote">``I tired of that, and became a balloonist.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What is that? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy. '' A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd of people together and get them to pay to see the circus,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) explained. '' Oh,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I know.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>``Well, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so that I couldn't come down again. It went way up above the clouds, so far that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles away. For a day and a night I traveled through the air, and on the morning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a strange and beautiful country. <div class="bookquote">``It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit.
<p/>But I found myself in the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds, thought I was a great Wizard. Of course I let them think so, because they were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to build this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well. Then I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call it the Emerald City; and to make the name fit better I put green spectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green.'' <div class="bookquote">``But isn't everything here green?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy. '' No more than in any other city,'' replied Oz; <div class="bookquote">``but when you wear green spectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you. The Emerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man when the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now. But my people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them think it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful place, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing that is needed to make one happy. I have been good to the people, and they like me; but ever since this Palace was built, I have shut myself up and would not see any of them. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witches</b></font>)</div>One of my greatest fears was the Witches, for while I had no magical powers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to do wonderful things.
<p/>There were four of them in this country, and they ruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West. Fortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and I knew they would do me no harm; but the Witches of the East and West were terribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful than they themselves, they would surely have destroyed me. As it was, I lived in deadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how pleased I was when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East. When you came to me, I was willing to promise anything if you would only do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have melted her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>), I am ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises.'' <div class="bookquote">``I think you are a very bad man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy. '' Oh, no, my dear; I'm really a very good man, but I'm a very bad Wizard, I must admit.'' <div class="bookquote">``Can't you give me brains?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>asked the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``You don't need them. You are learning something every day. A baby has brains, but it doesn't know much. Experience is the only thing that brings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more experience you are sure to get.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That may all be true,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow, <div class="bookquote">``but I shall be very unhappy unless you give me brains. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>The false Wizard looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) carefully. '' Well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) said with a sigh, <div class="bookquote">``I'm not much of a magician, as I said; but if you will come to me tomorrow morning, I will stuff your head with brains.
<p/>I cannot tell you how to use them, however; you must find that out for yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, thank you--thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>cried the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``I'll find a way to use them, never fear!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But how about my courage? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>asked the Lion anxiously. <div class="bookquote">``You have plenty of courage, I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Oz. <div class="bookquote">``All you need is confidence in yourself. There is no living thing that is not afraid when it faces danger. The True courage is in facing danger when you are afraid, and that kind of courage you have in plenty.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I have, but I'm scared just the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Lion. <div class="bookquote">``I shall really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that makes one forget he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is afraid.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well, I will give you that sort of courage tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Oz. <div class="bookquote">``How about my heart?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>asked the Tin Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``Why, as for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Oz, <div class="bookquote">``I think you are wrong to want a heart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are in luck not to have a heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That must be a matter of opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Tin Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``For my part, I will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur, if you will give me the heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Oz meekly. <div class="bookquote">``Come to me tomorrow and you shall have a heart. I have played Wizard for so many years that I may as well continue the part a little longer.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy, <div class="bookquote">``how am I to get back to Kansas?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We shall have to think about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the little man. <div class="bookquote">``Give me two or three days to consider the matter and I'll try to find a way to carry you over the desert.
<p/>In the meantime you shall all be treated as my guests, and while you live in the Palace my people will wait upon you and obey your slightest wish. There is only one thing I ask in return for my help--such as it is. You must keep my secret and tell no one I am a humbug. ''  (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div>They agreed to say nothing of what they had learned, and went back to their rooms in high spirits. Even Dorothy had hope that <div class="bookquote">``The Great and Terrible Humbug,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>), would find a way to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) back to Kansas, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) did she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was willing to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) everything. 16. The Magic Art of the Great Humbug Next morning the Scarecrow said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) friends: <div class="bookquote">``Congratulate me. I am going to Oz to get my brains at last. When I return I shall be as other men are.''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have always liked you as you were,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy simply. <div class="bookquote">``It is kind of you to like a Scarecrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) replied. '' But surely you will think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain is going to turn out.'' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) said good-bye to them all in a cheerful voice and went to the Throne Room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) rapped upon the door. '' Come in,'' said Oz. The Scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the window, engaged in deep thought. <div class="bookquote">``I have come for my brains,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>remarked the Scarecrow, a little uneasily. '' Oh, yes; sit down in that chair, please,'' replied Oz. <div class="bookquote">``You must excuse me for taking your head off, but I shall have to do it in order to put your brains in their proper place.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are quite welcome to take my head off, as long as it will be a better one when you put it on again.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Wizard</b></font>)</div>So the Wizard unfastened his (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) head and emptied out the straw. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) entered the back room and took up a measure of bran, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) mixed with a great many pins and needles. Having shaken them together thoroughly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) filled the top of the Scarecrow's head with the mixture and stuffed the rest of the space with straw, to hold it in place. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) had fastened the Scarecrow's head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) body again he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Hereafter you will be a great man, for I have given you a lot of bran-new brains. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The Scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) greatest wish, and having thanked Oz warmly he (<font color='blue'><b>Oz</b></font>) went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oz</b></font>) friends. Dorothy looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Oz</b></font>) curiously. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oz</b></font>) head was quite bulged out at the top with brains. <div class="bookquote">``How do you feel? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``I feel wise indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oz</b></font>) answered earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``When I get used to my brains I shall know everything.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>asked the Tin Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``That is proof that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) is sharp,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>remarked the Lion. '' Well, I must go to Oz and get my heart,'' said the Woodman. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door. '' Come in,'' called Oz, and the Woodman entered and said, <div class="bookquote">``I have come for my heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the little man. '' But I shall have to cut a hole in your breast, so I can put your heart in the right place. I hope it won't hurt you.'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Woodman</b></font>)</div>answered the Woodman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not feel it at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>tinsmith</b></font>)</div>So Oz brought a pair of tinsmith's shears and cut a small, square hole in the left side of the Tin Woodman's breast. Then, going to a chest of drawers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) took out a pretty heart, made entirely of silk and stuffed with sawdust. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't it a beauty?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``It is, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>replied the Woodman, who was greatly pleased. '' But is it a kind heart?'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, very!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>answered Oz. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) put the heart in the Woodman's breast and then replaced the square of tin, soldering it neatly together where it had been cut. '' There,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``now you have a heart that any man might be proud of. I'm sorry I had to put a patch on your breast, but it really couldn't be helped.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never mind the patch,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Woodman</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the happy Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``I am very grateful to you, and shall never forget your kindness.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't speak of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Oz. Then the Tin Woodman went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) friends, who wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) every joy on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) good fortune. The Lion now walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door. '' Come in,'' said Oz. <div class="bookquote">``I have come for my courage,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>announced the Lion, entering the room. '' Very well,'' answered the little man; <div class="bookquote">``I will get it for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a square green bottle, the contents of which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) poured into a green-gold dish, beautifully carved. Placing this before the Cowardly Lion, who sniffed at it as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not like it, the Wizard said: <div class="bookquote">``Drink.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Wizard</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>asked the Lion. '' Well,'' answered Oz, <div class="bookquote">``if it were inside of you, it would be courage.
<p/>You know, of course, that courage is always inside one; so that this really cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it. Therefore I advise you to drink it as soon as possible. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The Lion</b></font>)</div>The Lion hesitated no longer, but drank till the dish was empty. <div class="bookquote">``How do you feel now?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Oz. '' Full of courage,'' replied the Lion, who went joyfully back to his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) friends to tell them of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) good fortune. Oz, left to himself, smiled to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) success in giving the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion exactly what they thought they wanted. <div class="bookquote">``How can I help being a humbug,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``when all these people make me do things that everybody knows can't be done? It was easy to make the Scarecrow and the Lion and the Woodman happy, because they imagined I could do anything. But it will take more than imagination to carry Dorothy back to Kansas, and I'm sure I don't know how it can be done. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>17. How the Balloon Was Launched For three days Dorothy heard nothing from Oz. These were sad days for the little girl, although her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) friends were all quite happy and contented. The Scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) head; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) would not say what they were because he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) knew no one could understand them but himself. When the Tin Woodman walked about he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) heart rattling around in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) breast; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) told Dorothy he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) had discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) had owned when he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) was made of flesh. The Lion declared he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) was afraid of nothing on earth, and would gladly face an army or a dozen of the fierce Kalidahs.
<p/>Thus each of the little party was satisfied except Dorothy, who longed more than ever to get back to Kansas. On the fourth day, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) great joy, Oz sent for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>), and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) entered the Throne Room he (<font color='blue'><b>Oz</b></font>) greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) pleasantly: <div class="bookquote">``Sit down, my dear; I think I have found the way to get you out of this country.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And back to Kansas? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) asked eagerly. '' Well, I'm not sure about Kansas,'' said Oz, <div class="bookquote">``for I haven't the faintest notion which way it lies. But the first thing to do is to cross the desert, and then it should be easy to find your way home.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How can I cross the desert? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) inquired. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll tell you what I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the little man. <div class="bookquote">``You see, when I came to this country it was in a balloon. You also came through the air, being carried by a cyclone. So I believe the best way to get across the desert will be through the air. Now, it is quite beyond my powers to make a cyclone; but I've been thinking the matter over, and I believe I can make a balloon.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy. '' A balloon,'' said Oz, <div class="bookquote">``is made of silk, which is coated with glue to keep the gas in it. I have plenty of silk in the Palace, so it will be no trouble to make the balloon. But in all this country there is no gas to fill the balloon with, to make it float.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If it won't float,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>remarked Dorothy, <div class="bookquote">``it will be of no use to us.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``True,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Oz. <div class="bookquote">``But there is another way to make it float, which is to fill it with hot air.
<p/>Hot air isn't as good as gas, for if the air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert, and we should be lost.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the girl. <div class="bookquote">``Are you going with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Oz. <div class="bookquote">``I am tired of being such a humbug. If I should go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a Wizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them. So I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome. I'd much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I shall be glad to have your company,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy. '' Thank you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``Now, if you will help me sew the silk together, we will begin to work on our balloon.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>So Dorothy took a needle and thread, and as fast as Oz cut the strips of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together. First there was a strip of light green silk, then a strip of dark green and then a strip of emerald green; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon in different shades of the color about them. It took three days to sew all the strips together, but when it was finished they had a big bag of green silk more than twenty feet long. Then Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue, to make it airtight, after which he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) announced that the balloon was ready. <div class="bookquote">``But we must have a basket to ride in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) said. So he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) sent the soldier with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket, which he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) fastened with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon.
<p/>When it was all ready, Oz sent word to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oz</b></font>) people that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oz</b></font>) was going to make a visit to a great brother Wizard who lived in the clouds. The news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the wonderful sight. Oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palace, and the people gazed upon it with much curiosity. The Tin Woodman had chopped a big pile of wood, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) made a fire of it, and Oz held the bottom of the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it would be caught in the silken bag. Gradually the balloon swelled out and rose into the air, until finally the basket just touched the ground. Then Oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice: <div class="bookquote">``I am now going away to make a visit. While I am gone the Scarecrow will rule over you. I command you to obey him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) as you would me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>The balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to the ground, for the air within it was hot, and this made it so much lighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into the sky. '' Come, Dorothy! '' cried the Wizard. <div class="bookquote">``Hurry up, or the balloon will fly away.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't find Toto anywhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>replied Dorothy, who did not wish to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) little dog behind. Toto had run into the crowd to bark at a kitten, and Dorothy at last found him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) picked him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) up and ran towards the balloon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was within a few steps of it, and Oz was holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Oz</b></font>) hands to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) into the basket, when, crack!
<p/>went the ropes, and the balloon rose into the air without her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). '' Come back!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) screamed. <div class="bookquote">``I want to go, too!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't come back, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>called Oz from the basket. <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye! ''  (<font color='red'><b>everyone</b></font>)</div>shouted everyone, and all eyes were turned upward to where the Wizard was riding in the basket, rising every moment farther and farther into the sky. And that was the last any of them ever saw of Oz, the Wonderful Wizard, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) may have reached Omaha safely, and be there now, for all we know. But the people remembered him (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) lovingly, and said to one another: <div class="bookquote">``Oz was always our friend. When he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was here he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) built for us this beautiful Emerald City, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is gone he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has left the Wise Scarecrow to rule over us.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Still, for many days they grieved over the loss of the Wonderful Wizard, and would not be comforted. 18. Away to the South Dorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) hope to get home to Kansas again; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) thought it all over she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) had not gone up in a balloon. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) also felt sorry at losing Oz, and so did her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) companions. The Tin Woodman came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) and said: <div class="bookquote">``Truly I should be ungrateful if I failed to mourn for the man who gave me my lovely heart. I should like to cry a little because Oz is gone, if you will kindly wipe away my tears, so that I shall not rust.''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``With pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) answered, and brought a towel at once. Then the Tin Woodman wept for several minutes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) watched the tears carefully and wiped them away with the towel.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) had finished, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) jeweled oil-can, to guard against mishap. The Scarecrow was now the ruler of the Emerald City, and although he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) was not a Wizard the people were proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>). '' For,'' they said, <div class="bookquote">``there is not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And, so far as they knew, they were quite right. The morning after the balloon had gone up with Oz, the four travelers met in the Throne Room and talked matters over. The Scarecrow sat in the big throne and the others stood respectfully before him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We are not so unlucky,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ruler</b></font>)</div>said the new ruler, <div class="bookquote">``for this Palace and the Emerald City belong to us, and we can do just as we please. When I remember that a short time ago I was up on a pole in a farmer's cornfield, and that now I am the ruler of this beautiful City, I am quite satisfied with my lot.''  (<font color='red'><b>the ruler</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I also,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Tin Woodman, <div class="bookquote">``am well-pleased with my new heart; and, really, that was the only thing I wished in all the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``For my part, I am content in knowing I am as brave as any beast that ever lived, if not braver,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>said the Lion modestly. <div class="bookquote">``If Dorothy would only be contented to live in the Emerald City,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>continued the Scarecrow, <div class="bookquote">``we might all be happy together.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I don't want to live here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>cried Dorothy. <div class="bookquote">``I want to go to Kansas, and live with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, what can be done?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Woodman</b></font>)</div>inquired the Woodman. The Scarecrow decided to think, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) thought so hard that the pins and needles began to stick out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) brains.
<p/>Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Why not call the Winged Monkeys, and ask them to carry you over the desert?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I never thought of that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy joyfully. <div class="bookquote">``It's just the thing. I'll go at once for the Golden Cap. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) brought it into the Throne Room she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) spoke the magic words, and soon the band of Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window and stood beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``This is the second time you have called us,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Monkey King</b></font>)</div>said the Monkey King, bowing before the little girl. <div class="bookquote">``What do you wish?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I want you to fly with me to Kansas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy. But the Monkey King shook his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``That cannot be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We belong to this country alone, and cannot leave it. There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet, and I suppose there never will be, for they don't belong there. We shall be glad to serve you in any way in our power, but we cannot cross the desert. Good-bye. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Monkey King</b></font>)</div>And with another bow, the Monkey King spread his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) wings and flew away through the window, followed by all his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) band. Dorothy was ready to cry with disappointment. <div class="bookquote">``I have wasted the charm of the Golden Cap to no purpose,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``for the Winged Monkeys cannot help me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is certainly too bad!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the tender-hearted Woodman. The Scarecrow was thinking again, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) head bulged out so horribly that Dorothy feared it would burst. '' Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and ask his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) advice.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly, for while Oz was alive he (<font color='blue'><b>Oz</b></font>) never was allowed to come farther than the door. ''
<p/>This little girl,'' said the Scarecrow to the soldier, <div class="bookquote">``wishes to cross the desert. How can she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) do so?''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>answered the soldier, <div class="bookquote">``for nobody has ever crossed the desert, unless it is Oz himself.''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is there no one who can help me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy earnestly. '' Glinda might,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) suggested. <div class="bookquote">``Who is Glinda?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>inquired the Scarecrow. '' The Witch of the South. She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) is the most powerful of all the Witches, and rules over the Quadlings. Besides, her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) castle stands on the edge of the desert, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) may know a way to cross it.'' <div class="bookquote">``Glinda is a Good Witch, isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>)? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>asked the child. '' The Quadlings think she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) is good,'' said the soldier, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) is kind to everyone. I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman, who knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she (<font color='blue'><b>Glinda</b></font>) has lived.''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How can I get to her (<font color='blue'><b>Glinda</b></font>) castle? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy. <div class="bookquote">``The road is straight to the South,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``but it is said to be full of dangers to travelers. There are wild beasts in the woods, and a race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country. For this reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said: <div class="bookquote">``It seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing Dorothy can do is to travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Glinda</b></font>). For, of course, if Dorothy stays here she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) will never get back to Kansas.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You must have been thinking again,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>remarked the Tin Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall go with Dorothy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>declared the Lion, <div class="bookquote">``for I am tired of your city and long for the woods and the country again. I am really a wild beast, you know. Besides, Dorothy will need someone to protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Woodman</b></font>)</div>agreed the Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``My axe may be of service to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>); so I also will go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) to the Land of the South.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``When shall we start?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>asked the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``Are you going? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they asked, in surprise. '' Certainly. If it wasn't for Dorothy I should never have had brains. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the Emerald City. So my good luck is all due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>), and I shall never leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) until she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) starts back to Kansas for good and all.'' <div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy gratefully. <div class="bookquote">``You are all very kind to me. But I should like to start as soon as possible.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We shall go tomorrow morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>returned the Scarecrow. '' So now let us all get ready, for it will be a long journey. '' 19. Attacked by the Fighting Trees The next morning Dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye, and they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers, who had walked with them as far as the gate. When the Guardian of the Gate saw them again he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful City to get into new trouble. But he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) at once unlocked their spectacles, which he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) put back into the green box, and gave them many good wishes to carry with them. <div class="bookquote">``You are now our ruler,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>) said to the Scarecrow; <div class="bookquote">``so you must come back to us as soon as possible.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly shall if I am able,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>the Scarecrow replied; <div class="bookquote">``but I must help Dorothy to get home, first.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>As Dorothy bade the good-natured Guardian a last farewell she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I have been very kindly treated in your lovely City, and everyone has been good to me. I cannot tell you how grateful I am.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't try, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``We should like to keep you with us, but if it is your wish to return to Kansas, I hope you will find a way.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) then opened the gate of the outer wall, and they walked forth and started upon their journey. The sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the Land of the South. They were all in the best of spirits, and laughed and chatted together. Dorothy was once more filled with the hope of getting home, and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were glad to be of use to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). As for the Lion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) sniffed the fresh air with delight and whisked his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country again, while Toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies, barking merrily all the time. <div class="bookquote">``City life does not agree with me at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>remarked the Lion, as they walked along at a brisk pace. <div class="bookquote">``I have lost much flesh since I lived there, and now I am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how courageous I have grown. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They now turned and took a last look at the Emerald City. All they could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls, and high up above everything the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oz was not such a bad Wizard, after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Tin Woodman, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) heart rattling around in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) breast. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) knew how to give me brains, and very good brains, too,'' said the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``If Oz had taken a dose of the same courage he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) gave me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>added the Lion, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) would have been a brave man. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>Dorothy said nothing. Oz had not kept the promise he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) had done his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) best, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) forgave him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>). As he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) was a good man, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) was a bad Wizard. The first day's journey was through the green fields and bright flowers that stretched about the Emerald City on every side. They slept that night on the grass, with nothing but the stars over them; and they rested very well indeed. In the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood. There was no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and left as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost. So they looked for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest. The Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with such wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass underneath. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) walked forward to the tree, but just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) came under the first branches they bent down and twined around him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>), and the next minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) fellow travelers. This did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) looked rather dizzy when Dorothy picked him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is another space between the trees,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>called the Lion. '' Let me try it first,'' said the Scarecrow, <div class="bookquote">``for it doesn't hurt me to get thrown about.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) walked up to another tree, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) spoke, but its branches immediately seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) and tossed him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) back again. <div class="bookquote">``This is strange,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Dorothy. <div class="bookquote">``What shall we do?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop our journey,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>remarked the Lion. <div class="bookquote">``I believe I will try it myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Woodman, and shouldering his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) axe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so roughly. When a big branch bent down to seize him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) the Woodman chopped at it so fiercely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) cut it in two. At once the tree began shaking all its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed safely under it. <div class="bookquote">``Come on!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) shouted to the others. <div class="bookquote">``Be quick!''  (<font color='red'><b>Toto</b></font>)</div>They all ran forward and passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who was caught by a small branch and shaken until he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) howled. But the Woodman promptly chopped off the branch and set the little dog free. The other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down their branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the forest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out of it. The four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came to the farther edge of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china. It was smooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their heads.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall we do now? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy. <div class="bookquote">``I will make a ladder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Tin Woodman, <div class="bookquote">``for we certainly must climb over the wall. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>20. The Dainty China Country While the Woodman was making a ladder from wood which he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) found in the forest Dorothy lay down and slept, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) was tired by the long walk. The Lion also curled himself up to sleep and Toto lay beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>). The Scarecrow watched the Woodman while he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) worked, and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``I cannot think why this wall is here, nor what it is made of.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Rest your brains and do not worry about the wall,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Woodman</b></font>)</div>replied the Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``When we have climbed over it, we shall know what is on the other side.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>After a time the ladder was finished. It looked clumsy, but the Tin Woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose. The Scarecrow waked Dorothy and the Lion and Toto, and told them that the ladder was ready. The Scarecrow climbed up the ladder first, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) was so awkward that Dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) from falling off. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) head over the top of the wall the Scarecrow said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Dorothy. So the Scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the wall, and Dorothy put her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) head over and cried, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>just as the Scarecrow had done. Then Toto came up, and immediately began to bark, but Dorothy made him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) be still. The Lion climbed the ladder next, and the Tin Woodman came last; but both of them cried, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my!''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman</b></font>)</div>as soon as they looked over the wall.
<p/>When they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall, they looked down and saw a strange sight. Before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and shining and white as the bottom of a big platter. Scattered around were many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors. These houses were quite small, the biggest of them reaching only as high as Dorothy's waist. There were also pretty little barns, with china fences around them; and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens, all made of china, were standing about in groups. But the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer country. There were milkmaids and shepherdesses, with brightly colored bodices and golden spots all over their gowns; and princesses with most gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple; and shepherds dressed in knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them, and golden buckles on their shoes; and princes with jeweled crowns upon their heads, wearing ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny clowns in ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall, pointed caps. And, strangest of all, these people were all made of china, even to their clothes, and were so small that the tallest of them was no higher than Dorothy's knee. No one did so much as look at the travelers at first, except one little purple china dog with an extra-large head, which came to the wall and barked at them in a tiny voice, afterwards running away again. <div class="bookquote">``How shall we get down?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>asked Dorothy.
<p/>They found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up, so the Scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) so that the hard floor would not hurt their feet. Of course they took pains not to light on his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) head and get the pins in their feet. When all were safely down they picked up the Scarecrow, whose body was quite flattened out, and patted his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) straw into shape again. <div class="bookquote">``We must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy, <div class="bookquote">``for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except due South. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>They began walking through the country of the china people, and the first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow. As they drew near, the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool, the pail, and even the milkmaid herself, and all fell on the china ground with a great clatter. Dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) leg off, and that the pail was lying in several small pieces, while the poor milkmaid had a nick in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) left elbow. '' There!'' cried the milkmaid angrily. <div class="bookquote">``See what you have done! My cow has broken her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) leg, and I must take her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) to the mender's shop and have it glued on again. What do you mean by coming here and frightening my cow?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm very sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>returned Dorothy. <div class="bookquote">``Please forgive us.''  (<font color='red'><b>the milkmaid</b></font>)</div>But the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) picked up the leg sulkily and led her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) cow away, the poor animal limping on three legs.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful glances over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) shoulder at the clumsy strangers, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) nicked elbow close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) side. Dorothy was quite grieved at this mishap. <div class="bookquote">``We must be very careful here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the kind-hearted Woodman, <div class="bookquote">``or we may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Woodman/Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>A little farther on Dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young Princess, who stopped short as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) saw the strangers and started to run away. Dorothy wanted to see more of the Princess, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) ran after her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). But the china girl cried out: '' Don't chase me! Don't chase me!'' She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said, <div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>answered the Princess, also stopping, a safe distance away, <div class="bookquote">``if I run I may fall down and break myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But could you not be mended? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>asked the girl. '' Oh, yes; but one is never so pretty after being mended, you know,'' replied the Princess. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy. <div class="bookquote">``Now there is Mr. Joker, one of our clowns,''  (<font color='red'><b>the china lady</b></font>)</div>continued the china lady, <div class="bookquote">``who is always trying to stand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Joker</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joker</b></font>) has broken himself so often that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joker</b></font>) is mended in a hundred places, and doesn't look at all pretty. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Joker</b></font>) comes now, so you can see for yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>the china lady</b></font>)</div>Indeed, a jolly little clown came walking toward them, and Dorothy could see that in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) pretty clothes of red and yellow and green he (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) was completely covered with cracks, running every which way and showing plainly that he (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) had been mended in many places.
<p/>The Clown put his (<font color='blue'><b>Clown</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clown</b></font>) pockets, and after puffing out his (<font color='blue'><b>Clown</b></font>) cheeks and nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Clown</b></font>) head at them saucily, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clown</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``My lady fair, Why do you stare At poor old Mr. Joker? You're quite as stiff And prim as if You'd eaten up a poker!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Be quiet, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>said the Princess. <div class="bookquote">``Can't you see these are strangers, and should be treated with respect?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's respect, I expect,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Clown</b></font>)</div>declared the Clown, and immediately stood upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Clown</b></font>) head. '' Don't mind Mr. Joker,'' said the Princess to Dorothy. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Joker</b></font>) is considerably cracked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joker</b></font>) head, and that makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Joker</b></font>) foolish.'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Joker</b></font>) a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy. '' But you are so beautiful,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``that I am sure I could love you dearly. Won't you let me carry you back to Kansas, and stand you on Aunt Em's mantel? I could carry you in my basket.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That would make me very unhappy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the china Princess</b></font>)</div>answered the china Princess. <div class="bookquote">``You see, here in our country we live contentedly, and can talk and move around as we please. But whenever any of us are taken away our joints at once stiffen, and we can only stand straight and look pretty. Of course that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and cabinets and drawing-room tables, but our lives are much pleasanter here in our own country.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I would not make you unhappy for all the world!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Dorothy. '' So I'll just say good-bye.'' <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Princess</b></font>)</div>replied the Princess. They walked carefully through the china country.
<p/>The little animals and all the people scampered out of their way, fearing the strangers would break them, and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other side of the country and came to another china wall. It was not so high as the first, however, and by standing upon the Lion's back they all managed to scramble to the top. Then the Lion gathered his (<font color='blue'><b>Lion</b></font>) legs under him (<font color='blue'><b>Lion</b></font>) and jumped on the wall; but just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lion</b></font>) jumped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lion</b></font>) upset a china church with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lion</b></font>) tail and smashed it all to pieces. <div class="bookquote">``That was too bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy, <div class="bookquote">``but really I think we were lucky in not doing these little people more harm than breaking a cow's leg and a church. They are all so brittle!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They are, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow, <div class="bookquote">``and I am thankful I am made of straw and cannot be easily damaged. There are worse things in the world than being a Scarecrow. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>21. The Lion Becomes the King of Beasts After climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves in a disagreeable country, full of bogs and marshes and covered with tall, rank grass. It was difficult to walk without falling into muddy holes, for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight. However, by carefully picking their way, they got safely along until they reached solid ground. But here the country seemed wilder than ever, and after a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered another forest, where the trees were bigger and older than any they had ever seen. <div class="bookquote">``This forest is perfectly delightful,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>declared the Lion, looking around him (<font color='blue'><b>Lion</b></font>) with joy. <div class="bookquote">``Never have I seen a more beautiful place.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It seems gloomy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>answered the Lion. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to live here all my life. See how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich and green the moss is that clings to these old trees. Surely no wild beast could wish a pleasanter home.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose there are,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>returned the Lion, <div class="bookquote">``but I do not see any of them about. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>They walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any farther. Dorothy and Toto and the Lion lay down to sleep, while the Woodman and the Scarecrow kept watch over them as usual. When morning came, they started again. Before they had gone far they heard a low rumble, as of the growling of many wild animals. Toto whimpered a little, but none of the others was frightened, and they kept along the well-trodden path until they came to an opening in the wood, in which were gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety. There were tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the others in the natural history, and for a moment Dorothy was afraid. But the Lion explained that the animals were holding a meeting, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) judged by their snarling and growling that they were in great trouble. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>) spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Toto</b></font>), and at once the great assemblage hushed as if by magic. The biggest of the tigers came up to the Lion and bowed, saying: <div class="bookquote">``Welcome, O King of Beasts! You have come in good time to fight our enemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What is your trouble?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>asked the Lion quietly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are all threatened,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered the tiger, <div class="bookquote">``by a fierce enemy which has lately come into this forest. It is a most tremendous monster, like a great spider, with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a tree trunk. It has eight of these long legs, and as the monster crawls through the forest he (<font color='blue'><b>enemy</b></font>) seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his (<font color='blue'><b>enemy</b></font>) mouth, where he (<font color='blue'><b>enemy</b></font>) eats it as a spider does a fly. Not one of us is safe while this fierce creature is alive, and we had called a meeting to decide how to take care of ourselves when you came among us.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Lion</b></font>)</div>The Lion thought for a moment. '' Are there any other lions in this forest?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>enemy</b></font>) asked. '' No; there were some, but the monster has eaten them all. And, besides, they were none of them nearly so large and brave as you.'' <div class="bookquote">``If I put an end to your enemy, will you bow down to me and obey me as King of the Forest?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>inquired the Lion. <div class="bookquote">``We will do that gladly,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned the tiger; and all the other beasts roared with a mighty roar: <div class="bookquote">``We will!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where is this great spider of yours now? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>asked the Lion. '' Yonder, among the oak trees,'' said the tiger, pointing with his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) forefoot. '' Take good care of these friends of mine,'' said the Lion, <div class="bookquote">``and I will go at once to fight the monster. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) bade his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) comrades good-bye and marched proudly away to do battle with the enemy. The great spider was lying asleep when the Lion found him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), and it looked so ugly that its foe turned up his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) nose in disgust.
<p/>Its legs were quite as long as the tiger had said, and its body covered with coarse black hair. It had a great mouth, with a row of sharp teeth a foot long; but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as slender as a wasp's waist. This gave the Lion a hint of the best way to attack the creature, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) knew it was easier to fight it asleep than awake, he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) gave a great spring and landed directly upon the monster's back. Then, with one blow of his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) heavy paw, all armed with sharp claws, he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) knocked the spider's head from its body. Jumping down, he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling, when he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) knew it was quite dead. The Lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) and said proudly: <div class="bookquote">``You need fear your enemy no longer.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Then the beasts bowed down to the Lion as their King, and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) promised to come back and rule over them as soon as Dorothy was safely on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) way to Kansas. 22. The Country of the Quadlings The four travelers passed through the rest of the forest in safety, and when they came out from its gloom saw before them a steep hill, covered from top to bottom with great pieces of rock. <div class="bookquote">``That will be a hard climb,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow, <div class="bookquote">``but we must get over the hill, nevertheless.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) led the way and the others followed. They had nearly reached the first rock when they heard a rough voice cry out, <div class="bookquote">``Keep back!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>asked the Scarecrow.
<p/>Then a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said, <div class="bookquote">``This hill belongs to us, and we don't allow anyone to cross it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But we must cross it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>said the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``We're going to the country of the Quadlings.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you shall not!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the voice, and there stepped from behind the rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was quite short and stout and had a big head, which was flat at the top and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no arms at all, and, seeing this , the Scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a creature could prevent them from climbing the hill. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry not to do as you wish, but we must pass over your hill whether you like it or not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) walked boldly forward. As quick as lightning the man's head shot forward and his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) neck stretched out until the top of the head, where it was flat, struck the Scarecrow in the middle and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) tumbling, over and over, down the hill. Almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body, and the man laughed harshly as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``It isn't as easy as you think!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>A chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks, and Dorothy saw hundreds of the armless Hammer-Heads upon the hillside, one behind every rock. The Lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the Scarecrow's mishap, and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) dashed up the hill. Again a head shot swiftly out, and the great Lion went rolling down the hill as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) had been struck by a cannon ball.
<p/>Dorothy ran down and helped the Scarecrow to his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) feet, and the Lion came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>), feeling rather bruised and sore, and said, <div class="bookquote">``It is useless to fight people with shooting heads; no one can withstand them.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What can we do, then? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) asked. '' Call the Winged Monkeys,'' suggested the Tin Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``You have still the right to command them once more.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) answered, and putting on the Golden Cap she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) uttered the magic words. The Monkeys were as prompt as ever, and in a few moments the entire band stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What are your commands?''  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>inquired the King of the Monkeys, bowing low. <div class="bookquote">``Carry us over the hill to the country of the Quadlings,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>answered the girl. <div class="bookquote">``It shall be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>the King Toto</b></font>)</div>said the King, and at once the Winged Monkeys caught the four travelers and Toto up in their arms and flew away with them. As they passed over the hill the Hammer-Heads yelled with vexation, and shot their heads high in the air, but they could not reach the Winged Monkeys, which carried Dorothy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) comrades safely over the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the Quadlings. <div class="bookquote">``This is the last time you can summon us,''  (<font color='red'><b>the leader</b></font>)</div>said the leader to Dorothy; <div class="bookquote">``so good-bye and good luck to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, and thank you very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>returned the girl; and the Monkeys rose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling. The country of the Quadlings seemed rich and happy. There was field upon field of ripening grain, with well-paved roads running between, and pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them.
<p/>The fences and houses and bridges were all painted bright red, just as they had been painted yellow in the country of the Winkies and blue in the country of the Munchkins. The Quadlings themselves, who were short and fat and looked chubby and good-natured, were dressed all in red, which showed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain. The Monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse, and the four travelers walked up to it and knocked at the door. It was opened by the farmer's wife, and when Dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them all a good dinner, with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies, and a bowl of milk for Toto. <div class="bookquote">``How far is it to the Castle of Glinda? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>asked the child. <div class="bookquote">``It is not a great way,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>answered the farmer's wife. <div class="bookquote">``Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>Thanking the good woman, they started afresh and walked by the fields and across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very beautiful Castle. Before the gates were three young girls, dressed in handsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid; and as Dorothy approached, one of them said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Why have you come to the South Country?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To see the Good Witch who rules here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``Will you take me to her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let me have your name, and I will ask Glinda if she (<font color='blue'><b>Glinda</b></font>) will receive you.''  (<font color='red'><b>girl</b></font>)</div>They told who they were, and the girl soldier went into the Castle. After a few moments she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came back to say that Dorothy and the others were to be admitted at once. 23. Glinda The Good Witch Grants Dorothy's Wish
<p/>Before they went to see Glinda, however, they were taken to a room of the Castle, where Dorothy washed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) face and combed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) hair, and the Lion shook the dust out of his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) mane, and the Scarecrow patted himself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) best shape, and the Woodman polished his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) tin and oiled his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) joints. When they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl into a big room where the Witch Glinda sat upon a throne of rubies. She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) was both beautiful and young to their eyes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) hair was a rich red in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) shoulders. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) dress was pure white but her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) eyes were blue, and they looked kindly upon the little girl. <div class="bookquote">``What can I do for you, my child? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) asked. Dorothy told the Witch all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) story: how the cyclone had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) to the Land of Oz, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) companions, and of the wonderful adventures they had met with. <div class="bookquote">``My greatest wish now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``is to get back to Kansas, for Aunt Em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me, and that will make her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) put on mourning; and unless the crops are better this year than they were last, I am sure Uncle Henry cannot afford it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Glinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet, upturned face of the loving little girl. '' Bless your dear heart,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Glinda</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am sure I can tell you of a way to get back to Kansas.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Glinda</b></font>) added, '' But, if I do, you must give me the Golden Cap.'' <div class="bookquote">``Willingly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Dorothy; <div class="bookquote">``indeed, it is of no use to me now, and when you have it you can command the Winged Monkeys three times.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I think I shall need their service just those three times,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>answered Glinda, smiling. Dorothy then gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) the Golden Cap, and the Witch said to the Scarecrow, <div class="bookquote">``What will you do when Dorothy has left us?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will return to the Emerald City,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``for Oz has made me its ruler and the people like me. The only thing that worries me is how to cross the hill of the Hammer-Heads.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``By means of the Golden Cap I shall command the Winged Monkeys to carry you to the gates of the Emerald City,''  (<font color='red'><b>Glinda</b></font>)</div>said Glinda, <div class="bookquote">``for it would be a shame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler.''  (<font color='red'><b>Glinda</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Am I really wonderful? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>asked the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``You are unusual,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Glinda. Turning to the Tin Woodman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Glinda</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``What will become of you when Dorothy leaves this country?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) leaned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) axe and thought a moment. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``The Winkies were very kind to me, and wanted me to rule over them after the Wicked Witch died. I am fond of the Winkies, and if I could get back again to the Country of the West, I should like nothing better than to rule over them forever.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My second command to the Winged Monkeys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Glinda</b></font>)</div>said Glinda <div class="bookquote">``will be that they carry you safely to the land of the Winkies. Your brain may not be so large to look at as those of the Scarecrow, but you are really brighter than he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) is--when you are well polished--and I am sure you will rule the Winkies wisely and well.''  (<font color='red'><b>Glinda</b></font>)</div>Then the Witch looked at the big, shaggy Lion and asked, <div class="bookquote">``When Dorothy has returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) own home, what will become of you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Over the hill of the Hammer-Heads,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``lies a grand old forest, and all the beasts that live there have made me their King. If I could only get back to this forest, I would pass my life very happily there.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My third command to the Winged Monkeys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Glinda</b></font>)</div>said Glinda, <div class="bookquote">``shall be to carry you to your forest. Then, having used up the powers of the Golden Cap, I shall give it to the King of the Monkeys, that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) band may thereafter be free for evermore.''  (<font color='red'><b>Glinda</b></font>)</div>The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion now thanked the Good Witch earnestly for her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) kindness; and Dorothy exclaimed: <div class="bookquote">``You are certainly as good as you are beautiful! But you have not yet told me how to get back to Kansas.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your Silver Shoes will carry you over the desert,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Glinda. <div class="bookquote">``If you had known their power you could have gone back to your Aunt Em the very first day you came to this country.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But then I should not have had my wonderful brains! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Scarecrow</b></font>)</div>cried the Scarecrow. <div class="bookquote">``I might have passed my whole life in the farmer's cornfield.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And I should not have had my lovely heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Tin Woodman</b></font>)</div>said the Tin Woodman. <div class="bookquote">``I might have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And I should have lived a coward forever,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div>declared the Lion, <div class="bookquote">``and no beast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lion</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This is all true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div>said Dorothy, <div class="bookquote">``and I am glad I was of use to these good friends. But now that each of them has had what he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) most desired, and each is happy in having a kingdom to rule besides
<p/>, I think I should like to go back to Kansas.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothy/DOROTHY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Silver Shoes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div>said the Good Witch, <div class="bookquote">``have wonderful powers. And one of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to any place in the world in three steps, and each step will be made in the wink of an eye. All you have to do is to knock the heels together three times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to go.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Witch</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If that is so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the child joyfully, <div class="bookquote">``I will ask them to carry me back to Kansas at once. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) arms around the Lion's neck and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lion</b></font>), patting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lion</b></font>) big head tenderly. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) kissed the Tin Woodman, who was weeping in a way most dangerous to his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodman</b></font>) joints. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) hugged the soft, stuffed body of the Scarecrow in her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) arms instead of kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>Scarecrow</b></font>) painted face, and found she (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) loving comrades. Glinda the Good stepped down from her (<font color='blue'><b>Witch</b></font>) ruby throne to give the little girl a good-bye kiss, and Dorothy thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) for all the kindness she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) had shown to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) friends and herself. Dorothy now took Toto up solemnly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) arms, and having said one last good-bye she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) clapped the heels of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) shoes together three times, saying: <div class="bookquote">``Take me home to Aunt Em!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Instantly she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was whirling through the air, so swiftly that all she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) could see or feel was the wind whistling past her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) ears. The Silver Shoes took but three steps, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) stopped so suddenly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) rolled over upon the grass several times before she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) knew where she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was. At length, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) sat up and looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>). '' Good gracious!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) cried.
