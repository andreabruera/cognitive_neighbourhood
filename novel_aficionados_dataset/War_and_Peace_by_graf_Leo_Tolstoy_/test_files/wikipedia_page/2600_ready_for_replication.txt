war and peace pre reform russian ð¾ð¹ð½ð ð¼ð ñ post reform russian ð¾ð¹ð½ð ð¼ð romanized vojna mir is novel by the russian author leo tolstoy it is regarded as central work of #world# literature and #one# of tolstoy finest literary achievements the novel chronicles the #history# of the french invasion of russia and the impact of the napoleonic era on tsarist society through the stories of five russian aristocratic #family# portions of an earlier version titled the #year# were serialized in the russian messenger from to the novel was first published in its entirety in tolstoy said #war# and peace is not novel even less is it poem and still less historical chronicle large sections especially the later chapters are philosophical discussion rather than narrative tolstoy also said that the best russian literature does not conform to standards and hence hesitated to call #war# and peace novel instead he regarded $anna_pavlovna_scherer$ karenina as his first true novel the encyclopã dia britannica states it can be argued that no single english novel attains the universality of the russian writer leo tolstoy #war# and peace only known color photograph of the author leo tolstoy taken at his yasnaya polyana estate in age by $sergey_kuzmich$ prokudin gorsky tolstoy notes from the ninth draft of #war# and peace tolstoy began writing #war# and peace in the #year# that he finally married and settled down at his country estate the first half of the book was written under the name during the writing of the second half he read widely and acknowledged schopenhauer as #one# of his main inspirations tolstoy wrote in #letter# to afanasy fet that what he has written in #war# and peace is also said by schopenhauer in the #world# as #will# and representation
however tolstoy approaches it from the #other# #side# the first draft of the novel was completed in in the periodical russkiy vestnik the russian messenger published the first #part# of this draft under the title and published more the following #year# tolstoy was dissatisfied with this version although he allowed several #part# of it to be published with different ending in he heavily rewrote the entire novel between and tolstoy #wife# sophia tolstaya copied as many as seven separate complete manuscripts before tolstoy considered it again ready for publication the version that was published in russkiy vestnik had very different ending from the version eventually published under the title #war# and peace in russians who had read the serialized version were eager to buy the complete novel and it sold out almost immediately the novel was translated almost immediately after publication into many #other# languages it is unknown why tolstoy changed the name to #war# and peace he may have borrowed the title from the work of $monsieur_pierre$ $joseph_alexeevich$ proudhon la guerre et la paix the #war# and the peace in french the title may also be another reference to titus described as being master of #war# and peace in the twelve caesars written by suetonius in the completed novel was then called voyna mir ð¾ð¹ð½ð ð¼ð in new style orthography in english #war# and peace the manuscript was re edited and annotated in russia in and since has been translated into english german french spanish dutch swedish finnish albanian korean and czech tolstoy was instrumental in bringing new kind of consciousness to the novel
his narrative structure is noted for its god like ability to hover over and within #event# but also in the #way# it swiftly and seamlessly portrayed particular character point of view his use of visual detail is often cinematic in scope using the literary equivalents of panning wide shots and close ups these devices while not exclusive to tolstoy are #part# of the new style of the novel that arose in the mid century and of which tolstoy proved himself master the standard russian text of #war# and peace is divided into four books comprising fifteen #part# and an epilogue in two #part# roughly the first half is concerned strictly with the fictional characters whereas the latter #part# as well as the second #part# of the epilogue increasingly consist of essays about the nature of #war# #power# #history# and historiography tolstoy interspersed these essays into the story in #way# that defies previous fictional convention certain abridged versions remove these essays entirely while #other# published even during tolstoy #life# simply moved these essays into an appendix the novel is set #year# before tolstoy #day# but he had spoken with #people# who lived through the french invasion of russia he read all the standard #history# available in russian and french about the napoleonic #war# and had read #letter# journals autobiographies and biographies of $napoleon_bonaparte$ and #other# key players of that era there are approximately real persons named or referred to in #war# and peace he worked from primary source materials interviews and #other# documents as well as from #history# books philosophy texts and #other# historical novels tolstoy also used great deal of his own experience in the crimean #war# to bring vivid detail and first #hand# accounts of how the imperial russian #army# was structured
tolstoy was critical of standard #history# especially military #history# in #war# and peace he explains at the start of the novel third volume his own views on how #history# ought to be written his aim was to blur the #line# between fiction and #history# to get closer to the truth as he states in volume ii cover of #war# and peace italian translation although the book is mainly in russian significant portions of dialogue are in french it has been suggested that the use of french is deliberate literary device to portray artifice while russian emerges as language of sincerity honesty and seriousness it could however also simply represent another element of the realistic style in which the book is written since french was the common language of the russian aristocracy at the #time# in #fact# the russian nobility often knew only enough russian to command their servants tolstoy illustrates this by showing that $julie_drubetskaya$ karagina character in the novel is so unfamiliar with her country native tongue that she has to take russian lessons the use of french diminishes as the book progresses it is suggested that this is to demonstrate russia freeing itself from foreign cultural domination and to show that once friendly nation has turned into an #enemy# by midway through the book several of the russian aristocracy are eager to find russian tutors for themselves in by the russian artist illarion pryanishnikov the novel spans the period to the era of $catherine_semenovna$ the great was still fresh in the #mind# of older #people# $catherine_semenovna$ had made french the language of her royal court for the next #one# hundred #year# it became social requirement for members of the russian nobility to speak french and understand french culture

it is now quite clear that from when the #war# and peace was published the very essence of what we call russian literature has become quite different acquired the new form and meaning the critic continued later strakhov was the first critic in russia who declared tolstoy novel to be masterpiece of level previously unknown in russian literature still being true slavophile he could not fail to see the novel as promoting the major slavophiliac ideas of meek russian character supremacy over the rapacious european kind using apollon grigoriev formula #year# later in discussing strakhov own book the #world# as whole tolstoy criticized both grigoriev concept of russian meekness vs western bestiality and strakhov interpretation of it among the reviewers were military #man# and authors specializing in the #war# literature most assessed highly the artfulness and realism of tolstoy #battle# scenes lachinov member of the russky invalid newspaper staff april called the #battle# of schã ngrabern scenes bearing the highest degree of historical and artistic truthfulness and totally agreed with the author view on the #battle# of borodino which some of his opponents disputed the #army# #general# and respected military writer mikhail dragomirov in an article published in oruzheiny sbornik the military almanac while disputing some of tolstoy ideas concerning the spontaneity of #war# and the role of #commander# in #battle# advised all the russian #army# #officer# to use #war# and peace as their desk book describing its #battle# scenes as incomparable and serving for an ideal manual to every textbook on theories of military art unlike professional literary critics most prominent russian writers of the #time# supported the novel wholeheartedly goncharov turgenev leskov dostoyevsky and fet have all gone on record as declaring #war# and peace the masterpiece of the russian literature
